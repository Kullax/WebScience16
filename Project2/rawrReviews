aS" Year Released: 1976 Piece Count: 53 Minifigs: 2 LEGO brought out floating boats quite early, and in many ways the first were the best  (I'll explain why later  "
p65
aS') This set in particular is interesting as it came out in two versions; one that includes the first minifigs and another that included the non-armless type  (Set 709'
p66
aS') The police signs are stickers, and are in surprisingly good condition considering the age of the set  (I am missing one sticker on the front though'
p67
aS") Note the Technic Bush and Axel; they are the old type  The position of the second figure is not a mistake; I think he's supposed to be sitting down   "
p68
aS' The first boats out by LEGO needed a weighted keel to prevent them     keeling over  (I have tested this!) I suspect this is because of the density of the old hulls and the flat bottom  '
p69
aS" but I could be wrong  (It can't be just because of the flat bottom as the new cargo ship doesn't need one ) The keel in detail  The bottom extension is for a motor"
p70
aS' (Not included, nor made by LEGO at the time ) The keel had longer studs  Even now it holds extra firmly  This is why I prefer the old design'
p71
aS' You can extend or shorten the hulls as you please, or even insert other LEGO in the middle  You can easily add wheels or any other piece to the bottom of these hulls'
p72
aS" I wish they would go back to this idea; the 4+ hulls were of this concept but were too wide  (Probably so the keel wasn't needed"
p73
aS') The old minifigs aside from having odd feet and no arms had a normal stud as the neck  Thus when you turn the head it tends to come off  I love this set!'

aS' Great review Sinner  I own the later version, 709 released in 1977  Mine no longer has decals though  The variations were minimal'

aS' Image Link from Brickset I thought I would do a pic review of the 1st Lego Castle, The Yellow Castle, #375- released in 1978  First, let me say that this set was truly "ahead of it\'s time"'
p170
aS' It introduced new building concepts (such as the hinge and new figs (most were still the armless, faceless mini-figs during this time)'
p171
aS' This set introduced me to Castle which was my first real favorite theme  I enjoyed breaking it out from the garage and building it again'
p172
aS' The majority of the pieces are 1x1, 1x2, 1x3, 1x4, 1x6, and 1x8 standard yellow bricks'
p173
aS' The set also includes yellow 1x4, 1x6x2, and 1x8x2 arches, yellow 2x2, 2x3, and 2x4 bricks, various grey plates, 1x2 black inverted slopes, red drawbridge pieces, two classic red castle doors, 8 hinges (2 for each corner), and a few other nifty pieces including six red 1x1 windows'
p174
aS' A complete inventory is available at Peeron: 375 Inventory  A view from the front  The drawbridge is 6x8  The front tower stands 12 1/3 bricks high (plenty of room for horses)'
p175
aS' The drawbridge does work  The string (originally black) is attached to the opposite side between a plate and the arches  The right side of the castle (identical to the left)'
p176
aS" I've always loved the 2x2x3 sloped bricks (and corner pieces): The back  I love these red doors  A 1x4 brick attached to the other side of the baseplate keeps intruders out"
p177
aS' That banner was the original sticker piece  Notice the wear'
p178
aS' The rear tower, largest of the towers: And backside: Two hinges at each of the corners allow the corners to open for playability: Before opening: Open: Lots of arches add to the detail of the inner walls: Inner front: This set included 14 figs (how about that for quantity)'
p179
aS' Unfortunately, I peeled off worn stickers from the shields and the breast plates years ago  The blue castle guards and knights are the keepers of the castle'
p180
aS' I still think that these helmets are the best Lego ever made  They just look good'
p181
aS" The black and white knights: And the red knights: I've always prefered to use the black and red guards and flags from the knight's joust set(s): Conclusion The Yellow Castle is truly a classic set and I'm so glad I kept the pieces to this together after all these years"
p182

aS'Theme: Hobby Sets Set name: Harley-Davidson 1000cc Set Number: 394 Price (new): 260-280 $, 185-200 Euro Price (used): 14-175 $, 10-125 Euro Pieces: 143 Year of release: 1976 Links: Peeron, Bricklink and Brickset Looking at the release date of this set makes me remember the good old times when LEGO sets stayed in production and could be found in stores for long years'
p291
aS' Yes, I hear you younger FOLs say this meant we had less variety at the time, but at least we did not have to go on a frenzy to get them all in just 1 or 2 years before they disappeared (to re-appear on the secondary market at crazy prices)'
p292
aS' Anyway, I also realise this set is older than me by 5 years (at least the first boxes of this set)'
p293
aS' I think my parents bought it when I was something like 1/2 year old, or even before, as my Father really liked the Hobby Set line and took any chance to get one, you know, for the kids, when theyll be old enough to play with them I am really happy my Father did it, too'
p294
aS' As a matter of fact, this has always been one of my favourite non-minifigure scale sets'
p295
aS' I know younger eyes will look on it and wonder how we could love and enjoy a model like this, so blocky and rough'
p296
aS' Just remember this was the best TLG designers could do with the bricks available at the time'
p297
aS' Enough about memories; lets start with the review! The Box Front The front of the box (here cut and folded to save space) shows the Harley Davidson 1000cc in all its glory upon a nice town landscape'
p298
aS' I really appreciate how TLG box designers used a real life photo of the model in a real life environment to give this Hobby Set a better background'
p299
aS' Moreover, the landscape does not distract the eye, even with its lights, since the focus is strongly set on the motorbike itself'
p300
aS' Back (and sides) The back of the box shows the model on a more neutral background and from another angle'
p301
aS' We can see the stickers in place (take a good look at them here, because I did not apply them)  The right side we also see a pic of the set from the front, and one with a child playing with it'
p302
aS' In this latter shot, the model rests upon a nice black box with a Harley Davidson sign on it'
p303
aS' I frankly do not remember if this was some sort of tray or smaller box within the LEGO one or if it is meant for publicity only'
p304
aS' Another thing we can notice on the right-most side of the box is a white band, right below the LEGO logo, sporting the sign Designed for experienced LEGO builders in various languages'
p305
aS' All in all, a really well done and professional job  Contents Inside This set includes a number of parts in mainly Black, White and Light Grey'
p306
aS' Some Blue and Yellow add nice touches of colour to the total  The parts selection is not mind-blowing, as most of the pieces had been in production, in these same colours for years'
p307
aS' Anyway, Id like to focus on a couple of details: The Milky White Technic axles as well as the Red Technic Bush Old 2 are among my favourite parts'
p308
aS' The bushes, in particular, are quite useful to build more sturdy looking tubes than what can be achieved with the newer and slimmer ones'
p309
aS' It would seem that the tile pieces appeared in the without grove version as a standard and in the with grove version as alternates (see Bricklink inventory)'
p310
aS' Notice, though that the box (above) and instructions (below) pictures all show the with grove variety  As said, there are no re-coloured parts in this set'
p311
aS' New pieces The few new molds used in this set are: Black and White Slope, Inverted 45 2 x 2 Old Type with Round Bottom Tube, Black Technic, Brick 1 x 2 with Hole Type II and Red Hinge Plate 2 x 4 with Articulated Joint  Male and Female'
p312
aS' The most interesting piece from this lot, as many of you will have noticed is the Technic, Brick 1 x 2 with Hole Type II  This kind of technic brick was use during 1976 and 1977 only'
p313
aS' It would seem TLG tried a new design variant, which did not meet success and was later replaced with the standard bricks again'
p314
aS' Nonetheless, Im sure that people who own these bricks like them for the unusual design and the possibilities they offer into adding details to their creations'
p315
aS' Instructions Cover  As usual, the instructions are not organised in the form of a booklet, but they consist of a folded double printed sheet'
p316
aS' The cover shows again the same shot as the front of the box, with bigger LEGO logo and set number and without the other additional information'
p317
aS' Back cover  Here we see the full name of the set: Harley-Davidson FLH 1200'
p318
aS' This makes me wonder: why is this set known as 394 Harley Davidson 1000cc when it is indeed a 1200cc? Anyway, what really makes me love this page is the list of stats below the photo, and in particular these two lines: H'
p319
aS'P  (?)/(not given)'
p320
aS' This calls for just one question: why did Harley-Davidson not release this info? My opinion is that since this is a motorbike built for the Police, they did not have permission to share the specifications on the motor, which was probably customised either by Harley-Davidson upon request or by the Police themselves'
p321
aS' Random page  As expected, no call-outs here, but the build is pretty straight forward and does not need them (apart for one passage well see later)'
p322
aS' The colours are easy to tell apart (in the end there is no Dark Grey in this set that could be confused with Black)'
p323
aS' Again, notice how the instructions include the with grove tiles and not the older ones'
p324
aS' Maybe this was changed during the long time this set stayed in production? The last page shows other four models included in the Hobby Set line'
p325
aS' Unfortunately, I own only one of them: the 396 Thatcher Perkins Locomotive'
p326
aS' Indeed, I would have liked to have them all! Building Start The handle bars look a bit too squared to me, but its just a minor feature, and the overall shape is still good in my opinion'
p327
aS' Notice the red hinge plate, which will be almost totally hidden in the finished model (see below), and the blue tiles which work as indicators'
p328
aS' The first steps, used to build the front wheel and windshield are really easy, until you get to the wheel'
p329
aS' In facts, the instructions do not show clearly all the pieces needed for it, and I found myself with a floating wheel for the absence of one of the Red Technic Bush Old 2 on one side (the one not visible on the instructions, of course)'
p330
aS' Not a big deal, but something that could have been done better  Motor and seat The second part of the build includes the motor, seat and saddle bags'
p331
aS' The technique used for the motor, or better the radiator, is very clever  To get the ridged feel, TLG designers used 4 Light Grey plates stuck one on the other but not completely in contact'
p332
aS' This way, the studs, while keeping the plates in position, keep them raised from one another at the same time'
p333
aS' The Yellow round bricks add some details and colour touches to this predominantly Light Grey parts of the vehicle'
p334
aS' The use of the Engine, Smooth Small, 1 x 2 Side Plates for the exhaust pipes, while quite clever, still looks a bit strange to me  Im mostly used to see them in airplanes, helicopters and spaceships'
p335
aS' Saddle-bags, a simple build for one of the iconic parts of this motorcycle  Here you see them in place, as well as get a look at the finished seat'
p336
aS' I like how LEGO designers managed to make its shape with just a few quite big bricks  The saddle bags are a really nice touch, and they work perfectly when compared to the original'
p337
aS' This is the rear wheel  As said before, only when you get to this passage in the instruction you get a real understanding of how the front wheel is supposed to be mounted as well'
p338
aS' Careful readers will notice how this is not one of the original wheels in this set  The original ones were mounted using the Technic, Gear Expert Builder 9 Tooth'
p339
aS' Unfortunately, I could only find one of them in my collection, an its used as the front wheel  By adding the rear wheel (which is shown from a better angle in the instructions), we complete the model'
p340
aS' Notice how the two technic bricks supporting the wheel are held in position by two 2x1 plates'
p341
aS' I think this was a bad case of building by compartments mentality: if TLG designers had considered this a bit more, they would have used 2 4x1 plates instead of 4 2x1'
p342
aS' On the other hand, this is not the worst case I have seen in a LEGO set, and they keep up the tradition nowadays too'
p343
aS' Finished set Front And here it is our fancy Police Harley-Davidson! Indeed, the front looks blocky and quite horrible to our eyes, but again, it was almost the best that could be done at the time'
p344
aS' I only wish they had made it a little less bulky, even though this build is clearly thought to give better stability to the wheel'
p345
aS' The Blue tiles work nicely to emphasise the indicators, the slightly unsightly red plate is normally covered by the plate sticker and the windshield, albeit being hard to see through, is nicely shaped'
p346
aS' Back The back side is less detailed than the front, but shows the red light and antenna which are typical of the Police motorbikes from this period'
p347
aS' How many times have we seen this angle in the chase scenes from TV shows like CHiPs? Side All in all, this model looks pretty sturdy (apart for the antenna, which falls off all too easily) and detailed, especially considering the limited variety of parts available and used at the time'
p348
aS' They even got so far to put a 2x2 tile as kick-stand to display it without fear of it falling on the sides! Bonus images Size comparison? What I never understood about this set is what scale it is meant to be'
p349
aS' I mean, it is clearly not minifig-scale, and it could not be technic-fig-scale (those came later)'
p350
aS' But it is not even Miniland scale! Moreover, the only other model with the same scale is the other Hobby Set motorbike, as the cars have a scale of their own and the Thatcher uses still another one! Final comments Overall, this is a great set for collectors of old models and motorbike fans, or both'
p351
aS' It does not sport a huge variety of bricks, but was a good choice at the time, and even if the result is matter-of-fact blocky when compared to the original, it implements some good solutions to minimise the LEGO brick appearance and maximise the similarity as much as possible'
p352
aS' Design & Colour scheme  9/10 (The design is as accurate as possible, apart for the front mudguard maybe, and the colours are completely in line for a Police vehicle'
p353
aS' The solutions and details included in this set justify the Expert builders label and add to the appearance, and, why not, playability of the model'
p354
aS') Parts - 8/10 (Not a huge selection, and very few new molds'
p355
aS' Nonetheless, a good source of Black and White standard parts for MOCs and one of the few sources for the extra rare Technic, Brick 1 x 2 with Hole Type II pieces'
p356
aS') Playability - 9/10 (A sturdy model which can take some serious play and swoosh-ing without falling apart'
p357
aS' The easily detachable antenna and the lack of an appropriate scale interaction with most other models make it lose one point, though'
p358
aS') Build - 7/10 (Pretty straight forward, with few nice solutions and an already mentioned slightly obscure passage in the instructions'
p359
aS') Price - 5/10 (Like most older models, especially the Hobby Set and Model Team ones, this set can be found at reasonable prices only rarely'
p360
aS' Most of the times, people are asked shameful prices for such a smallish set ) Overall: 8/10 Very good'
p361
aS' As always, questions, comments, and pic requests welcome! Edited by WhiteFang, 17 April 2011 - 06:19 PM  Indexed'
p362
aS' Great job on this review of a unique and rare set LuxorV! Considering the year it was released, this must have been a cool set back then'
p363
aS' Even up to now with all the specialized pieces and advanced building techniques, I could still appreciate the beauty of this brickbuilt Harley-Davidson police motorbike'
p364
aS" The various elements are instantly recognizable and it even has the unusual 'partly-stacked' plates technique for the motor"
p365
aS" Overall, I'd say this is an above average set that is a must-have for any hardcore LEGO collector "
p366
aS' Great review! The set is really nice, I love that the front of the motercycle can turn and the engine is just beautiful, with its half stacked bricks like KielDaMan said'
p367

p395
aS' In facts, he gave it to me as a present for my first half year'
p396
aS' Of course, that is to say he bought it for himself and used me as the official excuse! When I grew up, at first I found it to be quite boring: no minifigures, limited play features; in the end, it was just a locomotive! It soon went to forgotten-land'
p397
aS' Then, when I was about 10 years old, I one day found again the instructions booklet and saw this bright coloured big steam engine, and I suddenly wanted to build it again'
p398
aS' It would seem I finally got to the right age (at least for me) to appreciate the design of this great set'
p399
aS' But enough about memories; lets start with the review! The Box Front The front of the box (here cut and folded to save space) shows the Thatcher Perkins Locomotive in all its glory upon a nice countryside landscape'
p400
aS' I really appreciate how TLG box designers used a real life environment made of sand, gravel and pebbles to give this Hobby Set a better background'
p401
aS' Moreover, the landscape does not distract the eye, since the focus is strongly set on the locomotive itself  The box measures about 39 5 x 24 5 x 5 5 centimetres, or 15 56 x 9 65 x 2 17 inches'
p402
aS' This is more or less the size of the 4840 - The Burrow, or the Advent Calendars  Back (and sides) The back of the box shows the model on a more neutral background and from another angle'
p403
aS' We can see the stickers in place (take a good look at them here, because I did not apply them)  The right side we also see a pic of the set from the (3/4) back, and one with a child playing with it'
p404
aS' In this latter shot, the model rests upon a nice black box with a Thatcher Perkins sign on it'
p405
aS' Unlike the Harley Davidson 1000cc set, the Thatcher Perkins does not have the sign Designed for experienced LEGO builders for some reason'
p406
aS' Contents Inside This set includes a large number of parts, mainly Black, Blue and Red, with some nice Yellow to lighten it up more'
p407
aS' Parts of interest The parts selection is not exceptional, but well see this set includes some unique pieces which have not been in LEGO sets for long years since the 1980s, like the very nice Black Plate, Modified 1 x 2 with Steam Engine Cylinder, Flat Surfaces, Black Train Wheel Spoked for Motor and the Red Train Steam Drive Rod Holder - Train Steam Drive Rod group'
p408
aS' The Wheel Spoked Large, as beautiful as they were, saw the light from the production line for the last time in 1976! The only new mold used in this set is the Black and Blue Slope, Inverted 45 2 x 2 Old Type with Round Bottom Tube'
p409
aS' As you can see in the above picture, this locomotive was designed to work (well, be played with) on all kind of surfaces, so the wheels sport tyres'
p410
aS' In this picture you can see how they look without the tyres  Of course, builders can use the Thatcher Perkins on their brick-built tracks'
p411
aS' Another group of interesting parts are shown in this pic: Red Wheel Spoked 2 x 2 with Stud (and tyre), Black Brick, Modified 2 x 4 with Wheels Holder Old, Clear Bottom and Yellow Minifig, Head (Plain) - Stud Solid'
p412
aS' Many newer fans will not be familiar with the last two parts: they were standard fare in a number of sets between the 1960s and early 1990s, but then (unfortunately) they were taken out of production'
p413
aS' To be fair, the replacement of the Black Brick, Modified 2 x 4 with Wheels Holder Old, Clear Bottom with the standard technic parts was probably due to the fact that the metal pin used to connect the wheels to these bricks had a shameful tendency at getting off the wheel'
p414
aS' Too bad it could not be fixed and these parts kept in production  For those interested, here is a picture of the DSS, courtesy of Peeron'
p415
aS' Instructions Cover  As usual, the instructions are not organised in the form of a booklet, but they consist of a folded double printed sheet'
p416
aS' The cover shows again the same shot as the front of the box'
p417
aS' Back cover  Here we see the name of the set and some additional information, like the year when the first Thatcher Perkins started working (1863) and the type (4-6-0) of this locomotive, which, as shown in the image, is related to the number and position of the wheels'
p418
aS' On a side note, the pencil signs on the sides of the sheet were made by my Father while counting the parts in the set'
p419
aS' Random page  As expected, no call-outs here, but the build is pretty straight forward and does not need them  The colours are easy to tell apart'
p420
aS' Full page  As you may have noticed, all the building steps are drawn on one side of the booklet, making it more properly an instructions sheet'
p421
aS' What really makes this instruction booklet stand out in my eyes is the fact that it is indeed a poster: the building steps are all on one side, while the other is a bigger image of the completed set with the name Thatcher Perkins in yellow enclosed in an old styled red tag'
p422
aS' Building Start The build starts with the base of the locomotive, putting the 10 wheels in place and strengthening the engine  Notice the use of this illegal technique to build the bumpers'
p423
aS' LEGO, as we all know can be a tricky medium to build with, and some details need special solutions to be completed  We then start building the boiler and cabin'
p424
aS' Going up fast and steady! In the penultimate step, we build the chimney and cow catcher  Id like to spend a few more words on the chimney and how it is attached to the main body'
p425
aS' As you can see in the left picture, the 3x3 base of the chimney is asymmetrical, with a 3x2 base on one side and a combination of a 1x2 and a 1x1 plates on the other'
p426
aS' In the right picture, you see the top of the main body where the chimney will be attached; it is made of a 1x2 base and 1 1x2 tile'
p427
aS' Using another illegal technique (or at least one LEGO designers do not like much nowadays), the holes of the 3x2 plate of the chimney will connect with the studs of the 1x2 plate on the main body, giving a well centred and quite sturdy build'
p428
aS' Finished set Front The front of the model sports 3 big headlights, a nice cow catcher and the nicely detailed engine front'
p429
aS' I can almost hear it whistle! Side And here it is our good old Thatcher Perkins Locomotive! Indeed, it looks like a classic and powerful engine form one of those Spaghetti Western films, doesnt it? What I found strange in the beginning is the choice of colours (I was convinced steam engines were all black, at the time)'
p430
aS' Then I checked some pictures of the original, and I must admit the resemblance is almost perfect! Back The back side is less detailed than the front, with cabin almost devoid of details'
p431
aS' I think LEGO could have done a better job on it'
p432
aS' 3/4 Front and  Just see how good it looks from this angle, with all the tubing, moving parts and the lovely 3 headlights!  3/4 Back The back view is not as impressive, but grants us a good look at the big posterior wheels and the bumpers'
p433
aS' Bonus images Size comparison? As I stated elsewhere, I never understood what scale these Hobby Sets are meant to be  They are clearly not minifig-scale, and they are not technic-fig-scale either'
p434
aS' But they are not even Miniland scale! Moreover, they use different scales between locomotives, cars and motorbikes amongst the Hobby Set line! As I said before, the set comes with tyres on the wheels to allow a wider playing experience, not limiting this model to tracks'
p435
aS' Nonetheless, builders can assemble their own track (maybe using the vintage blue 4 5V tracks) and make the Thatcher Perkins run its proper environment'
p436
aS' Final comments Overall, this is a great set for collectors of old models and steam engines fans, or both'
p437
aS' It does not sport a huge variety of bricks, but was a good choice at the time, and even if the result is matter-of-fact a bit blocky when compared to the original, it implements some good solutions to minimise the LEGO brick appearance and maximise the similarity as much as possible'
p438
aS' Design & Colour scheme  8/10 (The design is as accurate as possible, and the colours are completely in line for the Thatcher Perkins Locomotive'
p439
aS' The solutions and details included in this set justify the Expert builders label and add to the appearance, and, why not, playability of the model'
p440
aS' Though, I still wish TLG had included more details in the cabin ) Parts - 10/10 (Quite a big selection, but only one new mould'
p441
aS' Nonetheless, a good source of Black, Blue and Red standard parts for MOCs and one of the few sources for the extra rare Black Plate, Modified 1 x 2 with Steam Engine Cylinder, Flat Surfaces, Black Train Wheel Spoked for Motor, Red Train Steam Drive Rod Holder - Train Steam Drive Rod group and Wheel Spoked Large'
p442
aS') Playability - 9/10 (A sturdy model which can take some serious play and swoosh-ing without falling apart'
p443
aS' The somewhat easily detachable chimney and the lack of an appropriate scale interaction with most other models make it lose one point, though'
p444
aS') Build - 7/10 (Pretty straight forward, with few nice solutions'
p445
aS') Price - 5/10 (Like most older models, especially the Hobby Set and Model Team ones, this set can only rarely be found at reasonable prices'
p446
aS' Most of the times, people are asked shameful prices for such a smallish set ) Overall: 8/10 Very good  More pictures can be found in this Brickshelf gallery'

aS'INDEXED 410  Payloader Theme: Legoland/Vehicle Piece Count: 28 Year Released: 1973 MSRP: ??? Links: Brickset, Lugnet, Peeron, Bricklink *Note: This set was released under the number 604 outside of the U'
p468
aS'S * Ah, classic Legoland  A time before mini-figs ever existed, and cars and buildings could be made with just a few bricks'
p469
aS' The part selection was pretty basic: bricks, plates, slopes, windows and wheels were all you needed to construct an entire town'
p470
aS' Heavy machinery could be modeled in 4-wide and be just a few bricks tall  For this review we will be taking a look at the 410 Payloader, one of LEGOs first sets of a bucket loader'
p471
aS' So grab a hard hat, we are heading to the construction yard! Box image courtesy of Bricklink  Box Contents Here we have our instructions which are obviously the older style of LEGO instructions'
p472
aS' The steps used much simpler imagery, but they get the job done  They show how to build the Payloader in seven steps  This small set has all of 28 parts in it'
p473
aS' The more interesting parts of note are the red digger arm, the bucket, the blue 1X2 brick with arm holes, and the blue 2X2 brick with the classic LEGO logo printed on it'
p474
aS' Construction In the first few steps we start building up the base  Then add the arms and start building the cab  Add the bucket, the trailer socket and finish the cab  Throw on some wheels'
p475
aS' Completed Set And with that we are finished with our nice small model  Here is the back right side  Notice how the back of the cab was left with an empty spot  Here is the left side'
p476
aS' Notice how on the top of the arm they made it so you could just push down on the tips it to make the arm lift instead of having to grab by the arm itself'
p477
aS' On the front we have the nice LEGO logo shown to remind the forgetful of what they were playing with'
p478
aS" You can also see how much space is in the bucket itself, which can't hold more than a few small plates  Finally on the back we have the trailer socket"
p479
aS' This was a nice addition to make it able to tow trailers from other sets like 685  Just dont try to bring it into your layout populated by mini-figs, they may have a problem trying to get in'
p480
aS' Other Thoughts Considering this set is nearly 37 years old, I myself am still surprised by how well the bricks have held up  I purchased this set from a thrift store a year ago for a mere 25 cents'
p481
aS' Normally when used LEGO is purchased you can expect to see scratches, marks, wearing, discoloration, etc but boy was I surprised to see how all these parts are in mint condition'
p482
aS' Even the instructions still looked like they came from a new box and not all ripped up and tattered'
p483
aS" The pieces still connect to each other nice and tight and the metal pieces for the wheels haven't rusted  This just shows that with proper care these things can last a lifetime"
p484
aS' I really would like to get a small display case to show it off  Conclusion Playability: 8/10 In addition to the standard of having rolling wheels, you also get a fully movable bucket assembly'
p485
aS' With it you can pick up smaller pieces and unload them into a dump truck  Design: 7/10 Like all other Legoland vehicles it has a very basic design, but you can still easily identify what it is'
p486
aS' Simple yet effective  Parts: 7/10 Like most other older LEGO sets, all you really get are a few basic bricks and plates'
p487
aS' However, you do get a bucket assembly and the 2X2 brick with the classic LEGO logo on it is very cool  It was also nice of LEGO to include the trailer socket so you could tow around your trailers'
p488
aS" Price: 8/10 Bricklink's history shows them to sell for around $10 USD used  While that is a bit much for a set this size, it is pretty good considering this set is over 37 years old"
p489
aS" However, if you are looking for a new boxed set be prepared to fork over about $50 USD  Overall: 8/10 This small machine would make a nice addition to your collection as a reminder of LEGO's past"
p490
aS' So what are your thoughts on this classic set? Edited by TheBrickster, 01 June 2010 - 05:55 AM '
p491
aS' Thank you very much for this wonderful review! This is the oldest Lego set in my collection'
p492
aS" I received this model from my grand parents many years ago - I'm not exactly sure who in my family it used to belong to, but it has a home with me now"
p493
aS" It's a very simple but attractive looking vehicle, and functions pretty well too  Overall, very nice "
p494
aS' Thanks for the great nostalgic review! Great pictures, I love the shiny glow of 37 year old bricks! Sets were simpler back then, but not less exciting in their own way'
p495
aS" I wasn't even born in 1973, but one of my first sets was the 1982 update of this, 6630 Bucket Loader  Almost 10 years later, but the very same bucket assembly, only the colours have changed "

p565
aS' Our neighbor, who worked for a department store called Famous-Bahr, said that the main store had a travelling LEGO display'
p566
aS' So my family filed into the car and drove into downtown St Louis to see this display'
p567
aS" To tell you the truth, I don't remember much about the display itself, but I DO remember that my parents bought me my first LEGO set  Set # 456, the Spirit of St Louis"
p568
aS' Set #: 456 (also sold as Set # 661) Name: Spirit of St Louis Theme: LEGOLAND / Large Vehicle Year: 1977 Pieces: 49 Minifigs: 0 Price: $5 00 USD? (Bricklink MISB start @ $175'
p569
aS'00 USD, Used Complete ~$35 00 USD) Links: Peeron, Bricklink, Brickset Packaging Box Front: The original box that my set came in was most likely trashed 5 minutes after returning home'
p570
aS' This image was lovingly stolen off of the Peeron page for this set  I feel lucky that I even got this much  Similarly, I have no pictures of the plastic baggies the set came in'
p571
aS" Truth be told, I can't be sure that there even WERE plastic baggies that the parts came in  THE SET Side View: Well there she is  My first set ever "
p572
aS' Actually, I seem to recall the real Spirit of St Louis was silver colored, not Black and Yellow'
p573
aS" If you need a history lesson, the Spirit of St Louis was Charles Lindbergh's plane when he made the first trans-Atlantic solo flight  More details can be found on the Wikipedia page"
p574
aS' The overall shape is pretty close, at least  The cockpit window could stand to be moved forward one stud, but everything seems to be relatively close'
p575
aS" The tail piece isn't the right shape, but it is likely the only tail piece LEGO produced at the time"
p576
aS' If you look closely, you can see the various bite marks that my brother and I inflicted over the years'
p577
aS" I know some people would be aghast that there are bite marks, but brick separators wouldn't come out for another 10 years  Besides, we were young  We didn't know any better"
p578
aS' I certainly had no idea that it would become my obsession  There are some interesting part choices here  Everything is brick and plate built, as you might expect'
p579
aS" The same set nowadays would have lots of slope, wedges and wedge plates to round things out  But LEGO was all about the brick in '77, so bricks are what we got"
p580
aS' The black inverted slopes worked pretty well asthetically as the wing struts  The wings are simple 4 x 10 plates, nice and square  There were no minifigs in this set'
p581
aS" If I remember correctly, 1977 was just about the time when minifigs made their first appearance  I know I have one other set from '77 that does include a minifg, at least"
p582
aS" I don't have a lot of comments for the following photos  I'll let the pictures speak for themselves"
p583
aS' 3/4 View Back Back 3/4 Top Front PARTS Interesting Pieces I have no idea if there were any extra pieces that came with this set  I kind of doubt it'
p584
aS" Instead I took a photo of some of the interesting parts to the model  That translucent white piece didn't photograph so well, but it is a Technic Axle 8"
p585
aS" That's right, sets from 1977 contained Technic elements  The two black parts are the forerunners to the 1 x 2 Technic Brick, as well"
p586
aS' Everytime I hear someone on the forums complain about Technic elements in system sets, I think back to this set  The round brick is special as well'
p587
aS' Here is a closer view of it, complete with bite marks   Round Brick As you can see, the stud is closed  It is only one of two closed stud 1 x 1 Round Bricks that I own'
p588
aS" They stopped appearing in sets in 1981, for those that are interested  The DSS You thought you were going to escape this heading, didn't you? Surprise! Yes, even in 1977 LEGO sets had stickers"
p589
aS' The oldest printed elements I can remember were in the Classic Space sets that started in 1979  Again, when people in the forums complain about DSS in sets, I can only help think of this set'
p590
aS" And chuckle to myself maniacally  The sticker has held up really well considering it's been stuck on the brick for 32 years  No discoloration, very little curling"
p591
aS' I think if all stickers held up this well over time, there would be less DSS complaints  THE RATINGS Playability: 6/10 - The set is quite swooshable, and the propellor spins  Outside of that, though '
p592
aS"  Minifigs: N/A Design: 6/10 - The overall shape is quite good, especially given the era  The color choice leaves a lot to be desired  Price: 1/10 - It's been retired for 30 years"
p593
aS" It's going to cost you to get your hands on it  Overall: 13/30 - This set is for true collectors only  I can't imagine anyone wanting one because they want to play with it"
p594
aS" It was a great set back in the day, but the design feels REALLY dated  And if you're wondering, mine is NOT for sale  Ever  All the photos, plus more, can be found in the Gallery "
p595
aS' Very brave to give an impression about one of the oldest sets ever reviewed! A lot members here are younger than the set itself  I think you will have to have grown up with it to like it'
p596
aS' Nowadays we have seen quite a few better airplanes than that one, for example this years 7643   But thanks for letting us know  Btw , the 1x1 round brick with the solid stud is no'
p597
aS' 3062a instead of 3062b (with the hollow stud) '
p598
aS' Great job! I love reading vintage reviews, as it reminds of our childhood days  Glad to see this in very good condition'
p599
aS' By the way, I will move this to LEGO Trains & Town, to see if TheBrickster will like to include this set inside the review index over there'

p682
aS' First a pic of the complete building: The 3 Minifigs: and i pic of the stairs (one of my highlights at this set): More pics you can find here My opinion about the set: I like this set very much, it was really fun to build it'
p683
aS' I?m happy that that i got some more cherries and a croissant now *sweet* , a funny idea is the salad in the one box at the front  i think normally it?s a hairpiece of an exoforce fig'
p684
aS' I also like the colours of the house, the dark blue is sooooo nice  I think i have to take more of this soon  The lighter blue is also nice'
p685
aS' This set has really nice details like the stairs, or the owl at the entry of the market, or the balcony  I paid 89,99 EUR, a fair price for a really nice set!! Greetings Sandra'
p686
aS"Thanks for the review, my favourite detail is the salad! :-D BTW, could you exchange the modules and make pics of that? I'd like to see how the building looks with the flat roof instead of the dutch style one"
p687
aS" I'm not sure though if the vents on the flat roof makes sense as long as it's only used as a garage top  "
p688
aS' :-/ Maybe they should be removable as the balconies and such things to make the modularity leading not to weird results  '
p689
aS' Other than this: In combination with a lot of money and the Cafe Corner set this really could get me into city! ;-)'
p690
aS" thanks for the great review! *sweet* now that i've seen the set, I'm afraid i'm a bit disappointed 8-| 1) the color combination doesn't really do it for me"
p691
aS" blue, dark blue, grey, black, tan, white, they're all mixed together without any over all design  "
p692
aS" 2) is there any interior? it doesn't look like it, and in any case, you can only reach it if you remove the modules    hm    |-/ now it looks too much of a box  "
p693
aS" 3) there are most certainly some nice ideas in this model and some great parts  the best part of the model is the staircase 4) i don't think he spent much time in thinking about the design"
p694
aS" As apo said, the chimneys on top of a garage is kinda weird, there's also a gate, next to another gate which is weird as well  "
p695
aS" also, if this is supposed to ba a grocery, then the owner has done a lot to hide it  The croissant is nice, but next to the brown box with vegies, there's nothing that suggests this is a shop  "
p696

p698
aS' Thanks, I love the look of this set! I love the mix of colours, it breaks up the model rather than being a single monotone colour'
p699
aS" He's used several complimentary colours in order to make up the model"
p700
aS" I agree I think the chimneys on the flat roof is weird ontop of the garage, but not so weird one you place it ontop of the building  I guess he's done it to give us the choice of roofs and chimneys"
p701
aS" You can always remove the ones you don't like    He also seems to have screwed up a bit on the tiling for the sidewalk on the side module"
p702
aS" On Cafe Corner (And the building module of this set) the sidewalk has the pattern light grey 1x6 at the front, then dark grey 1x2 next, then dark grey 2x2's"
p703
aS" However on this he's put the 2x2 tiles first then the 1x2's at the back  Easilly fixable though  Overall I love this set, thanks for the pics! Compliments Cafe Corner perfectly "

aS' When I got there, almost all the smaller Castle sets had been sold out, but there was one left: the one I am now reviewing for both Eurobricks and BZPower'
p929
aS' ;-) The Box: Well, for starters, the Castle theme boxes are beautiful! The blended clear and stormy skies give a great ?clash of the titans? effect, and the action poses help as well'
p930
aS' ;-) The back is equally nice, featuring a photo showing kids how to use the crossbow, and the brave axe wielder taking a swipe at the skeleton (foolish soldier, that won?t work on skellies! See later on in the review to find out why)'
p931
aS' And of course, we have a small box with the link to the official Lego website, where TLC can advertise even more Lego sets! :P The Contents: After opening the box, a single bag of pieces (with a couple loose ones), the instruction manual and necessary catalog ( :-P ), and a new wider rubber band holder spilt out'
p932
aS' The instruction manual is clear as a bell  No color trouble here, folks! Also, it?s worth mentioning the nice background with the mountain and King?s castle silhouettes'
p933
aS" :-) Sorry that there's no picture, but I'll take one if someone wants to see it  ;-) The Pieces: For being a 5 dollar set (well, seven in my case"
p934
aS' Darn your above average prices, TRU!), Crossbow Attack features a lot of nice pieces (as does the entire Castle lineup)'
p935
aS' Notable elements include two large brown spoked wheels, two brown modified 1x1?s, a pearl gold slope end, and SIX dark blue modified 1x1x2/3 slopes! The bulk of the pieces, however, are nothing special'
p936
aS' I?ll let the picture do the talking for this  The accessories are by far the best parts in this kit'
p937
aS' Two different helmets in a beautiful shiny silver are my favorite, but I also really like the scythe (looks good for MOCing) and the round shield ( *wub* ), which are both brand new parts'
p938
aS' And can anyone not love the classic axe and crossbows? Oh, and there?s a black lightsaber too, but that?s rather boring compared to the other parts'
p939
aS' :-P The Minifigures: Can you say, FOUR figures (including the horse)?! That has to be a record for a regular 5 dollar set, at least in the present age of limited figures per set'
p940
aS' We?ll start out with the two Crown militia: a regular soldier and an archer  Both have old faces, but they look spiffy with the shiny helmets and the superb torsos'
p941
aS' I?ll name the soldier Bravo the Stout and the archer Angler the Precise, for future references  Now we come to the skellie'
p942
aS' Although some people dislike the new skeleton design, I personally prefer it to the old ones, since the arms are now poseable and the face much meaner'
p943
aS' The only problem is that the arms hang too low, but it?s not too noticeable when they have weapons in their hands  And last, but not least, here?s the elusive skeleton horse'
p944
aS' I for one am very happy that TLC took advantage of that awesome prototype piece and made it into an official mass-production mold'
p945
aS' However, the horse is unfortunately one piece, but since regular Lego horses are as well, I don?t have a problem with it  I do have a problem with the pose, however'
p946
aS' The legs are in quite an odd position, and I wonder why TLC didn?t make the front and back leg poses symmetrical  Ah well  The Finished Set: I have only two pictures here, since this set is so small'
p947
aS' First, here?s the completed crossbow'
p948
aS' I must say: FINALLY! No more ridiculous horse mounted catapults or crazy fire wheel launchers! Now we have realistic siege weapons, including the one included with 7090'
p949
aS' Plus, it actually launches okay, although not the best  Here?s the other main attraction: the completed skeleton rider and horse'
p950
aS' I think it?s rather dramatic with that pose and the dark background, don?t you think? ;-) Playability: Okay, so there?s not much in this set, but a bit of imagination brings plenty of possibilities'
p951
aS' To show you what you can do, here?s a little story made only with this set'
p952
aS' ;-) Overall Rating: Presentation: 9/10 Pieces: 8/10 Minifigures: 9/10 Finished model: 8/10 Playability: 8/10 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Final Score: 8'
p953
aS'4/10 Crossbow Attack is a fine introduction into Castle, so I recommend it to any Lego fan, whether they are a castle nut or just want a cheap change of pace'
p954
aS' TLC has a knack with making great small kits these days, and I more than ever support them in their amazing rebound from their dark ages (between 1997 and 2004)'

p957
aS" They're sticking straight out, as opposed to every other fig, which have a slight bend to make them look more natural"
p958
aS" Also, as I'm sure you've noticed, the pegs are on angles! That makes it impossible for them to hold their weapons straight, and they can't even put their arms over their heads without stressing the plastic some"

aS'Here is a review of the new Monster Dino creator set with power functions First lets start with the box which is much larger than it needs to be!! It is one of the new style re-closeable boxes rather than the rip the sides style'
p1069
aS' This set is typical of creator and comes with three sets of instructions'
p1070
aS' The Monster Dino a kind of spider and a Crocodile The set comes with two of the new motors one small and one large, a sound module plus the new IR controler and receiver'
p1071
aS' There is a mix of techniques in this set the core is mainly studless technic, there are some studded technic parts and most of the details are standard creator style'
p1072
aS' There are two mechanisms one to control the legs and one to control the head and arms'
p1073
aS' The leg drive is from the large motor and the arm and head are operated from the small motor The completed mechanism will stand on its own without any detail added The detail is added to the base unit to complete the model'
p1074
aS' The operation of the Dino is very good the design for the motors and drives is very compact and well thought out'
p1075
aS' The walking motion works well although there is no steering and it will fall over it it encounters obstacles'
p1076
aS' The sound module is built into the head so when the mouth opens the Dino roars (sort of) Glyman made the comment that this set is ugly as sin and I tend to agree I think there are too many colour variations with different shades of grey, black and that lime green :-P which confuses the look of the finished model but I guess it might apeal more to younger kids'
p1077
aS' I also do not like the spikes along the back, which glow in the dark, because the are loose and keep falling off'
p1078
aS' This set is not cheap at ?70 but I guess this is because of the motors and IR controller'
p1079
aS' While on this I was surprised how good the range was on the new controller it would still operate ever when not in direct line of sight'
p1080
aS' I would give this set a 10/10 for playabilityit has kept the kid amused for hours I would give it 6/10 for value for money it is a bit pricey Overall 8/10 It took approx 3 hours to build and has been well played with I have posted some more images and some videos of the finished models on my brickshelf page HERE If you have any questions please ask Pete Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 06:28 PM'

p1137
aS'   a way too long time This is my first new space themed set since more than 20 years and I must say that Im not disappointed at all  I have much to say about this little gem'
p1138
aS' First, lets cut it straight about the Martians minifigures: they are absolutely rubbish  I cant imagine how Lego could produce such atrocity  This said; lets move on to the dropship'
p1139
aS' A real piece of art  Reminiscent of the Aliens movie dropship'
p1140
aS' The cockpit is spacious and provides a great field of view, too bad there is no hinges to open it, you must remove the canopy completely to switch pilot'
p1141
aS' The drilling unit can be attached under the ship with the clever use of a rubber piece  It stays well in place once attached, good point'
p1142
aS' Some people dont like the inclusion of the 2 containment area for the Martians and crystal on both side of the ship but I kind like it, it makes the ship less empty'
p1143
aS' The 2 wings are complete with air intake, some armaments and 1 standard launcher on the right wing  Normally I dont like launchers but this one is very discrete and well integrated'
p1144
aS' On the tail section are 2 thrusters that can be rotated and provide thus some realistic movements to the ship'
p1145
aS' One of the last highlight of this ship is the landing gears, or I must say landing dishes  6 medium sized radar dishes provide and incredible stability to the set'
p1146
aS' They are quite sturdy and can take a beating  Im not going to review the alien spaceship in detail since its quite uninteresting'
p1147
aS' I consider it more like a bonus addition to the set than anything else  The look is passable and there are some interesting building techniques in it  Thats all'

p1187
tp1188
Rp1189
aS" The dropships looks neat, and your review is good  It isn't my theme, but it clearly is a fantastic set for the space lovers under us"
p1190
aS' Mars Mission is really a good step in the right direction for TLC '
p1191
aS' Of course, right before I post this I see that Ickelpete reviewed this set earlier in the week'
p1192
aS' Sorry for being redundant but it is already written so here ya go: Monster Dino Reviewed by Dunamis Set 4958 792 Pieces $89 95 from LEGO Online Store Build time 3'
p1193
aS'5 hours Here we go with another offering from the Creator line  I?m kind of fond of these sets as they are pretty imaginative and usually have instructions for multiple models'
p1194
aS' I like the reusability of all the pieces and the varied things you can build'
p1195
aS' The Box: The box that LEGO shipped this thing in was absolutely huge! When I first got this in the mail, I thought I had won the lottery and they had shipped the UCS Falcon early'
p1196
aS' Once I opened the shipping box, I was surprised to see an unusually large Creator set box'
p1197
aS' The box itself is pretty standard Creator type box but this one shows off the Power Functions prominently on the right side of the box'
p1198
aS' The back of the box shows some of the motorized features as well  Opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals'
p1199
aS' We?re back to the reusable cereal box type tab system for those of you who stay up a night wondering about LEGO?s next box design  Inside the box we have a bunch of sealed bags'
p1200
aS' Immediately the power brick, remote and motors stand out as they are each in individual bags  Also, there are three manuals  The Manuals: The three manuals are 76, 76 and 56 pages in length'
p1201
aS' They are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings: - Piece call outs for each step - Parts inventory at the end of the primary model build - Page numbers Color separation in these manuals were fine for me'
p1202
aS' Interestingly, the instructions for the primary build took a full manual plus about a quarter of another manual'
p1203
aS' Random manual photos: Parts list I?ll explain a bit more below, but it would have been nice to have some written documentation on all the functions of the motors, remote and receiver'
p1204
aS' Such as motor load guidelines and specific explanations of all the remote control functions  It is severely lacking in this area'
p1205
aS' The Pieces: Obviously, the pieces we?re most interested in are these new motors and wireless remote control  Note that before you fire this bad boy up, you had better BYOB'
p1206
aS' Since this is prominently a European community, I had better clarify my acronyms  Over here across the pond, BYOB usually means ?Bring Your Own Beer?'
p1207
aS' In this case, it still means bring your own beer (I?m on my second Heineken right now) but in addition to numerous bottles of beer you will need a total of NINE batteries to get through this set'
p1208
aS' I kid you not: Anyway, there are two motors (a small and a large) each with its own very unique name according to the manual; the smaller one is called ?motor? and the larger one is called ?XL motor?'
p1209
aS' Very creative indeed! The battery box takes SIX AA batteries and there are two compartments to hold them  Here is the first: That seems pretty normal'
p1210
aS' However, the back side of it holds the other three batteries and it seems to be very poorly designed: Note in the photo above where the bottom battery is placed'
p1211
aS' Compare it to the previous photo and you will see the difference'
p1212
aS' I played around with trying to get that bottom battery out and you better pack a lunch (or BYOB) because it is no small task! Why couldn?t they make this compartment just like the other side? There is a single power cord connector and a three position switch'
p1213
aS' The middle position turns the power OFF and the other two positions seem to provide the same functionality in either position as far as I can tell'
p1214
aS' Perhaps a little blurb in the manual would have been nice to clear things up a bit  The remote takes three AAA batteries  It is fairly small and lightweight even with the batteries installed'
p1215
aS' It has two thumb controls which could be levers if you insert Technic bars or even pins  The two controls are color coded and match the plugs on the receiver to control two separate motors'
p1216
aS' In addition, there is a four position switch which I assume changes the channel  Finally, there are two tiny levers that seem to have no function'
p1217
aS' I?m not sure if they are a trim control or variable speed control  I messed with them and didn?t notice any difference in the motor speed'
p1218
aS' Again, some documentation from the incredibly verbose LEGO manual would have helped  As far as the rest of the parts, it?s really a mixed bag'
p1219
aS' There are a lot of varied parts in this set to the point that there is almost one of everything  Lots of Technic gears, pins, studded beams, studless beams, axles, wheels, etc'
p1220
aS' Also, lots of little 1x1 slopes in various colors, teeth, horns, etc  You can?t really say it is a parts pack because there is not enough of one thing to make it a parts pack'
p1221
aS' A couple of notes: It seems the quality control issue on the axles has been fixed  I initially reported this back when I reviewed the 8285 about a year ago  All the axles worked fine for me'
p1222
aS' The color quality control issue is still alive  Check out the different shade of red in these two parts: Also included is the sound brick'
p1223
aS' This looks just like the other sound or light-up bricks we have been seeing lately'
p1224
aS' It does have a load dinosaur ?roar!? sound embedded in it though so hide the younglings if they are a bit on the skittish side'
p1225
aS' Finally, I?ve never seen one of these before (although someone will no doubt rattle off a dozen sets where you can find this part in about 5 seconds): No, I am not referring to the studded beam, I put that in the photo for scale'
p1226
aS' The Build: The build was fun and was fairly straightforward  As I mentioned, there is a lot of Technic parts, so if you are not a fan of the Technic line you should run, not walk away from this one'
p1227
aS' There were no gotchas to speak of, but you need to pay careful attention to the placement of the wires that go from the motors to the receiver  They kind of sneak them around a bit so watch closely'
p1228
aS' Otherwise, it was fine  Here is what is left over: So far, I have only built the primary model  As seen on the box, there are instructions for two more models'
p1229
aS' Both of the other models seem less complex than the primary model and are likely quicker builds  The Dino took me about 3 5 hours which included some time to screw around with the motors'
p1230
aS' I?m an old school Technic fan from way back in the 80?s so I had some familiarity with the old Technic motors  Obviously, 25+ years has improved some things and these seem much more powerful'
p1231
aS' The Design: If you have built the 4507 Prehistoric Creatures then some of the design will feel familiar, especially the head and tail'
p1232
aS' It is almost like they took the dinosaur from that set and figured out how to motorize it  This is not necessarily a bad thing, just a comment'
p1233
aS' The set does a good job of showing off the features of the new motors and remote  It is nice to see how one motor can perform multiple functions'
p1234
aS' In this case, the small motor makes both arms move and opens and closes the mouth of the dinosaur'
p1235
aS' When the mouth is completely open, it pushes the activation switch on the sound brick which emits the ?roar!? sound  Pretty cool  The ?XL Motor? handles the walking feature of the dinosaur'
p1236
aS' There is both forward and reverse  Forward works really well while the reverse just makes the dinosaur look like he is doing a Michael Jackson moon walk'
p1237
aS' (Wow, I never thought I would use Michael Jackson?s name in a LEGO Dinosaur set review!) It is almost like the dinosaur can?t get traction going in reverse'
p1238
aS' However, as noted previously forward works really well  This guy actually gets going at a pretty good clip'
p1239
aS' As you might expect, he kind of waddles like a duck since there is no articulation in the knees  It is a bit awkward but it works  The ?XL Motor? seems to kick out plenty of power'
p1240
aS' Overall, the design seems to be a mixed bag  The way the tail is attached seems to be an afterthought  The arms look to be too small'
p1241
aS' However, the walking mechanism and legs/feet are pretty cool as well as the head and mouth'
p1242
aS' I guess it is a reasonable effort to get people introduced to the parts and we?ll see designs improve as time goes on'
p1243
aS' Here are a few views of our new friend: But What About The AT-AT??? Of course, the real reason you are reading this is that you hope I will have some epiphany on how all this relates to the new walking AT-AT'
p1244
aS' Judging from the box on the AT-AT, it looks like we get one motor'
p1245
aS' I don?t see the remote which is a disappointment as I hope it is not controlled by a switch on the body and you either turn the AT-AT on or off'
p1246
aS' If that is the case, the first thing I am doing is scavenging the receiver and remote from this set to add to the AT-AT'
p1247
aS' Granted, it could be that it comes with a remote but is just not seen on the box  Also, the AT-AT box looks like one of the images shows that the head turns'
p1248
aS' I sure hope this is controlled separately as it would be really lame to not be able to control this independently from the walking feature  I?m kind of skeptical on the walking feature of the AT-AT'
p1249
aS' I suspect it will be rather cumbersome but hopefully I will be pleasantly surprised  Needless to say, this is all speculation but those are my initial thoughts based on this set'
p1250
aS' Overall Thoughts: It?s an OK set  Kind of pricy but I suspect a large part of that is due to the motors and remote'
p1251
aS' I haven?t built the other two models (they seem less interesting to me) but at least it has some variability'
p1252
aS' Also, you get a ton of different parts which can either be a good thing or bad thing depending on what you are looking for  The dinosaur is average'
p1253
aS' The color selection is marginal (black and lime green?) and the tail section is just lame  I appreciate it more for the mechanical functions and how the motorized parts work'
p1254
aS' It does do a good job of waking up my dog who seems pretty irritated by it'
p1255
aS' It is a nice set to show off to the neighbors or the endless caravan of my wife?s friends that seem to materialize out of nowhere'
p1256
aS' People are quickly impressed by it and then promptly move along once you start trying to explain how it all works'
p1257
aS' I?m a bit disappointed that the manual did not explain more about the remote and motor functions  I suspect that there is more than meets the eye and I?ll just have to play around with it to find out'
p1258
aS' It would be nice if LEGO had a website that showed all the cool functions of the motors and remotes so we fully understand the capabilities  Final Rating: 72% Build 9/10 (Pretty quick and fun'
p1259
aS' The mechanical part is cool) Functionality 6/10 (It is a Creator set so you have multiple builds  As far as it being a dinosaur, it?s just OK  Motorized parts are cool though'
p1260
aS') Design 6/10 (Partly cloudy  Some things are cool, others are lame ) Parts 8/10 (New motors and remote are cool  Lots of varied parts included but nothing to write home about'
p1261
aS') Price 7/10 (It is kind of expensive) Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 06:23 PM  Indexed'

I have two questions: - What is the driver standing on, when the hatch is open and he is looking out? - Could you show the face of Kallus without helmet, please? My only complaint is that the colours of both, Kallus's and the drivers's uniforms are wrong"

aS' Nice Review *y* I have quick question though   '
p1690
aS" Do the crystals fit into the aliens hands? Try and stick one in there,Becuase the new catalog shows an image of an alien holding a crystal Lastly lego should have made the aliens with movable arms and no hole in the middle |-/ I don't want to waste any money so I am only going to grab 1 or 2 of the smaller sets Piranha EDIT:IMO the aliens would win becuase they have superior technology and all they do is have to cut the airtank line and the humans die Edited by Piranha, 20 July 2007 - 01:40 AM"
p1691
aS" Yes, they can hold the crystals  They can't move the hands ( |-/ ) but they do have the clawlike hand of the droid arm"

aS" Lego 41062 Elsa's Sparkling Ice Castle Lego managed to get a Frozen licensed set in the new wave of Disney Princess sets  However, I'm VERY surprised by the size"
p1720
aS' It\'s a $40 set and comes in a small Friends-style box (roughly 12"x12" size) - I almost didn\'t see it on the shelf when I was looking for it because it\'s so small'
p1721
aS" I mean, I know it's only $40 but it's a friggin' CASTLE  And why did Lego only make this a smaller set? If they'd made a $200 Frozen castle they still would have sold every one they could produce"
p1722
aS' They made big Harry Potter Hogwarts sets and those sure sold  And have you SEEN the toys in the Frozen section of stores? HUGE playsets for Barbie-sized dolls'
p1723
aS" But I suppose I'm getting the cart before the horse here, reviewing before I've even opened the box  So      Name: Elsa's Sparkling Ice Castle Set Number: 41062 Pieces: 292 Price: $39"
p1724
aS'99 Minifigs: 3 Theme: Disney Princess Year of Release: 2015 Links: Bricklink Peeron Brickset The Box The front of the box is standard Lego fare, other than the large Anna and Elsa in the bottom right corner'
p1725
aS' Oh, and surprisingly, nowhere on the box is the normal minifig lineup  The only way to know what characters are included is to look at the set pictures'
p1726
aS" The 1:1 This set uses one of the minidolls as the actual size sample  That's probably not a bad choice since the minidolls are not nearly as well known as a minifig"
p1727
aS' The Back On the back, the play features are shown in insets around a rear view of the castle  Like Friends sets, you also have an array of play accessories'
p1728
aS" The Seals Is this standard on 2015 sets or is this specific to this set? I've never seen 3 tape seals on a set"
p1729
aS' Even huge modulars or Technic sets only have 2, so 3 on a set this small seems excessive'
p1730
aS" Perhaps Lego expects people to try to steal the dolls? If so, why bother with extra tape? A tiny pocketknife makes quick work of the tape so the third strip doesn't even slow you down"
p1731
aS" The Contents In the box are 2 instruction booklets (bent), a white plate, a sticker sheet, and 3 numbered bags of parts  The Stickers These are very hard to photograph since they're shiny"
p1732
aS' I mean polished chrome shiny  Those dark lines across the corners are not really there, they\'re reflections of my ceiling  The Manual Backs The back of one booklet has a Friends "Win!" girl'
p1733
aS" The other has an ad for the Lego Disney Princess website  That site is SO girly there's even sparkles following your mouse cursor around  So I didn't stay too long or look too deeply"
p1734
aS" The Sample Page The interior pages of the manuals are on lavender backgrounds  It's standard Lego instructions with part callouts and insets when needed"
p1735
aS" The Build, 1 The first thing you build is Anna, but I'm not showing that yet  Then you build this little picnic scene"
p1736
aS' It\'s tiny but effective, and nice to have something not icy in the set since the movie has the "In Summer" song for Olaf'
p1737
aS" I'm curious what's in that sandwich though - green and pink? After the picnic is the Olaf build, but I'll save him for later too  The Build, 2 Next is this small sleigh"
p1738
aS' It has an amazing amount of style for something so small  The curved front and decorative whips on the back make it look sleigh-like instead of blocky'
p1739
aS" But come on, it already had pink accents, are the pink flowers really necessary? Technically, yes, so the whips can mount to them, but still, it's just over-girly for my taste"
p1740
aS' The Build, 3 The sleigh needs a ramp to help it rocket along (for a couple inches, at least)  The ramp starts like this, with a hidden lime green jumper plate that gets a cookie on it'
p1741
aS" I couldn't remember anything in the movie like that, so I asked my wife and she couldn't either"
p1742
aS' A hidden cookie under a hill? The Build, 4 After putting the tilting 2x8 onto the base and adding decorations, this is the result'
p1743
aS' A lime green bucket holding a pair of ice skates, a flower (in the snow, really?), green and white round studs that I assume are supposed to be grass and snow? The Build, 5 The sleigh looks huge sitting on top of the tiny hill, but it actually works pretty well'
p1744
aS" Assuming you're on a smooth surface like a table, you can give the sleigh a little nudge and it'll shoot down the ramp and a few inches across the table"
p1745
aS" The unevenness of the slopes vs the blue tiles holds the sleigh in line well, and the bumps in the slopes don't seem to hamper anything  The Build, 6 Moving on to bag 2   "
p1746
aS" man that's a lot of colors in this base already  And I'm already starting to feel like there's trans-blue cheese thrown around randomly"
p1747
aS" The Build, 7 Continuing (and rotating), some steps and even more colors thrown in  Magenta? In Elsa's ice palace? I sure don't remember any of that  "
p1748
aS" The Build, 8 Wait, seriously? An ice cream stand in the castle? That is what the magenta is for? I kinda actually like the looks of it, but it doesn't fit the set"
p1749
aS" The Build, 9 Spinning back around, now there's a light aqua spiral staircase added along with a roof  This is where I'm really starting to wonder about Lego's thinking"
p1750
aS" Those light aqua stairs, and the light aqua 1x4 tiles, are exclusive to this set (as far as I know    it's possible some other 2015 sets use them, but nothing in Bricklink yet)"
p1751
aS" Seems expensive (to produce) to me, when there's no huge reason to need them  Another blue for the tiles would have been fine"
p1752
aS" And the spiral stairs? Really? Elsa's castle is KNOWN for staircases, but NOT spiral ones! There should be a huge straight ice stairway out front or sweeping curved stairs inside, but not a spiral"
p1753
aS" The Build, 10 And now we finish the tree  Again, why? Where is there a tree next to Elsa's castle? And so weird    with ice hanging from green branches that have both snow and flowers on them"
p1754
aS' Huh? Did Lego watch a different movie? The Trans-Light Blue Bits Before looking at the upper level, a brief pause to look at some other parts'
p1755
aS" Here's the 1x2x5 brick in trans-light blue and the 2x4x6 rock panel in glitter trans-light blue  Do those look like the same blue to you? And again, ANOTHER unique part for this set"
p1756
aS' Why do those rock panels need to be glitter, when Lego made the same panel in trans light blue in 2013 and 2014 for SuperHeroes, Friends, and Chima sets? Apparently Disney REALLY wanted glitter, because there are a bunch of trans-glitter parts in the new Princess sets'
p1757
aS" There's trans-neon green cones for Jasmine; Ariel, Jasmine, and Sleeping Beauty all get glitter trans purple cones  So there's a bunch of new glitter parts for 2015"
p1758
aS' The Build, 11 Back to building - time to add the upper level  We get a bedroom with a decent bed, although stickered  The Build, 12 The other side of the bedroom has some little accessories'
p1759
aS' Perfume and a crown I assume? The Build, 13 Time for walls and a roof'
p1760
aS" I like the small white macaroni bricks for a wall, but what's with the lavender fence piece in the center? I'll grant that it looks nice (a common white fence would have been a little boring), but it's ANOTHER unique piece to this set"
p1761
aS' The Build, 14 The very top of the castle is built separately'
p1762
aS' Not a whole lot to say here other than why is there a torch in an ICE CASTLE? The Finished Castle Once the roof is put on, the castle is done'
p1763
aS" And that big purple star on top says everything to me about the styling  It just doesn't look like modern Lego to me; it looks like this should be an old Belville fairy tale set from around 1999"
p1764
aS" If I saw a photo of just the castle with no figs (or picnic blanket), I'd assume that's what it was  The Oops, Not Actually Done Yet Accessories At the end, there's a few bits left to add"
p1765
aS" There are these dark purple skis (yup, another unique part) in the lower level  Let me tell you, they're a pain to get into that location, at least with my big man hands"
p1766
aS' More Accessories The top level gets a stickered book  The sticker has a nice castle image on it that is, while not quite exactly the castle from Disney World, VERY Disney-looking'
p1767
aS" I actually had to google and see if that's the castle they use in their logo  Nope, but it's the same style  The Leftovers There are a LOT of extra parts in this"
p1768
aS" That's almost 10% of the part count in the set right there! They are pretty useful overall though"
p1769
aS' It\'s great to have an extra "carrot" and brown "branch" for Olaf, since you know those will get lost as he\'s played with  The Figs Finally, the reason for the set'
p1770
aS" Let's face it, the castle set is just an excuse to make these figures  And they're GREAT  I mean just fantastic  The print on them is just such a good match to the real characters"
p1771
aS" Compare to the cartoon version from the front of the box  Elsa's hair is a little darker than the cartoon, but overall these are just dead on"
p1772
aS' If I had to pick out a flaw, it\'s the "spell" Elsa is holding  It\'s too bad she can only shoot it forward with her arm down like that'
p1773
aS" It'd be nice to have the end of the splash part bent 90 degrees so she can have her arm forward and the spell shooting forward too  Oh, one other thing"
p1774
aS" The minidoll heads don't press down tight to the body like minifig heads do  There's still exposed neck  It looks nice, but it means Elsa's cape can swing around"
p1775
aS" The Fig Backs Elsa's cape is glittery on the back and you can see the removable bow in her hair  The Full Set One final issue"
p1776
aS" When you put Anna on the sleigh, her cape doesn't have enough flexibility (since it's a wraparound kind) and so it folds out funny"
p1777
aS" That's why on the back of the box it shows her standing on the back of the sleigh with Elsa in the seat"
p1778
aS" Edit: How on earth did I forget to comment on those orange flowers to each side of the castle? I'm pretty sure Elsa did NOT have any flowers blooming outside her castle! The Conclusion Hm"
p1779
aS" I really wanted to like this set, but I just can't quite bring myself to"
p1780
aS" It feels like Lego pulled a random castle design from the files then redid it into white and trans blue to look icy and allow a Frozen tie in set  The figs are great, but the castle isn't"
p1781
aS' I guess the real castle in the movie would be a boring set and this one has play features, but it just is too different for my taste'
p1782
aS" The Ratings Value: 7/10 - $40 for less than 300 parts is high (especially when so many of the parts are tiny, but on the other hand there's a LOT of rock panels and 1x2x5 trans blue panels), but the figs help save it"
p1783
aS" Design: 4/10 - Not one of Lego's best  Not as bad as the lows in the 90s, but not a great set  Minifigs: 10/10 - Possibly even a 12/10  They ARE the reason to buy the set "
p1784
aS' Playability: 8/10 - There are a bunch of play features, but they actually detract from the design, so I had to knock off a couple points'
p1785
aS' Parts: 7/10 - A bunch of impractical unique parts (how often do you need dark purple skis or a lavender fence piece?) but also a bunch of nice parts if you wanted to make your own icy scene'
p1786
aS" Overall: 7/10 - A great bunch of figs, but I'd recommend not bothering with the manuals  Just use the parts to build your own castle that's better "
p1787
aS" Two of my daughters are building this as we speak  I agree the design is a lot smaller than I would have liked, but they're loving it  No question the figures are the real draw here"
p1788
aS" And at 6 and almost five years old they're doimg a good job building so far  At least for the 4-6 range in my house, this set is a home run  Thanks for the great review, Mostlytechnic!"

p1814
aS' Thanks for the review! I have the same opinion about the design, looks like Belville  I bought it on Legostore Orlando December 30th  It was impressive'
p1815
aS' My wife saw them putting on shelf, 8 or 10 boxes  She ran and grabbed the last one! The girls faces around it was indescribable, mix of ecstasy and afraid to loose it'
p1816
aS" It happened in less than 2 minutes  My 7 yo girl didn't want it  She likes the dresses but hates the movie  Prefers Lego Movie"
p1817
aS' But my 2 yo girl who never saw the movie grabbed it for good, and we bought it  Lego will sell it like water, but I do not understand why a set so small'
p1818
aS' It is the WORST SET DESIGN since the introduction of Lego Friends  My 7 yo has more than 50 Lego friends minifigures, all the Lego fiends stores and concluded that the castle had a terrible design'
p1819
aS" She is 7!! Let's be honest, Lego should have released this sets months before this Christmas and is loosing a perfect opportunity to sell a decent set, with much more pieces"
p1820
aS' I am wondering if they are going to make another set with the same characters  At the end,  It is just for the minifigures '
p1821
aS" When I first saw the pictures, I didn't realize that this set had so much color barf going on in it  Also, there is a bunch of stuff that does not fit in with the movie, and it is pricey"
p1822
aS' The minifigures are nice, but no Kristoff or Sven  I thought about getting this, but this review is pushing me towards no '
p1823
aS' Yep, my family all thinks they should have made a bigger set, added figs, and just been printing money  This feels massively rushed into production'
p1824
aS' Which is weird, the other princess sets that just came out look worlds better '
p1825
aS" I wish Elsa had more of a white hairpiece rather than blonde  But it could be worse  Not a bad set overall, although Olaf doesn't look right without the twigs on his head"
p1826
aS' Anna is a really nice and accurate fig '
p1827
aS" The review is very well done  Thanks! I don't know the movie  My key question is whether the bricks in the set will allow to build my own snow/ice creations"
p1828
aS' Now, with "trans-glitter" being part of the design approach I am not so sure'
p1829
aS' Can those who have already bought it tell me: can trans-glitter be used as "transparent with snow particles" or is it just terrible? I cannot really tell from the review pic above '
p1830
aS" I think the trans-glitter blue panels can be icy or snowy just fine  I'm sure that's WHY they used them for this set"
p1831
aS" Now, if you're looking for realism (like the photos in your sig seem to be), it might be tougher  But I've been thinking about using those big glittery panels to make a waterfall-type scene "
p1832
aS" I'm literally of the exact opposite opinion to OP here  I love the structure and the parts (this is a fantastic little parts pack that I'll be snagging more of when I find it again)  "

p1904
aS' It will be pretty comprehensive since the finished built will be quick and will be focusing more of what kind of fun that you can derive from there'
p1905
aS' This polybag was bought in September 2013, when I visited LEGOLAND Malaysia and I did not hesitate to put this in my shopping basket'
p1906
aS' Name: 30253 Leonidas Jungle Dragster Theme: LEGO System / Legends of Chima Year: 2013 Pieces: 30 Minifigs: 1 minifigure Price: USD N A, GBP N A, EURO N A, SGD N'
p1907
aS'A Resources: Brickset, BrickLink An original polybag image of the 30253 Leonidas Jungle Dragster Back view of the original polybag image of the 30253 Leonidas Jungle Dragster The road scout of the Lions Tribe This polybag design is definitely plan to be the quickest and fastest dragster to recce enemy front by making a swift scout for the Lions Tribe'
p1908
aS' I believe by the sound of the name, Jungle Dragster, it might just be suitable to use in jungle terrain'
p1909
aS" Well, I don't quite agree that this is a 'Dragster' even though it has the kind of open view concept of rolling in fast but it does not have the length of a typical dragster, similar to this Town polybag design, for example"
p1910
aS' Still, it is nice to have smaller variants of their vehicular supremacy'
p1911
aS' Instruction Manual (Front) Instruction Manual (Back) The LEGO building content With just 30 LEGO elements, you can be pretty quick to be able to display these laid out content'
p1912
aS' After the built is completed, these are the remaining spare parts  I am fond of the wheels which are some useful parts, other than that, there are nothing spectacular about it'
p1913
aS' My name is Leonidas and I belonged to the Lions Tribe Do not be mistaken of his name, Leonidas to be the King of Sparta who led the brave men of 300 Spartans Warriors to fight to the death against the Persians'
p1914
aS' Instead this character is based on the bio resided in LEGO com, you will realise that he is aligned with the Lions tribe and is a proud Lion foot-soldier'
p1915
aS' He may have that goofy idiotic look but he can be very serious in his commitment to discharging his duties  You are able to observe his nice back view printing which reveal his black and blue sash'
p1916
aS' Leonidas has a dual facial feature to reveal his much serious appearance  Leonidas is one of the common characters available in the Legends of Chima universe  It can be found in a total of five sets'
p1917
aS' It is a great pity that there is no weapon being made for him in this polybag design which will certainly make a fine addition'
p1918
aS' The completed built of the Jungle Dragster This is the main design of the Jungle Dragster which is very simple looking'
p1919
aS' There is no distinct fighting capability from the vehicular design and it look just like a regular patrol vehicle  One thing I like about this, is the close distinct colour schema of the Lions Tribe'
p1920
aS' Other than that, there is nothing special about it'
p1921
aS' Moving off with my Jungle Dragster To conclude, this polybag is really meant for LEGO fans or collectors who appreciate Legends of Chima or wanting to sample the Legends of Chima theme'
p1922
aS' It is a very simple built, but yet could form a decent force size for recce purposes before sending in the big arsenals to whack their enemies'
p1923
aS' Either way, I will only suggest you to buy it if you really love this theme at an inexpensive price  Otherwise, it is perfectly alright to give this a miss'
p1924
aS' Summary review Playability: 4/10 (You need to have more Lions Tribe vehicles in order to bring the best and fun out of it since this is more of a supporting vehicle'
p1925
aS') Design: 4/10 (Simplistic built of the dragster and main focus is just acquiring the minifigure'
p1926
aS') Price: 4/10 (Bought at about USD$7, which is not an awesome price, so get it if you can get it more than half of this price'
p1927
aS') Overall: 4/10 (If only you are a huge mega fan of the Legends of Chima, then you need to get this ) I gave it a "2" based on my Review Score Card'

p2065
aS" The officer and pilot look cool with their dark blue trousers  A new R2 unit as well  Don't remeber this in the film, but great to have one in a new colour"
p2066
aS" *wub* Back of the box shows some of the ship's nifty features  First thing you notice when you open the box, is the awesome selection of bricks  This makes a for a great parts pack"
p2067
aS" Loads of unusual red and dark red pieces  It's so refreshing to see a Star Wars set that isn't predominantly grey  There are also two instruction booklets"
p2068
aS" As soon as you open the first booklet you hit an error  Why would I want two Obi-Wans? :-| It's also at this point that you come across a big disappointment  On the box you get a flesh Qui-Gon"
p2069
aS' What is actually in the box is an EpIII Obi-Wan  Come on LEGO - why change it? |-/ All the figures look impressive in the flesh despite the BIG mistake  Once I started the build it progressed rapidly'
p2070
aS' Red pieces seem to be a lot easier to find  Lots of clever techniques  Quite a few Technic elements get used at the start  It reminded me of building a Technic set from the 80s at times'
p2071
aS' Here is the main body half way through the build  The landing mechanism is a nice touch  Its not fully retractable, but still folds away nicely'
p2072
aS" You find the ship keeps tipping over as you build it despite the feet, as it's only at the end thay it all becomes evenly balanced at both ends  Here the feet are extended"
p2073
aS' You can also see the yellow knob that rotates the radar on top of the ship  Landing gear up viewed from the front  Here are the radar  A great collection of dishes'
p2074
aS' They spin easily with little friction  Here is the ship at the half way point  The front works well with the top flipping up to squeeze in the pilot  More to come    :-)'

aS' 7665 Review Part 2 The second half of the build goes quicker than the first  Once you start to add the engines, the ship really begins to take shape'
p2099
aS' The main body of the ship has a few surprises hidden away under a removable cover  Inside you get some retracting guns, a storage box, a little shuttle and space for a droid and figure'
p2100
aS' Here is everything you can fit inside  The guns are concealed behind the side vents  Pushing them forward causes the vents to open'
p2101
aS' Closed: And open: The final feature is the passenger area/escape pod  Inside is plenty of space for two figures'
p2102
aS' The pod cleverly attaches by pushing the front section of the ship forward, sliding the pod in, then returning the front  Everything locks together and is held securely in place by an elastic band'
p2103
aS" :-) Here's a couple of pictures of the final model  It's not the most beautiful creation ever, but it is an excellent representation of the ship from the film"
p2104
aS" The angular shape actually suits a LEGO build well  There's one more useful feature  The whole ship can be safely and comfortably picked up by two ball ended Technic pins towards the back end"
p2105
aS" It balances well at this point and does allow you to swoosh the ship around much more easily  This was the most enjoyable Star Wars build I've had in a long time"
p2106
aS" Everything progresses nicely with almost no repetitive bits  The ship looks good and is also HUGE! *sweet* Compare it to the 6211 ISD and you'll see it's only fractionally smaller"
p2107
aS" When I first saw pictures of this on the internet I thought it looked OK  Once you see it for real it is much more impressive  For ?69 99 in the UK I'm not complaining"
p2108
aS" It's the best value Star Wars set of the year so far"
p2109
aS' To conclude: Pieces: 9/10 Minifigures: 7/10 (would be a 9 apart from the stupid Qui-Gon/Obi-Wan head error) Playability: 8/10 Originality: 9/10 Set Design: 8/10 Overall: 8'

The escape shuttle looks roamy enough, a bit dull though but it could have a PS III stached away somewhere, but the other shuttle :-| - come on!

aS' Mine was rather wrinkled in the box and it does not hang very well  I do like the pattern/design: And the last image of the ship, the top of the cabin removed'
p2282
aS' This is a great playability feature: ----------------------- ON TO THE CASTLE ----------------------- The front'
p2283
aS' It is built with three sections: 1) middle bridge section, 2) right building structure, 3) left catapult cave: Starting with the building section: The roof lifts to reveal my favorite part of the castle'
p2284
aS' It includes a small table, chicken/turkey leg, barrel, short sword, and gold goblet: The catapult cave section  The catapult rotates 360 degrees'
p2285
aS' The chest contains three colored gems: The back side: The bridge (middle section): A sliding mechanism pulls out allowing four brown tiles to collapse when pulling'
p2286
aS' More planks would have made the feature better (kind of like the Tygura Adventurers set): The middle section'
p2287
aS' I love the knight shield: A closer perspective: The back of the middle section: The knights  No new torsos, faces, or weapons: The skeletons'
p2288
aS" I really like the skeleton captain with beard and pirate hat: And lastly, the set includes two new silver orbs (for the catapult), and two projectiles for the ship's gun: ------------ SUMMARY ------------ LIKES: I like the combination of the skeleton ship and castle wall"
p2289
aS' I regret taking apart my castle to see how this new castle section could have been added'
p2290
aS' The set offers much playability with seven figs, accessible structures, and detailed accessories (two chests, crate, goblet, gold, gems, and barrel)'
p2291
aS" Most of all, I like the thought of a castle on the sea with the doc  DISLIKES: Right after opening the box, I found the ship's sail rolled up and wrinkled  This is very disappointing"
p2292
aS" I may write Lego and ask for a replacement  I'm not sure if these can be ironed or flattened some how  In addition, lately all my set instructions have been badly wrinkled"
p2293
aS' Lego needs to pack these in boxes better o that they stay flat  Perhaps the paper is a little thinner too adding to the issue'
p2294
aS' The ship could have been longer with a molded back end (as mentioned above), but it still looks pretty good'
p2295
aS' I would prefer a smaller closed castle structure as opposed to a wall, but the sections that can be disattached are nice (esp  the building structure)'
p2296
aS" I think the price is a little too much for the # of pieces (many small), and the box way too large  It really isn't much after building the set"
p2297
aS' ------------------- FINAL THOUGHT ------------------- This is probably the better of most of the new Castle theme sets but it is still a bit like Knights Kingdom'
p2298
aS' I would buy this set again for the likes mentioned above'
p2299
aS" I'm not sure how I plan to use this set as I don't want to rebuild the large castle any time soon, but it is a nice stand alone set with a lot of playability  Hope you enjoy the review "

aS' REVIEW - 42039 - 24 HOURS RACE CAR INTRODUCTION When the preliminary images of the "Le Mans Racer" surfaced somewhere last year (2014) it got a lot of praise'
p2596
aS' This changed dramatically when the final images of the 24 Hours Race Car showed up  The front side of the car, especially the head lights, and the curvature of the side of car had changed a lot'
p2597
aS' The car obviously still resembled the prototype, but the new design raised a lot of eyebrows  The new design was considered a step back instead of forward'
p2598
aS' Eventhough I still liked the design, I must admit I liked the earlier design better too  With the emphasis on past tense liked  I am not sure anymore and this review will show you why'
p2599
aS" Like the Arctic Truck this set has a B-model which is well worth checking out  That's why this review includes both the A-model and B-model"
p2600
aS" For people who are on the fence, the B-model might actually convince them to buy the set after all  Let's see what this set is all about! Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions"
p2601
aS' SET INFORMATION Number: 42039 Title: 24 Hours Race Car Theme: Technic Released: 2015 Part Count: 1219 Box Weight: 2110 gr Box Dimensions: 47,8 cm x 37,3 cm x 8,7 cm Model Dimensions: 40 cm x 18 cm Set Price (MSRP): 99'
p2602
aS'99 / $? / 99 99 Price per Part: 0 082 / $? / 0 082 Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX The box measures 47,8 cm x 37,3 cm x 8,7 cm and weighs well over 2kg (2110 gr to be precise)'
p2603
aS" The width of the box is the same as the box of the Arctic Truck  This box also feels like it's filled to the brim"
p2604
aS' THE FRONT The front shows a picture of the main model in action, with radial blurred wheels to emphasize the motion of the car  The lower right section shows the dimensions of the model'
p2605
aS' Upon completion, it will measure a length of 40cm and a width of 18 cm  THE BACK Like the front, the back side has exactly the same setup as the box of the Arctic Truck'
p2606
aS' The top shows the functions of the model, while the lower left side shows the B-model and the lower right side shows the motorization options'
p2607
aS" The picture of the B-model looks so cool, it could be a model of it's own  At this point I was very eager to build both models and compare them"
p2608
aS" THE SIDE One of the sides usually shows a part in 1:1 scale  This time it's one of the wheels indicating the size of the model"
p2609
aS' CONTENT OF THE BOX The box contains: 1 Book(let) 1 Sticker Sheet 13 Bags 4 Tires INSTRUCTION BOOKLET Since I own two copies of the set, I also received two instruction booklets'
p2610
aS" What's catching my eye is that my second copy is supplied in different packaging than the first one"
p2611
aS" It's for the first time (that I am aware of) that the instruction booklet and stickers come in a sealed bag, without cardboard back"
p2612
aS' Hopefully this will be a new standard for all sets with sticker sheets  Instead of multiple booklets, this set contains a single square bound book'
p2613
aS" In earlier reviews I have epxressed my preference for a single book  I don't see any advantage in having 2, 3 or even up to 6 booklets"
p2614
aS" STICKER SHEET Like the actual model, the sticker sheet looks very vibrant  The bright green, white and black color combination has found it's way to the stickers as well"
p2615
aS" Either you love 'em or hate 'em  Since I started writing reviews I have been applying stickers and I am happy I started doing it  Stickers do give the model it's finishing touch"
p2616
aS' BAGS WITH PARTS Thirteen bags with a total of 1219 parts (give or take a few) are supplied in the densily packed box  The rims and flex are sealed in a bag as well'
p2617
aS' Sometimes looking at the bags makes you wonder what the logic is, behind the distribution of the various parts across the different bags  Well this time it really got me confused'
p2618
aS" Take a look at two of the bags below  There's a bag containing all the 3L Blue Pins  Then there's a bag with various parts    and a single 3L Blue Pin"
p2619
aS' I figured this might be an error, but both of the sets have the same anomaly  TIRES The tires have been supplied unbagged, as usual  HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This chapter describes new and interesting parts'
p2620
aS" This set actually contains a lot of them  This set also contains an abundance of panels  If you aren't into panels, this isn't the set for you"
p2621
aS" CHANGEOVER CATCH This year (2015) the new changeover catch parts were released  It's a combination of three parts"
p2622
aS' The advantage of the new parts is that the red gear is the same on both sides, which avoids mounting it the wrong way around'
p2623
aS" It also avoids the changeover catch slipping out of the driving ring, like it used to do  You can apply lots of pressure, but the catch doesn't slip out"
p2624
aS" PINS Some of last year's new pins are also included in this set  12 x Pin with Pin Hole and 21 x 3L Pin with 1L Axle  Securing Technic Beams can be quite simple with the new Pin with Pin Holes"
p2625
aS' The new 3L Pin with 1L Axle gives you more possibilities when connecting Beams and other parts  Below are two example situations where the new pins have been used'
p2626
aS' Granted, the examples below can be accomplished by using other techniques  However, some predicaments from the past can be easily solved by using these new parts'
p2627
aS' Like me, you will most likely appreciate the ease of use'
p2628
aS' ENGINE AND SUSPENSION Also included are two Steering Portal Hubs and Steering Portal Hubs with Ball Joint Arms and four Steering Portal Axles for driving and steering the vehicle'
p2629
aS' These parts are commonly used nowadays  The picture below also shows some other parts, like gear rack, steering arms and suspension'
p2630
aS' FRAMES This set comes with a single 5x7 Frame and three 5x11 Frames  PANELS This set contains a whopping 47 panels in three different colors'
p2631
aS' I personally like panels a lot and I do appreciate the variety we have at our disposal lately  This set even contains a new 13x3x2 Curved "Mudguard" Panel'
p2632
aS" NEW 13x3x2 CURVED PANEL This is the first set to contain the new 13x3x2 Curved Panel  Looking at the pictures doesn't do these panels justice  In real life they are actually quite big"
p2633
aS' I figured they would be smaller, but they are even longer than the 11 x 5 frame, with a length of 13 (including the attachment points)'
p2634
aS' Hopefully this part will be available in other colors as well, preferably white, for adding variety to your EV3 robot'
p2635
aS' 19L WHITE FLEX-AXLES The White 19L Flex Axles have only been released in a single set, the 8461 Williams F1 Racer in 2002'
p2636
aS' Current prices on Bricklink are as high as 15 Euros! Needless to say we are very happy with the return of these White Axles'
p2637
aS" Now we can build Jeroen Ottens' awesome Alfa Romeo 4C Spider for a decent price as well"
p2638
aS" I am really happy that useful rare parts are being used more often by TLG designers PART LIST Here's the complete list for all 1219 parts"
p2639
aS' As you can see in the Highlighted parts section, this set contains a lot of interesting and useful parts'
p2640
aS" If you don't own sets like the 8070 - Supercar, this might be the set to pick up if you want to start building your own supercar"
p2641
aS" THE BUILD Enough with all the set and part information, let's build the model  REAR SUSPENSION The build starts with the rear suspension and drivetrain"
p2642
aS' As you can see in the picture below, the length of the Axle between the Steering CV Joint is 4L, where it usally is 3L'
p2643
aS' This is an indication that the finished model will be a bit bigger than usual (8070 for example)  The finished suspension is one of the cleanest suspension setups I have seen in an official model'
p2644
aS" It's pretty basic, but it works like a charm  This setup is defintely worth using in your MOC  Here's a video: After attaching the suspension to the frame you rotate the module and secure it"
p2645
aS' At this stage the rear section of the chassis with suspension is almost finished  V8 MID-ENGINE Extending the chassis forward results in the picture below, where the front spoiler is already visible'
p2646
aS" What's also visible is the V8 engine placed right in front of the rear axle, resulting in a Mid-engine setup, perfectly suited for sports and race cars"
p2647
aS' Two exhaust pipes have been fitted on either side of the engine, together with two hoses attaching them to the engine'
p2648
aS' The instructions are easy to follow, although you sometimes you need to bend the beams a bit  Minor improvements are possible here and there, but nothing shocking'
p2649
aS' FRONT SUSPENSION The front suspension is a bit more complicated than the rear suspension, which makes sense considering the fact it contains the steering rack'
p2650
aS' The shock absorbers are placed in a different angle than the rear ones, resulting in a somewhat stiffer front suspension'
p2651
aS' All in all the front suspension is well designed and the steering rack can be easily powered with a Servo Motor  The picture belows shows the front suspension attached to the chassis'
p2652
aS' If you follow the official instructions to motorize the model, the area in front of the suspension is used to mount the battery box'
p2653
aS" When you are modding this model to make it Full RC this area can be used to mount the servo motor  GEARBOX Like the gearbox in the 8070, it's not used to switch gears powering the drivetrain"
p2654
aS" It's used to switch between two functions, opening the doors and the hood/bonnet  The gearbox is located at the left of the vehicle, near the cockpit"
p2655
aS' The mechanism to open the doors is located on the left side, while opening the hood/bonnet is taking place at the right side'
p2656
aS' To accomplish this, some axles traverse under the cockpit to the other side of the vehicle  Following the axles to other side of the vehicle and adding some gears, results in the situation below'
p2657
aS' The video below shows the gearbox in action  DOOR OPENING MECHANISM The mechanism to open the door is comprised of some Knob Wheels, Links without Stoppers and Pins with Towballs'
p2658
aS' Take a look at the doors opening and closing  THE FRONT Using the new mudguards and various other panels you finish the front of the car  The front is probably the most controversial part of the car'
p2659
aS' This is caused by the preliminary pictures shown before the release of this car'
p2660
aS' In the early pictures the front of the car had smooth curves and beautiful lines, while the final car lost these smooth lines and got a more blocky look in return'
p2661
aS" I must admit that at a first glance, the new design lost some of it's appeal  However, this model grew on me pretty rapidly"
p2662
aS' The headlight design can be found, in more or less the same way, on several real Le Mans type race cars'
p2663
aS' THE REAR The rear of the car looks great, with the stickers continuing from the mudguards to the panels underneath the spoiler  The two exhausts sticking out give some details to the back'
p2664
aS" I absolutely disagree with all the negativity surrounding this car  Maybe it's one of those models which needs to grow on you  FINISHED MODEL Here it is, the finished model"
p2665
aS" I know some of you don't like the looks of the car, but I think it looks great  The color scheme is outstanding"
p2666
aS' The new (for Technic) bright green parts, combined with white and black make this car look very vibrant and colorful'
p2667
aS' I am not a big fan of the green used in the 42008 - Service Truck, but I do like this bright green a lot  It fits perfectly well with the Mindstorms EV3 set'
p2668
aS' The curves on the side of the car are not as smooth as some of us hoped, but I still think the car looks more than acceptable from the side'
p2669
aS' The stickers add some nice details to the car, giving it that characteristic race car look  The model looks great in pictures, but it does even look better in real life'
p2670
aS' I love this picture of the front of the car'
p2671
aS" However, I do wonder if a dedicated 24 hour Le Mans Racer has the seat and steering positioned off-center?! Using the good ol' Google Machine I come to the conclusion that they do have centered seating and steering, at least the majority of them"
p2672
aS" There's ample space in the cabin, which makes me wonder why TLG decided to place the seat off-centered"
p2673
aS' The rear view looks cool too, with some of the suspension showing and the two exhaust pipes clearly visible  The bottom view is very useful to determine the size of the car in studs'
p2674
aS' It measures approx 59 x 27 studs  The chassis looks organized and well designed  The engine has been placed close to the ground, which is perfect for the weight distribution'
p2675
aS' A low center of gravity improves the handling of the car  I really enjoyed building this baby'
p2676
aS' The build is very clean and organized, although there are some steps where you need to bend the beams a bit to get things into place'
p2677
aS' Seeing the model come to life and seeing it grow to pretty impressive proportions is very satisfying  For me it was fun, but I reckon kids will go nuts over this set and the build'
p2678
aS" SIZE COMPARISON What became obvious during the build, but what's emphasized when you have finished the model, is that it's quite big! The size of the car is pretty impressive"
p2679
aS" The pictures below show the car next to the 42030 - Volvo L350F  The side view emphasizes the size of the car  It's even longer than the Volvo, if you dismiss the bucket  PARTS LEFT Some parts left"
p2680
aS" Nothing out of the ordinary  FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS Unlike the B-model, this model doesn't implement any unexpected features"
p2681
aS' The functions it does implement are exactly what you would expect from any car'
p2682
aS" Steering (HoG) Working fake engine Suspension Opening doors (gullwing style) Opening bonnet/hood Opening trunk Gearbox for switching between functions Unfortunately the steering wheel hasn't been linked to the HoG (Hand of God) steering mechanism"
p2683
aS" Placing the seat in the center would have provided an easy way to link the steering wheel to the steering mechanism  it's a shame we hardly see actual steering anymore"
p2684
aS' Opening the hood actually opens up the entire rear section of the car, providing you with easy access to the motor compartment'
p2685
aS' The mechanism to open the hood works properly, which results in smooth opening and closing of it  The same goes for the gullwing style doors'
p2686
aS' Both functions are operated manually and you need to switch with the lever to the left of the cockpit'
p2687
aS' These two functions are also the ones which can be motorized by placing an M-motor near the cockpit and a battery box in the trunk  All things considered I think this car offers lots of playability'
p2688
aS" The model is solidly built and the functions are easy to operate  I'd say it's pretty safe to let your kids play with it"
p2689
aS" B-MODEL Unlike the A-model, the B-model for this set received (almost) universal acclaim, and I can see why  Often the B-model is a pale shadow of it's part donor"
p2690
aS" In this case the model looks so good, it could be a model of it's own  It even incorporates a neat feature, which actually deserves to be in the A-model"
p2691
aS" There's a lot a variation in the quality of digital building instructions TLG is providing, but these ones are of very high quality"
p2692
aS' The picture below shows most of the chassis with suspension, fake engine and gearbox in place  FINISHED MODEL Some concessions have been made, but overall the car looks fantastic'
p2693
aS' The black of the roof has been extrapolated from the hood, which definitely works for me'
p2694
aS" The rear section of the car feels a bit empty, but the panels do cover up most of it, so it's hardly noticeable  The V8 stickers will be upside down if you use the parts from the A-model"
p2695
aS" Since I could apply new stickers, I have placed them using the proper orientation  The bottom of the car shows the chassis  It's obviously a bit smaller than the A-model's chassis"
p2696
aS" FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS Taking the functions into account, this model isn't playing second fiddle to the A-model"
p2697
aS' Besides the obvious functions like steering, opening doors and hood, this car features folding fog lights, which deserve a better podium than a B-model'
p2698
aS' Steering (Hog) Working fake engine Suspension Opening doors (manually) Opening hood/bonnet (manually) Opening trunk (operated by gear) Folding fog lights (operated by gear) Gearbox (used to switch functions) FOG LIGHTS One of the most interesting features of the B-model are the folding Fog Lights'
p2699
aS' It almost feels a bit weird that a feature like this is implemented in the B-model, instead of the A-model  Below are 4 steps showing how the mechanism works  I have also included a video'
p2700
aS" The mechanism is somewhat reminiscent of fork mechanism used in the 8109 - Flatbed Truck, which has been described in Efferman's Review  Take a look at the video to the fog lights in action"
p2701
aS" PARTS LEFT A fair number of parts left, which isn't uncommon for a B-model  SUMMARY To summarize how I feel about this set, you need to take a look at the picture below"
p2702
aS' The combined image reflects the quality of this set    or better yet    sets! You actually get two great models, for the price of one'
p2703
aS" You don't like the A-model? No problem, you can have lots of fun with the B-model  I can't stop playing with the fog lights, it's mesmarizing  The color scheme on both models is outstanding"
p2704
aS" I simply can't emphasize enough how well this color scheme pleases the eye"
p2705
aS' The regular green is dull and boring, but this bright green really pops out, especially when combined with black and white, and possibly some red details'
p2706
aS' Black, white and a little red?! Sounds familiar? Yes, bright green can easily be combined with your EV3 robots'
p2707
aS' So while you are combining the bright green with your robot, why not use the great new curved "mudguard" panels  These new panels are introduced in this set and they look great'
p2708
aS" They open up a lot of possibilities in the design department  The build of the A-model is outstanding  It is fairly simple, but since it's so clean, I really enjoyed it a lot"
p2709
aS" I think the build should be entertaining, which doesn't mean it needs to be a real challenge"
p2710
aS" And let's be honest; when is a build really challenging?! The rear suspension is a good example of why I liked the build  It's very simple, yet very effective  Works like a charm"
p2711
aS' The same goes for the other functions in both models  And the star of the entire show can be found in the B-model'
p2712
aS" How's that for a surprise?! Being aware of the fact that I like this model a lot better than most of you seem to do, I really encourage you to give this model a chance"
p2713
aS' The sheer size is impressive, the color scheme is awesome and you get a bonus model, which is actually worth building'
p2714
aS' SCORE Okay, so how do I grade this set? 8 DESIGN Open to debate, but I like it a lot  8 BUILDING EXPERIENCE Fun and clean build  9 FEATURES Superb function in B-model steels the show'
p2715
aS' 9 PLAYABILITY Both models offer lots of playability 8 PARTS Lots of new parts and cool existing parts  10 VALUE FOR MONEY Two models for the price of one'
p2716
aS' 8,7 TWICE THE FUN I hope you enjoyed this review! More pictures can be found on my Flickr page '
p2717
aS' Outstanding review Jim, congrats ! Love the pictures, so clean and crisp   Hope to see many more of your reviews'

aS' It is function and aerodynamics over form'

p2792
aS' but I agree with everything else, most notably removable front and rear bodywork (the removable engine cover on 8674 would be a good starting point here) and the inclusion of some nod towards a hybrid system'
p2793
aS" It's also worth remembering the preliminary design did have the Big Honking Fin (BHF) that is mandatory on all current prototypes, so maybe when that was removed any trace of a tunnel or diffuser went with it"
p2794
aS' On the subject of steering wheels, all modern prototypes actually have left or right hand drive  The regulations demand that both LMP1 and LMP2 cars are nominally capable of seating two people'
p2795
aS' Of course in practise the "extra seat" is taken up by the hybrid system in LMP1 and electronics/extra cockpit access in LMP2'
p2796
aS" However this doesn't change the fact that it would be easy to link the steering wheel to the HoG/front axle  Edited by Jay Psi, 12 March 2015 - 09:55 PM "

aS' I have been waiting for this set since the pictures for the toy fairs eirlier in the year and I am glad to say I am not disapointed  First the price it is not cheap at ?99'
p2861
aS'99 but I guess that is typical for a set with this amount of electronics in it There is no parts count and I have not had time to add up the 2 pages of contents to get a figure'
p2862
aS' First the box standard flip top with large internal picture and rip to open lid'
p2863
aS' inside There are no numbered bags in this set which I prefer I like to open all the bags and put all the parts in the box before building'
p2864
aS' Next is a picture on the electronics 2 XLmotors as lego describe them and 2 standard motors'
p2865
aS' 2 IR receivers and 1 IR transmitter I know these have been discussed before but I really like the thought that has gone into the transmitters/receivers each receiver has 2 outputs to corespond with the 2 controls on transmitter they also have a choice of 4 channels so one transmitter can control up to 8 independant motors by changing the channel switch'
p2866
aS' The transmitter also has a neat motor direction switch so you can configure the transmitter operation'
p2867
aS' The set comes with three manuals 1 is the main drive mechanism 2 is the cab and engine and 3 is the attachments front and back'
p2868
aS' There is also the now standard parts list in the back of the third manual'
p2869
aS' There is no alternative model instructions despite the pictures of one on the box however there is a reference to the technic website on the back of the box but at the moment the page only has an advert saying the set is to be released on 1st September so I guess I will have to wait untill then to see if the instructions will be online'
p2870
aS' The build is fairly straight forward the main chassis is studless, the next picture shows the motors mounted into the chassis and the drive for the shovel and claw'
p2871
aS' It also shows the V6 technic engine  This next picture shows the IR receivers mounted on the back'
p2872
aS' The battery box slots into the back and can be easily slid out with the removal of two pins which is useful because I can imagine I will need to change the batteries on a regular basis'
p2873
aS' The next 2 picture are of the completed model Overall I was very happy with the finished dozer the functions work really well and as I have the monster dino I have used a second transmitter so I dont have to touch the channel switch, I have included some video On my Brickshelf page'
p2874
aS' Unfortunately this set does suffer from some quality issues for example moulding marks on the plates, colour diferences, some of the pins not finished properly, some pins were very stiff and quite hard to push into the holes but the worst issue was an axle that would not turn freely in a hole which just adds extra friction into the system'
p2875
aS' I am glad to see some studded technic in this set I much prefer sets that use both varieties of technic beam'
p2876
aS' There are only 2 Fairings which is a great improvment over recent sets if TLC had tried to make the bulldozer shovel with fairings this would have been a complete disaster'
p2877
aS' Marks for the set 8/10 for price with the number of motors I expected it to be greater  9/10 for fun my kids love this type of set that does something when finished'

p2974
aS' The new small Technic sets have incredible functionality for their size, and this one is no exception'
p2975
aS' With only 106 parts this crane can roll, extend, rotate, lift (and hold in any position) and has working stabilisers! The boom extends the same as the other sets with this boom; simply pull it'
p2976
aS' It works surprisingly well and due to circular ridges inside the boom the extension (which is just a standard beam) will hold in place  The gear at the back controls the height of the boom'
p2977
aS' As you can see the boom is only half extended  Boom fully extended, half down  The cable is kept in place via two gears and a blue pin, same as the 7905 crane'
p2978
aS' Even under decent weights this works well  The stabilisers however cannot handle much weight once the load is moved off axis  The stablilsers are a very simple but effective design'
p2979
aS' Another shot of the stablilsers  This also shows how far the boom will decend  The boom height mechanism works well also  I love the cab design'

aS" I highly recommend it  Great review Sinner! I'll be picking up this set for sure  Probbly a few just for the parts  But one question"
p3021
aS" What Crane are you refering to that came with 7998? That is the new heavy loader, and it didn't come with an any crane> 8-?"

aS' My mistake  I meant 7898  :-$'
p3024
aS" Alright, so I usually do quick photo reviews when I get new sets  That's what I'll do here, but there's quite a few photos, so I thought I might as well make its own review thread"
p3025
aS" So, I got the Kwik-E-Mart by paying just2much on an early eBay copy  I think it's worth it, as this week I'm gonna be super busy, so I was able to build it Saturday and stuff"
p3026
aS" Here's my video review, I think it's one of my best: Well, let's get onto this photo review  The set is $200 USD with a little over 2100 pieces"
p3027
aS' The official release is April 15th for VIP members, May 1st for everyone else at LEGO Stores  And, if you want full size pictures, check out my Flickr by clicking here'
p3028
aS' The minifigures included are great'
p3029
aS' You get three exclusive minifigures (one being a completely exclusive character- the first time LEGO has ever put an exclusive mould in a Direct to Consumer set), and you get three of the series most popular characters in their normal attire for those who missed out on the first Simpsons minifigures series'
p3030
aS" The Kwik-E-Mart's exterior is loaded with lots of sticker details"
p3031
aS" The only printed detail you'll see in the exterior is the dial pad in the phone booth, which has appeared in some other licensed themes since last year"
p3032
aS' ( ^^^ right here is there the store can be opened- a simple Technic pin and receiver keeps it in place and allows for opening and closing) The roof of the store includes the garden shown in the Paul McCartney episode'
p3033
aS" The roof can be slided out/in once you open it with the hinge part  Here's a look at the store with the roof removed"
p3034
aS' The floors are a nice sand blue color, coming with 8x16 thin plates: And, for the interior, from the view of the store opened with the hinges at the back that I mentioned earlier: The left front corner, which includes some arcade machines of Bonestorm and Great White Hunter, an amazingly done Buzz cola soda machine, juice machine, the checkout counter, ect: The right front corner, with food aisles, freezers, and a frozen Jasper sticker: The back left corner, which includes some nice coffee kettle builds, the donut tray, hotdogs, ect: The right back corner, which has a door leading to a very small hallway that only has a mouse and cheese in it'
p3035
aS" The hallway leads to the employees only door in the back, and it's very hard to get in the door way (not that there's anything to do inside there): Also included is Clancy's copcar, which fits three figures: Here's a look at the piece list in the instructions, click on each to be lead to an enlarged version of the pic: Also included are some awesome printed pieces, and two unprinted coffee cups! Honestly, I think this set is perfect"
p3036
aS' The price is fantastic, and has a great PPP ratio  They really went above and beyond by including Snake in this set'
p3037
aS" I honestly think it's better than the Simpsons House in terms of accuracy and the value here- so many cool pieces printed and in exclusive colors  So, that's my quick picture review"
p3038
aS" Hope you guys enjoyed, and I'd love to hear your thoughts!"

aS' I agree, but so many people were complaining about how The Simpsons House should have included the most common versions (mostly because the eyes or whatever), so I think LEGO played it safe and just included the normal versions'
p3063
aS' It makes sense, since Series 1 is gone forever, and the common versions were in there, and this set is bound to be in stock for a very long time like the Death Star'

p3066
aS' Hello everyone  Excellent review! English is not my native language, but I want to express my opinion'
p3067
aS" Simpsons house was the first of its kind, and I can say without exaggeration that this is the most impressive set that I'm going (my collection http://brickset com/sets/ownedby-celeb )"
p3068
aS' I look at the video from the Kwik-e-Mart, and is difficult to say how good it is compared with the house'
p3069
aS' The main disadvantages that I said to myself, is this: build the walls of the large panels, next is access to the roof (gray parts in front of the back door (I think they represent the stairs)) is not on the level with doors on the roof and when you open them, you can see the white block is openly trash, my points of view'
p3070
aS' Boxes on the left of go to the store and powersauce box, i want see make real and not just a cube, f e  such as in the unreleased Star Wars set  About minifigures, I fully agree with Robert8'
p3071
aS' Two more of the same Homer, Marge and Bart?! Personally, I put my set as a scene and all the replays minifigure are inside the house that was not identical characters next And also absolutely terrible Bart`s accessory This set is made parking for bikes and it looks very cool'
p3072
aS" But damn, it is hoped to see the Bart or Lisa's bike, instead of useless balloons with paint"
p3073
aS' The walls are made with convex inside panels, why so? can anyone know? have not seen any pictures with such walls in TV show'
p3074
aS' Why did not they turn? I personally really like how realized roof, but my brother says that it is terrible :) garden could do more in the series there were almost jungle I do not know how to be considered here, maybe anyone can express any opinion or idea? I look at the Simpsons house, and then look at the photo of this e-Mart'
p3075
aS' I can not understand, in the house we have a garage, two floors, cool floor, a lot of furniture, all the rooms and walls, collected from cubes, many additional accessories'
p3076
aS' And where is all this detail here? It looks much smaller (maybe even poorer)'
p3077
aS' If they still will release next year comic book store, it will be even less? Of course it is difficult to estimate without seeing it live, we have it will be sold only in May'
p3078
aS' At first sight it does not look so impressive as the house'
p3079
aS' Can certainly the case in the limit on the amount of detail, but why it was impossible to add $ 50 to the cost and make Jasper, the more detailed the roof, the walls of the smaller elements, that it was not convex'
p3080

aS' Due to a larger BL order in the U S  I couldn?t resist to add two Hopper Waggons to my train layout  Here?s a review of this fantastic set  The box  Well, there?s nothing really special about it'
p3270
aS' The open box with three polybags  Note, that there are only three different colors used in that set (actually there are 4, but you can?t see the dark grey ones)  Great color composition by the way'
p3271
aS' *wub* And - NO STICKERS !!! - :-D Oooops - I opened the bags too fast  Help me, I?m drowning! *sing* Not following the instructions, I built the wheels first to get the larger pieces out of the way'
p3272
aS' Keep on rolling  This is the load of the hopper waggon  11 round bricks altogether  When I opened the set, I was curious if it was a new colored set or an old one'
p3273
aS' Luckily enough it was an old one, with old dark grey  I don?t know if TLC ever produced this set with bley  From the following pic you can clearly see, that the set is an old one'
p3274
aS' Look at these slope bricks  See what I mean? All bricks are looking exactly the same! Buy a set today means get at least three different textures on the slopes and maybe even more shades of tan'
p3275
aS' :-X >:-( I have said that in many other threads here and I?m saying it again: Back to the roots, Lego! You were able to produce good quality'
p3276
aS' Show us you can still do it! *sad* But now to the building  It?s a 6 x 24 train base plate you?re building on  Did I say I liked the colors? :-D This is the mechanism to unload the waggon'
p3277
aS' Built in the waggon with open gates        and with closed ones  Almost done  This is the first time, I realized that minifigs actually can step on those ladders'
p3278
aS' :-$ A short lift and the wheels are fixed'
p3279
aS" This darn mechanism! Wait, I?m coming with my monkey wrench! >:-) Who opened that door again? Do I have to do it all on my own? :'-( Finally the work is done  Now have a brake"
p3280
aS' One shot from the front/back  You can see the car is really huge! 8-? I put it behind the red car of the 4512  That sure looked very strange'
p3281
aS' *wacko* The set fits a lot better to the other cars of the "My Own Train" theme than to the older ones  The Score: Brick selection: 10/10 excellent color and brick selection (these were the days  '
p3282
aS') Playability: 9/10 great unloading mechanism Price/piece count ratio: 8/10 at peeron it says 20$, I got it for 39,95$ -> 30?/228 bricks'
p3283
aS' Not really cheap, but worth every cent! :-) Overall rating: 9/10 and a definity "must buy" for rolling stock lovers  Sad enough it?s not available on S@H any more'
p3284
aS' But there are still sets on BL and ebay  That?s for now folks, thank you for reading  I have some job to do   '

Rp3382
aS' Yes my SpongeBob fans, its time for another review !! Lets look at our Bikini Bottom map and head strait to meet Miss Puff at her Boating school'
p3383
aS' She is waiting for us to give us a guided tour of her establishment ;-) Another bit of SB history: this set comes from the following episode: Boating School: SpongeBob fails his boating test for the 38th time (what a freaking retard lool)'
p3384
aS" He's so determined to get his license that Patrick decides to help him  He implants a walkie-talkie inside SB?s head in order to cheat and tell him what to do"
p3385
aS' You will say that I am biais but I really enjoy building this set and I really like the SB theme !! Lets hope 2008 brings more of that cool spongieness !! But I digress  '
p3386
aS' Here are general pics of the instruction booklet and the DSS (G there are loads of crappy stickers in that one also !!)  As you can see the set is divided in 3 polybags'
p3387
aS' Shamelessly (but nonetheless wilfully hehe), I will disregard the third one which is that playability crap course !! I would have reviewed it but since it involves stickers, I didn?t want to ruin the parts and without stickers it would look dull, plain and ugly (it does look crappy with so imagine without), so that review will not be 100% complete and I do apologise in advance'
p3388
aS' But how many of you would have build that and keep it hehe Off :-P 1/ Mfs and extras I will start with the really cool Miss Puff *wub* (the fig mind you !!)'
p3389
aS' She looks a bit stressed !! No wonder, that sponge menace will bring her to the hospital once again hehe  As you can see, that MF comprises 3 parts: the small blue 1x1 round and the 2 major parts'
p3390
aS' Yeay another great stupid looking SB  I love those idiotic faces !! 3 different SB figs and 3 idiotic faces hehe  You never can get enough of them !! Here is just a regular Patrick'
p3391
aS' Too bad Patrick doesn?t have different expressions ! The pull back boat car: nothing really to report (except the fact that I left it sticker free !!) The only thing I built from the third polybag is that pretty cool ancker holding tower thingie !! Looks great in a lighthouse set hehe'
p3392
aS" Yes the roud tile bouey is printed !! Its the same as in SB's bed in the Bikini Bottom set ;-) OK, its time for those two great buildings: the lighthouse and the school + pontoon !! Before reviewing them individually, here is a general pic"
p3393
aS' 2/ The lighthouse One of the main reason to own that great set !! Sure it suffers from accute stickeretite (sad but :-D )'
p3394
aS' T worst is that door), but nonetheless a great and simple building !! Great white/red colour scheme, and a really fantastic 2 turning lights !! I really like the yellow top of the lighthouse, it adds to the comic atmosphere of that theme instead of having a more plain red/white only'
p3395
aS' The rear has nothing really fancy, except tools to fix it in case of problems hehe'
p3396
aS' The only thing I modified since I didn?t build the third polybag is that I got rid of the trechnic parts on the right of the lighthoue to replace them with regular ?logs? All hail the tower King !! :-D 3/ The school and pontoon I really like that little building and its great to see that once again TLC uses the amazing dark blue color !! Its really a simple design but looks fantastic and can be used for many things in a town hehe I also really like the combination with those dark bluish grey slopes !! The rear reveals the desk, stickers on the wall (d?oh !!) and two clams serving as chairs (really like on the show)'
p3397
aS' Its really great to see that TLC stays really as close to the show as possible  The pontoon again is simple yet really cool and effective  And its really nice to have 2 lifesaving boueys'
p3398
aS' The only thing I modified since I didn?t build the third polybag is that I got rid of the trechnic parts in front of the pontoon to replace them with regular ?logs? On the overall, I think its really a great set !! Apart from the crap stickers, I think TLC should have ditched (or simplified) the third playability polybag to lower the cost !! Oh well, parts are always usefull (except those one part shitty palm trees !!)'
p3399
aS' So until my next review, I bid you farewell my Spongebob fans !! And I really hope to see next year hehe Will SB get his driver?s license one day ? For the sake of Bikini Bottom, lets hope not !! No license ever On !! *yoda*'
p3400
aS' That?s really a great and overall nice playset with a very cool Mrs'
p3401
aS' Puff and a fine new Spongebob! *sweet* The boating school?s indeed very nice with a beautiful color scheme, and so is the lighthouse   '
p3402
aS' I?m really tempted to buy a second set just to "complete" these buildings     although it?s a little too expensive for doing so, and it wouldn?t even fit with the style of the other SB sets'
p3403
aS' X-D Wet highway to the poor puffer fish? privat hell on! :-D'

aS" You've done it again  *yoda* ! Great reveiw  I really like this set, but in my opinon, $50 is steep considering I won't actually 'play' with it"

aS' The set, and the other Designer sets that came out with it (especially 4888) are incredibly well designed sets'

aS" I love the dark orange bricks; great for rust    He is quite solid, but the joints take the weight well  The neck goes side to side and rotates, but doesn't go up and down"

aS' The body is built in two parts and pinned in the middle  With what is left you can make what I think is a hyena, a silly plant MOC       and what I believe is a vulture'

aS' There are also instructions for a few other models including a bat, boar and a snake    which I quite like  He can be built at the same time as       this cute little lizard'

aS'99 Minifigs: 2 Theme: Jurassic World Year of Release: 2015 Links: Box The front of the box has the Jurassic World logo along with the set number, piece count, etc  Its a decent box size for a $20 set'
p3596
aS" Here it is compared to a minifigure  Here's the back of the box  It shows all of the features from the set an ad for the video game"
p3597
aS' The back also shows a small picture with a silhouette of the dinosaurs from the line, along with their set numbers'
p3598
aS' Instruction Booklet The booklet shows the same thing as the front of the box, nothing more, nothing less  Near the back of the booklet, there is a picture with all of the characters from the sets'
p3599
aS' The other page shows all the dinosaurs with a mini box that shows the size comparisons  The Minifigures The minifigures in this set are Simon Masrani and an ACU'
p3600
aS' Both of them have excellent printing on the front and the back  The gun is the same one from TLM that the SSP used  Simon Masrani is the only one with a double sided face'
p3601
aS' His second face shows a scared/worried exp<b></b>ression  He has a zipped up jacket or jumpsuit with a shirt underneath  The ACU trooper only has one face which is a scared/worried exp<b></b>ression'
p3602
aS" I would have a scared exp<b></b>ression too if I was about to get eaten by a dinosaur  He has great detail on his torso and legs  Let's take a look at the vest"
p3603
aS' The vest is the same mold from the SSP in TLM I think  It has the letters ACU on the front too  The back is nothing interesting  Pteranodon The pteranodon has great printing too'
p3604
aS' The colors match the ones that the pteranodons from the movie have  The wings, mouth, and head are a rubbery type of plastic and are easily bendable'
p3605
aS" It uses the same mold from the pteranodon in the 2012 Dino line  Here's a comparison between the two  Spare Parts The spare parts aren't many, just a few extras"
p3606
aS" The Helicopter At first the helicopter was 'meh' when I first saw it on the box  Now that I've built it, I've got to say that I really like it"
p3607
aS" Its my favorite helicopter of all of the ones I've built  Its sturdy and sleek  It's not too bulky either  The first play feature in this set is the net launcher"
p3608
aS" It works pretty well, not one of my favorite features but it does what it's meant to do  The other play feature is on the other side  Its a stud shooter which can be used by a minifigure"
p3609
aS' You can put it on their hand or you can leave it there and let someone operate it  The shooter can fold up inside the helicopter as well'
p3610
aS" There are stickers on both sides of the helicopter and they also have the Jurassic World logo with Dino marks  Final Verdict Value: 9/10 - For $20 this set isn't that bad"
p3611
aS' The parts count is a little low for a $20 set but the price is probably because of licensing'
p3612
aS" Other than that, it's a great deal, I would've hoped for maybe some bait for the pteranodon but that can easily be fixed"
p3613
aS" Design: 9/10 - I REALLY love the way this helicopter looks, it's sleekness and design is great  The only flaw this has is the huge net launcher, it's too big in my opinion"
p3614
aS' Minifigs: 10/10[/b] - The minifigures are extremely detailed and it even includes an exclusive minifigure  Playability: 9/10 - There are many things you can do with this set'
p3615
aS" The swoosh factor is great and so are the play features  Parts: 10/10[/b] - They're useful parts and there isn't many huge specialized pieces in here either"
p3616
aS" Overall: 9/10 - This set is great for fans of Jurassic World, it's also a nice parts pack  There's one exclusive minifigure in here too which makes it even better"

p3635
aS' It is a standard size and had plenty of room for all the parts  The front depicts the whole set with a little hexagon on the right with a seperate picture of the dinosaur and its name'
p3636
aS' In this case the Celophysis is called Gallimimus  Weird choice Next is the instruction sheet  It is a doublesided paper with every building step in clear sight  The part selection is nice'
p3637
aS' There are only a few but all of them are pretty usefull for all kind of builds  There are two parts which stood-out  Both are printed tiles  The first one is the yellow/black warning tile in 1x4'
p3638
aS" You can't have enough of that  The second one is a 2x2 tile with the Jurassic World logo on it  That's pure awesome"
p3639
aS' The bigger sets seem to have only sticker for that, so this little set is a perfect way to get hold of this nice tile  The leftovers  Nothing special  Here is the complete trap'
p3640
aS' It is a basic build and functions pretty well  In the end the parts are more interesting as the build so it will definitely end up as a parts-pack  Now on to the star of this bag'
p3641
aS" The Celophysis/Gallimimus  I don't know why Lego decided to call this dinosaur mold any different, but I think it has to do with movie-connection and the will to not produce a new mold"
p3642
aS' Nevermind, this figure is great and the colour is very bright and totally stood out  Pretty beastie  A comparison between the 2015 Gallimimus and the 2012 Celophysis  The final set in all its glory'
p3643
aS' Final verdict: It is a great little set  The parts used a nice and usefull  The printed tiles are the secret stars of this set and the dinosaur is fun two'
p3644
aS' With a few packs of these you could easily build a Celophysis pack with lots of Jurassic World signs on their way  Highly recommended '

aS' I like the sorta-European looking backdrop; it goes well with the styling of the buildings  Interestingly, the main model is shown opened up for play, while the two insets show those versions folded'
p3701
aS' The Box Top On the top of the box, Lego helpfully shows that with 3 of these sets, you can make a whole street'
p3702
aS' The Box Back On the back, you get to again see all three versions together, but this time, folded'
p3703
aS" It's a little creepy though with those clones running around :) The Manuals Yep, three actual, printed manuals"
p3704
aS' There\'s nothing indicating them as being A, B, and C models, but it\'s pretty obvious looking at the designs which is the "main" model and which are the alternates'
p3705
aS' The Contents Bags of parts and two plates  Nothing terribly exciting to see here     The Minifigs Nothing new here, but two nice figs none-the-less'
p3706
aS" Well, Bricklink does say that both figs are unique to this set, but there's not any new parts to them"
p3707
aS" The closest thing to rare is the female head - it's only in this set, 2013's Dragon Mountain Castle set, a UK store grand opening set, and one of the 2014 Holiday freebie sets"
p3708
aS" The faces aren't that unique, but I guess this exact combo of two faces on the head is  I love the kid torso with the spaceman on it"
p3709
aS' The Minifig Backs No back printing on anything here except for an alternate female face  Sorry  I do like that her two faces are so different though'
p3710
aS' That\'s much better than when a head has a "scared" and a "more scared" face  The "C" Build Enough with the basics; let\'s build  I\'m going to review them in the same order I built them, backwards'
p3711
aS" Since you can tell immediately looking at the 3 designs that they're going to use different numbers of pieces and so forth, I figured I'd build the smallest first lest it seem like a letdown"
p3712
aS' All three have some basic similarities - the two plates are hinged to give a building that opens for play  They also do have interiors, which you can see starting to form here'
p3713
aS' The "C" Build, Front It\'s a pretty quick build, so it\'s done already  Here\'s the front of the building with it opened up'
p3714
aS' Like this, it appears to be two separate stores, a newsstand and some sort of shop you can enter'
p3715
aS" All the printed tiles help give the newsstand a detailed appearance, but I'm not sure why they've got a $100 bill lying on the ledge  "
p3716
aS' The "C" Build, Rear From the back side, the interiors are pretty plain  The shop half has a plant in a jar and a weird chair, and the newsstand just has a register'
p3717
aS' The "C" Build, Sides Here\'s the two sides of the folded building  On the hinge side, there\'s a bunch of windows in a disjointed wall with random colors'
p3718
aS' On the other, why did they put in a huge window when the set does include a trans-clear door that could have gone there? And you get a small patch of plants, like so many sets seem to have these days'
p3719
aS' The "C" Build, Extras That\'s a lot of leftovers there  And not just little stuff - multiple doors, stairs, etc  And unused sand green is always a little sad   '
p3720
aS' The "B" Build, 1 A pretty similar start, with the hinge and little garden and some tiles along the ground'
p3721
aS' The "B" Build, 2 Now we see a big windowed wall, some details like lights, and how it has the usual alternate model "weird part usage" - like a 1x4 brick with side studs being used over the doorway, even though those side studs will not get used'
p3722
aS' The "B" Build, Front The finished building gives us a nice little post office, with a letter-carrying bird on the roof'
p3723
aS" Hope that's not their normal method of delivery! Something about the colors just doesn't work for me though  The combo of white / light grey / dark grey / black / sand green plus tan is just too much"
p3724
aS' The tan window and door frames I don\'t like  The "B" Build, Inside On the inside, things are weird'
p3725
aS" The counter on the left is ok, but the light above the door (with a yellow clip? ugly!) is too big, and everything else over there by the door doesn't make much sense either"

aS' The "B" Build, Sides I like the front side here, except the colors are still too much  The bench, greenery, mailbox on the corner, and streetlight are all nice'
p3727
aS" The boy is a little creepy though - binoculars in hand PLUS a telescope on the roof of the post office? Why? The hinge side shows more of the weird colors you get in the wall, but that's going to be hidden when the set is open"
p3728
aS' Plus we even see that on big modulars at times, so it\'s not SO terrible  The "B" Build, Leftovers Again, a lot of leftover parts'
p3729
aS" It's obvious this was another alternate, but it'd be nice to see more of them used to make a bigger building  But let's move on to the model that DOES use them all  "
p3730
aS' The "A" Build, 1 The first half starts like this  Maybe it\'s just my bias, but it already feels like a more detailed build  Bottles on the wall, the yellow and red awning over the window, etc'
p3731
aS' The "A" Build, 2 The other half starts off with detailed work too  I think that\'s a red vending machine  The stairs are also VERY solidly built'
p3732
aS" I also appreciate the effort to get that diagonal base where a door will be - it's such a nice touch to have sections of a building that aren't right angles"
p3733
aS' The "A" Build, 3 Not too much has been added, but I wanted to showcase the tiny toys before they get hidden by a wall  That robot and train are just fantastic little micro builds'
p3734
aS' The "A" Build, 4 Things are coming together quickly  The walls, windows, and doors get the first floor nearly done'
p3735
aS' I\'m still not big on the sand green and tan combo, but I do really like the red and yellow awnings  The "A" Build, 5 It appears the shop owner lives upstairs, since we\'ve got a bedroom forming here'
p3736
aS' The bed is a little plain, but the table and lamp on the other half are great  And my big fingers did not like putting all those railings on the balcony, with the telescope posts and tile tops'
p3737
aS' Knocked quite a few off before I got them all done  The "A" Build, Front And it\'s done  All the details make this set really feel like a mini-modular'
p3738
aS" The roofline has great greebling, and the shop contents, and on and on  It's not perfect though  The tiny car above the toy store door isn't nearly as good as the toys inside"
p3739
aS" And the kid's yellow scooter? The wheels aren't even on the ground, much less able to roll  The scooter looks decent though, so that counts for something"
p3740
aS' Well, at least as long as you are at this angle, since the boy\'s only got 1 foot on the 1 stud wide scooter  The "A" Build, Inside Most of the interior has been seen already'
p3741
aS' The roof though does a nice job of being interesting for a roof  A skylight, the edge rails, etc  And you can see there\'s not much "wrong color" in the walls'
p3742
aS' The "A" Model, Sides An interesting building when folded up  Very tall and skinny  You can tell it\'s not really meant to be displayed this way - it\'s meant to be open'
p3743
aS' The good - lots! I like the awning, the diagonal door, the flowerbox under the upper window, the folding gate on the balcony that lets it be used in open or closed mode, and the green / white / blue colors'
p3744
aS' The bad - well, the stairs end short of the upper door, I still don\'t really like the tan doorframes (I think black would have been better), and why don\'t the upper floors match up in size? The "A" Model, Leftovers Ah, that\'s more like it'
p3745
aS' Just a few small pieces left as spares  The Errors You might have to click through to the full-size versions, but I did catch a few weird errors in the manuals'
p3746
aS' First, in the photo of the newsstand, the map in the front corner is on there sideways  The map does have a clear north arrow printed on it'
p3747
aS" On the second image, the boy's feet are hanging off the edge  Just unusual to see an alignment error in the manual like that"
p3748
aS" The Comparison Here are this set and the modular Detective Office side by side  There's a huge difference - as you'd expect  But is the difference MORE than you'd expect? This set is 466 parts, $40"
p3749
aS" The DO is 2262 pieces and $160  5 times the parts, 4 times the price  Looking at them side by side, I'd expect a bigger difference in both"
p3750
aS" The Conclusion So, what's my conclusion on this model? I love the main model, but the alternates are meh"
p3751
aS" It's a nice set for someone looking for a town building other than police and fire stations, but who isn't ready to move to the modular line  Compared to the modulars though, it seems overpriced"
p3752
aS' Part of that is because the huge modulars are actually a great deal compared to other Lego sets'
p3753
aS" I'm also a little surprised that it's so small, when you compare it to the City sets like a police station  Those are generally designed with much more open space, letting them be more of a playset"
p3754
aS" This one is small and cramped, so it'd be tougher to play in  It's not really a City set though"
p3755
aS" The Ratings Value: 7/10 - It's under the 10 cents a part mark, but that's largely due to having a TON of tiny parts"
p3756
aS" All those flowers and decorative 1x1 round studs add up quickly! Design: 7/10 - Good and bad on the colors, and there's a big difference between the quality of the main vs alternate models"
p3757
aS" Having so many leftover pieces is one thing when the Creator set makes 3 very different models (ie a boat, plane, and truck)  When it's 3 buildings, it seems wasteful to have so many parts leftover"
p3758
aS" Minifigs: 6/10 - I'm not sure they both fit the set  I suppose the boy is going to the toy store and the woman is going to the grocery? But there's no storekeeper in either"
p3759
aS" The woman doesn't look like a storekeeper to me, so that's why I assume she's another shopper"
p3760
aS" I love the boy, but the woman is just so-so - except that I do appreciate the head having two very different expressions  But again, that doesn't fit the set  I can't see her scared face being used"
p3761
aS" Playability: 6/10 - The shops are detailed with registers and so forth, but it's all so tiny it'd be hard to play with the figs in it"
p3762
aS' Parts: 9/10 - Tons of windows and doors, plus nice sand green bricks'
p3763
aS' But some things (the large blue curves used on the roof for example) are weirdly specialized and would be hard to use in another building design'
p3764
aS" Overall: 7/10 - I'd recommend doing what I did - build the alternates first, then the main since that's how you'll want to leave it"
p3765
aS" I'd really like to see the price a little lower compared to other sets (again, the part count is inflated due to SO MANY tiny parts) and the finished building is tiny, but it's loaded with neat details"

p3811
aS" They're the same concept (two buildings that fold in half) but the sidewalk is different size and they just feel differently styled to me "
p3812
aS' This seems like half of a set compared to the previous Bike Shop/Cafe'
p3813
aS' As I like many of the elements, I will probably buy a second one and build a mirror image version (making one entirely a toy shop and the other a book store/news stand) and adjust the sidewalks to work with the previous model'
p3814
aS' Then I think they will work well together  I remember a little area in Copenhagen that had this sort of architecture'
p3815
aS' I would hope the subsequent models are better deigned to create more complex alternatives, but these are both good starting points for original or enhanced models '
p3816
aS" As a fan of Creator houses, I really want to like this set  However, I think that Creator houses have long filled a niche that's neglected elsewhere: residential houses"
p3817
aS" We haven't had a larger residential house since 2013; I'm not sure if these sets have anything to do with that, but it seems like they may be the replacement for larger houses"
p3818
aS" And I'd much rather have a larger house set than a set like this  I also agree with many others here; something about it just feels incomplete"
p3819
aS" I think that the various City business buildings we've gotten in recent years (including those in this year's City Square--which is much more expensive than this, but also contains much more) make for better buildings at this scale"

p3860
aS" The colorful sets and manga-like characters didn't persuade me right away, but the urgent need for a couple of white 3x3 wing plates made me purchase this little thing"
p3861
aS' It cost me 70 DKR as you can see on the box  This is 9 30 euro, or about the same an American has to pay for the new Republic Cruiser'
p3862
aS' Pretty expensive for so few pieces (90 + a spare technic pin) The box An action-packed box with one of the sides being oddly empty except from the LEGO-logo'
p3863

p3865
aS' Every step was accompanied by an element description although I doubt most of you will need that with so few pieces to keep track on'
p3866
aS' Most of the dark green bricks have a sticker - even the slopes where the rough surface makes stickers fall off easily! There should also have been a sticker on the windshield, but I wanted to keep that piece clean for better usage later'
p3867
aS" (I'm one of those who keeps stickers on the bricks) The model You want to see this model from the front, as the back is pretty much neglected There isn't much for the pilot to grab a hold on either"
p3868
aS' He is pretty much a sitting duck up there with the screen giving him only partial cover  There is a huge wrench next to him which kind of symbolizes the crudeness of the mech'
p3869
aS' The set isn\'t called "Cyclone Defender" for nothing'
p3870
aS' The right arm might hold an ordinary light assault riffle, but the other has a spinning disc with samurai swords which you can turn with the yellow knob on the backside'
p3871
aS' Those of you who have seen Robot Wars might remember the incredible power of this melee weapon from a robot named Hypnodisc'
p3872
aS" It would have been nice had there been a pull-back motor to power the disc (I'm sure LEGO has a lot of these in stock), but the simple mechanism still works reasonably well"
p3873
aS' The riffle comes off and a pin makes it easy to hold with the hand, but the disc is fixed to the arm  It is also a problem that the swords get misaligned quickly during play'
p3874
aS' The minifig I really like this minifig because of the neat idea with an expression on each side that LEGO has made a standard for Exo Force'
p3875
aS" Posability Most mech-moc'ers show off their creations using Gundam-like poses"
p3876
aS' With two joints per leg (one being the ankles) and one for an arm I thought of some less serious poses: Crawling (Silent like a ninja!): Belly gliding: Kick off!; Upside down: Final Rating I have to disappoint you here'
p3877
aS' This is my first set in this line and I have absolutely no idea of how good it is'
p3878
aS' The last robot I bought was the awesome 6889 Spyrius Recon Robot for the same price, but it is in a completely different genre'
p3879
aS" The set had what I expected (two white wings) and is as such a no-nonsense set  I guess it would be of more use if you have some more Exo Force, which I don't"
p3880
aS' 6/10 Ups: Has great minifig, weapons and is easy to build  Downs: Crude design and a bit too expensive for what you get  (Brickshelf gallery)'

aS" I couldn't find a review of this wonderful set in here, so here it goes! I got the set for MSRP (180kr = 24 euro) which is a fair price here in Denmark"
p3934
aS' As all other Creator sets there are instructions for several models (3 in this case)  The box The box is a little larger than City sets in the same price range'
p3935
aS' The primary model is shown on the front while you see the secondary ones on the back'
p3936
aS' What you get 312 pieces in 5 polybags and two building instructions: one for the primary model and the other for the rest'
p3937
aS' The built It was impossible for me to speed build this model because of the nifty functional details from the retractable landing gear to the wings that can turn by means of the handle in the back of the model'
p3938
aS' It took me a full hour to build it because I had to "test" how it all works together'
p3939
aS" The finished model The landing gear isn't fully enclosed when retracted and the models are sub-minifig scale, but I still love the design of the models"
p3940
aS' The doors for the rear wheels open as you pull the wheels down and the final piece of functionality comes from the wings that can either tilt (the horizontal stabilizers) or have elevators'
p3941
aS' Wing in, wings out, wings in, wings out    Ratings As a whole I actually like this set even more than the Big Rig'
p3942
aS' The models are just as diverse but the added functionality makes the plane more fun to play with than the rig'
p3943
aS' Price: 7/10 - A good price, but not a bargain as the Big Rig Design: 9/10 - There could have been a sligtly higher level of details in the main model, but all models are really good looking and I especially like the design of the hovercraft'
p3944
aS' Functionality: 10/10 - I guess you could ask for working rudders, opening cockpit and so on, but the plane is really filled with movable parts and the turning of the wings works really well'
p3945
aS' Secondary models: 7/10 - A hovercraft! How awesome is that!? If only the last model was just as inventive instead of a standard helicopter  '
p3946
aS" Modifiability: 8/10 - The bricks are in ordinary colours and there is a good variety of them giving you plenty of possibilities for MOC'ing"
p3947
aS' You can easily make the main model into something that looks more like an F-14  9/10 Probably as good as it gets for a Creator set in this price range'
p3948
aS' It is entertaining to both build and play with, looks good and the secondary models are worth building as well! (Brickshelf gallery)'
p3949
aS" Thanks! I was planning on doing this review but I have been a bit swamped lately  :-$ Great review of a great set  It isn't too hard to convert the plane to Mini-fig size either"

aS" Thank you Sinner for bringing the pictures of the hovercraft  I think it is a really cool model, but The steering wheel doen't work too well"

aS" It doesn't turn easilly all the way around and when the craft turns, it doesn't stay stable on the three wheels because the front wheel turns quite alot into the opposite side"
p3981
aS" Now to the third model! This is quite a basic helicopter with the functionality of having the rotors turning  It doesn't use that many of the bricks and doesn't even have a landing gear"

p4087
aS' Includes Spider-Man, Nova, Dr  Doom, Beetle and J  Jonah Jameson with accessories and weapons'
p4088
aS" The first thing that comes to mind after reading this description is: Wow, that's a lot of TMs! Anyway, here are some resource links for this set: Brickset Bricklink Rebrickable The Box Since this set is based on the Ultimate Spider-Man cartoon, the box has the usual USM design with the red Marvel Super Heroes background, an illustration of Spidey in the upper right corner, and the USM logo in the lower right"
p4089
aS' As usual, there is a minifig line up in the lower left, and since this was before the terrible redesign, you can see the full body of the minifigs  I really miss this type of line up'
p4090
aS' There is quite a lot going on here: Doctor Doom attacking the Daily Bugle in his jet while simultaneously reaching for J'
p4091
aS" Jonah Jameson below with his jet's claw, Spider-Man (reluctantly) swings in to save him, while Nova fights off the Beetle  It's a pretty cool scene, even though it's not very accurate to the show"
p4092
aS' In "Beetle Mania", the episode that this set is based on, the Beetle was indeed out to kill JJJ, but it was in order to stop him from exposing his identity, not Spider-Man\'s (although Spidey was next on JJJ\'s list)'
p4093
aS" And while he is a recurring villain on the show, Doctor doom had nothing to do with this plot and didn't even appear in the episode aside from a brief cameo"
p4094
aS" It's awesome that they included him anyway, though, so I'm not gonna complain  Note that the tower is so tall that it wraps around the top of the box"
p4095
aS' There, you can also see a scale reference with the Spider-Man minifig'
p4096
aS' On the back of the box, you can see the interior of the Bugle and all of its play features which there are quite a few of since this is a playset'
p4097
aS" It's all illustrated pretty well, although Lego's choice of sound effects is still a mystery to me"
p4098
aS' I don\'t get why they don\'t go for Spider-Man\'s signature "Fwip!" instead of "Fazzing!" and I didn\'t know that a breaking window made the sound "Btoom!" but I digress'
p4099
aS' Contents Inside the box you will find three instruction booklets (one smaller than the others), a comic book, a fairly large sticker sheet, five numbered bags, and two loose pieces: A white string piece and a gray 16x8 plate'
p4100
aS" There aren't really any notable pieces and nobody cares about the comic bock (no offense to the artist), so lets get right to the instructions  They are pretty straight forward and easy to follow"
p4101
aS' Some of the pages have a ghostly image of Spidey, Nova, and Dr'
p4102
aS' Doom in the top right corner which is fitting since these are all minifigs that appear in this set (which is strangely not something that can be said for many other Super Heroes instructions with this type of artwork)'
p4103
aS" Minifigures As with most Super Heroes sets, most people will get this set mainly for the minifigs, so without further ado, let's talk about them"
p4104
aS' Spider-Man is the same old bootless one you get in almost every USM set  Not much to say about him'
p4105
aS" Some might complain that we don't get Spidey's alter ego Peter Parker in this set, but in the USM cartoon, MJ is actually the one who works at the Daily Bugle, not Peter"
p4106
aS' Curse the creators of this cartoon for ruining our chances of getting a new Peter Parker minifig by trying to mix things up  Next we get J  Jonah Jameson'
p4107
aS' He appeared in a Spider-Man 2 set before, but this is a complete redesign  He now has a blue suit with a red tie, a unique face print, and that combed-back hair in dark gray'
p4108
aS" This new hairpiece doesn't suit him at all and the old flat top hair was perfect for him in my opinion, so I don't know why they changed it"
p4109
aS' The good thing about this change, however, is the fact that this piece is exclusive to this set in that color  Nova on the other hand is spot-on'
p4110
aS' He comes with a new helmet mold and some nice torso printing  However, he, too, is missing his boots  TLC should have started making dual-colored legs a long time ago'
p4111
aS" Here are some reference images to compare them to  Okay, so JJJ's hair may not be completely black in the show, but I still think they should have given his minifig a black hairpiece"
p4112
aS' His suit is also not quite the right color'
p4113
aS' He rarely appears in person in the show (including the episode this set is based on) and is usually seen on screens around New York, so this is the best picture of him I could find'
p4114
aS' I guess I should be happy they included a minifig of him at all'
p4115
aS" In the episode, it was actually Mary Jane who was at the Bugle during Beetle's attack, so it would have made more sense to include her, but we got her in the Spider-copter set one year later, so that's ok"
p4116
aS" All three of them have back printing  In JJJ's case I'm using that term loosely since it is only comprised of two lines, but it's nice that they went through the trouble of adding them"
p4117
aS" Both JJJ and Nova come with angry alternate faces  It almost looks like they're trying to out-angry each other  Who do you think looks angrier? Let me know in the comments section below"
p4118
aS" Now let's talk about the bad guys"
p4119
aS" Even though he would be better off in a Fantastic Four set, it's great to finally get Victor Van Doom, one of the greatest Marvel villains ever and in comics in general"
p4120
aS' He comes with a dark green hood which was new and exclusive in that color at the time, and he is the only minifig in this set that has leg printing  Beetle is a regular minifig with wings'
p4121
aS' The metallic printing on his face and torso is pretty nice, but I wish it would have continued onto his legs as well  The Beetle looks quite accurate to his on-screen counterpart'
p4122
aS' The only thing that could have improved him is a new helmet mold with pointy eyebrows/antennae  Doctor Doom, however, looks nothing like he does in the movie'
p4123
aS" I just don't understand how Lego could have messed him up so badly  Maybe they were working off of early concept art or something  Here is a back view of Doom and Beetle"
p4124
aS" Beetle would be a pretty boring minifig if it wasn't for his wings which are awesome with their holographic texture  They are so mesmerizing, I could look at those things all day"
p4125
aS' This piece also appeared in trans  light green in the Galaxy Squad sets which came out at the same time  Here they are without their gear  As you can see, they both have back printing as well'
p4126
aS" And no, Doctor Doom does not come with an alternate facial expression, which is fine since you can't see much of his expressions due to his mask anyway  Here's a look at Dr"
p4127
aS" Doom and Nova without their headgear  Some say that Doom's face looks too cartoony, but I think it looks fine  Nova is wearing stylish goggles as a way of explaining his white eyes"
p4128
aS" It's a far better explanation than the Bat-sweatband  They did the same thing with the masked Wolverine later  Here are all the figs with their accessories"
p4129
aS' JJJ comes with a camera so that he can take "more pictures of Spider-Man!" Beetle comes with one of those overused ADU guns which is a very poor representation of his wrist-mounted blasters'
p4130
aS' I hate to say it, but even those bulky new stud shooters would have been a better representation of his weapons'
p4131
aS' Spidey comes with his usual string of webbing and Nova comes with some Iron Man style translucent studs  The weird thing is that they are red while his powers have a blue glow in the show'
p4132
aS" Doctor Doom sadly doesn't get any accessories, but who needs weapons when you have a jet with a claw and flick-fire missiles"
p4133
aS' The Build The first bag contains Spider-Man, a brick separator, and the parts to build the ground floor of the DBC building  After a quick and straight-forward build, you get this'
p4134
aS' The dumpster and street lamp are separate from the building and since the lamp post is not built onto any baseplate and is quite top-heavy, it gets knocked over pretty easily'
p4135
aS" Maybe it's meant to be that way, but I would have preferred it if you could stick it onto the baseplate of the building on which there is unfortunately not enough space to do so"
p4136
aS' As you would expect, the second bag has the parts for the first floor of the building  This is also the bag that contains Beetle'
p4137
aS" After another fairly simple build, you'll find yourself with a two story building with a spiderweb one side and a fire escape on the other"
p4138
aS" However, you have to apply three stickers during this section of the build which is never fun  Can you guess what's in bag number 3? Yup, the second floor of the building"
p4139
aS" You don't need superpowers to predict that one  Also, this bag contains Nova and Jameson"
p4140
aS' The build of this section is a bit repetitive since the second floor is mostly the same as the first and it takes slightly longer to build since you have to build the rooftop as well'
p4141
aS' Also, in addition to the two window stickers you have to apply ten 2x2 tile stickers! Trying to do this without having any of them being crooked is a real pain in the megablocks'
p4142
aS" The next bag contains Doctor Doom and the cockpit of his jet  Doom's cape is in the usual square white box and the string for the claw is folded up in a piece of tape"
p4143
aS" Here's what you get at the end of this section  Looks more like an escape pod than a jet at this point  The final bag is the smallest as it only includes the few parts needed to finish the Doom jet"
p4144
aS" Once you build the wings and tail, you stick them onto the cockpit via Technic pins and you're done  Spare Parts These are the parts that are left over after the build"
p4145
aS' There is the brick separator of course, an extra antenna, and the usual little bits and bops'
p4146
aS" What's really awesome, though, is that they give you an extra pair of Beetle's wings! Considering what a neat piece this is and that this is the only set in which it comes in trans-black make this a very welcome spare that you can use in your customs"
p4147
aS' The Finished Set Here is the complete set  The DBC building looks quite tall, especially when you count the antenna'
p4148
aS' Comparing it to a screenshot from the episode, the general look of the building is there, although there are some inaccuracies'
p4149
aS' Aside from the fact that it is obviously way down-scaled, the screens that show JJJ ranting about Spider-Man should have been hexagonal, not square, and should have wrapped around the building'
p4150
aS" However, considering how many stickers you would have had to apply if they would have made it accurate, I'm actually glad they kept the screen mercifully small"
p4151
aS" Much like Doctor Doom himself, the Doom jet didn't actually appear in the Beetle Mania episode"
p4152
aS' However, it did appear in a later episode titled "Not A Toy" in which Spider-Man plays around with Captain America\'s shield, accidentally drops it in Doctor Doom\'s Latvarian embassy and has to try to retrieve it'
p4153
aS" And yes, that episode was as godawful as it sounds  Here's a screenshot of the jet from that episode"
p4154
aS" Like with the DBC, they managed to capture the general shape of the vehicle, although it doesn't look quite as good as in the show  The color scheme is too dark and it looks kind of blockier"
p4155
aS" Let's take a closer look at the jet  There is no real way to reel the claw in unfortunately  However, there is a stud on the back of the jet that you can stick it onto"
p4156
aS' Needless to say, this is not the ideal way of storing it  I would have much preferred it if they would have attached it onto winch instead'
p4157
aS" The engines on the wings can be turned, even though they don't turn in the show, and there is a flick-fire missile on each side"
p4158
aS" Even if it's not much to look at, at least it's a very swooshable vehicle  On top of each wing there is a tile with the emblem of Latvaria"
p4159
aS" There was no such emplems on the jet in the cartoon, but they are useful pieces that make it clear whose jet it is, so I'm glad they included them"
p4160
aS" There is nothing inside the cockpit except for a seat and unless you want to ruin Dr  Doom's nice dark green cape, I wouldn't put him inside of it"
p4161
aS" They could have at least printed a control panel onto that empty 2x2 tile  Play Features Since this is a playset, let's look at all the play features it has to offer"
p4162
aS' Like all playsets, the building is open in the back so you can play inside  On the ground floor, there is a potted plant and    nothing else'
p4163
aS" Seriously? Is this all they could come up with for this floor? They could have included a security desk, a lounge, a second plant, or anything else! As it is, it's just a boring empty lobby"
p4164
aS' The first floor is a bit more interesting  There is a safe, a swiveling chair, and a pin board with various pictures of Spider-Man'
p4165
aS' There is one tile that reads: "The true identity of Spider-Man" which is supposedly what the villains are after  I wonder how Jameson got this information in the first place'
p4166
aS' Speaking of Jameson, the second floor is devoted to his office where he can sit and yell at his non-present employees, demanding "more pictures of Spider-Man!" It also has a swiveling chair as well as a desk with a lamp and a computer'
p4167
aS" There is a Technic beam connecting his desk with the ceiling of the first floor which you can remove in order to take off the upper half of the building, but it's difficult to do, so I don't recommend it"
p4168
aS' As you may have noticed in the picture above, there are a few red pegs sticking out of the building  These are for triggering the play features  Most of them are on the roof'
p4169
aS' There is one on what looks like an air conditioning unit'
p4170
aS' If you place Spider-Man holding is web-string on the jumper plate in front of it and push the peg, Spidey goes bungee-jumping off the building'
p4171
aS' Wee! There is also one that sticks out of the side of the building which when pulled triggers a trap door  The third red peg on the roof can be used to pop off the DBC sign'
p4172
aS' Why is it called the DBC, you ask? It stands for Daily Bugle Communications since in this version of Spider-Man, the Daily Bugle is not only a newspaper, but a news TV station as well, one that promotes its own highly biased views'
p4173
aS' So basically the Fox News of the Marvel universe  I guess if you\'re an old school Spider-Man fan, you could just leave off the "C" and have it just stand for Daily Bugle'
p4174
aS' The sign above the main entrance wont be so easily modified however  There is also a peg between the first and second floor which when pushed pops out one of the windows on the first floor'
p4175
aS" The safe is only attached to a couple of jumper plates and has some jumper plates on top of it as well, so you can easily attach the Doom jet's claw to it and rip it out of the building as seen on the back of the box"
p4176
aS' There are also some SNOT bricks on the corners of the building that you can attach spiderwebs or Spidey himself onto for some wall-crawling and webslinging action'
p4177
aS' This is not so much a play feature as it is just a feature, but as I mentioned earlier, there is a fire escape on the left side of the building'
p4178
aS' This was a neat idea as it helps it feel like a building in New York City, but it is executed very poorly'
p4179
aS' There is no hole big enough for the minifigs to climb down through, so they would have to climb down the ladders from the outside which makes no sense'
p4180
aS' No wonder Spider-Man always needs to rescue people from burning buildings  There is one more play feature in the form of the dumpster'
p4181
aS' You can open the lid, put a minifig inside, and make them jump by hitting a tab in the back'
p4182
aS" Remember, this is before the introduction of super jumpers, but nevertheless it's a pretty strange place to launch minifigs out of  I guess even Super Heroes like to do some dumpster diving"
p4183
aS" You don't think this was funny? No? Well, me neither, but that's the type of humor that this show loves to use  Sigh  Anyway, let's get on to the ratings  Ratings Design: 2/5 - The set looks ok"
p4184
aS" Despite many inaccuracies, the DBC building and the jet somewhat resemble their on-screen counterparts and don't look too bad, but they definitely could be better"
p4185
aS' Build: 1/5 - A mostly unchallenging and repetitive build with an attrocious amount of stickers  Minifigs: 4/5 - Definitely the strongest point of the set'
p4186
aS' Some of the figs could be better, but four out of five of them are exclusive to this set'
p4187
aS" Doctor Doom is easily the best and probably the most desirable one - unless the Fant4stic movie portraits him so badly that nobody will be interested in him, but that's impossible"
p4188
aS' Playability: 4/5 - As you would expect from a playset, the playability is quite high, although I still feel like there could have been more  Parts: 3/5 - Not many rare parts'
p4189
aS" If you're looking for parts for building your own skyscraper with tan walls and lots of doors and windows though, this set is for you"
p4190
aS' Price: 3/5 - At 476 parts for $50, this set is a bit pricey, but it is somewhat justified by all the large window and wall pieces  Overall: 3/5 - This set is mediocre at best'
p4191
aS' Playsets are always a good choice for Spider-Man sets since they give Spidey something to swing from, but unfortunately they are rarely pulled off well'
p4192
aS' The jet is blocky, the building is bare-bones, and the price feels too high  The only reason to get this set are the four exclusive minifigs'
p4193
aS' This set was discontinued early this year, but if you still see it on clearance somewhere, go ahead and get one for the minifigs and parts, or buy multiples and use the parts to build a better DBC building'
p4194
aS" I hope you enjoyed this review  It is part of the Reviewers Academy's 7th Anniversary"
p4195

p4196
aS" I hope it's as fantastic as it promises to be! (2 hours later) I was wrong! I was horribly, horribly wrong!"
p4197
aS' Hahah, entertaining and informative, a great read- thanks for the review! On a side note I thought Fant-Four-Stic was    ok  On the poorer side of ok'
p4198
aS' The exposition felt like it was from a 3 hour film because it was so long and towards the middle it started to drag  The ending was terrible  Edited by Mutant Orc, 12 September 2015 - 09:53 PM '

p4425
aS' UCS sets should have a different iconography like they did in the past'

aS' The Manual: The gigantic manual measures 17? x 12? and is almost an inch thick  It is spiral bound with a cardboard like front and back and it is 314 pages'
p4428
aS' Interesting decision not to break it up into multiple manuals  It is almost unwieldy at this size and thickness  Unfortunately, the manual is not available electronically from the LEGO website'
p4429
aS' Hopefully, it will be soon  Missing were the little instructions at the beginning telling you to not build this beast on shag carpet and to sort out the 5,000+ pieces before you get started'
p4430
aS' I guess they figure if you got $500 to spend on this thing, you can build it however you want'
p4431
aS" As usual, we get the regular LEGO manual features: - Piece call outs for each step - Parts inventory at the end of the manual - Page numbers - Photos of all the other 2007 sets at the end of the manual Manual (paperback book provided for scale) Various manual photos (8x8 plate provided for scale) I'm about 2 hours into building and sorting"

bS"good review. *y* Me, I can't build it before Saturday. :'-("
p4459
tp4460
Rp4461
aS'Great review so far! I am looking forward to additional posts! As for the number of pins - from the Peeron inventory for the set, there are over 400 technic pins of various lengths! (insert the "my fingers hurt from building" emoticon) Keep the pictures coming!'
p4462
aS' The Build: The build is going quicker than I thought  I am sorting as I open the bags that I need  Some bags are in multiples so it is easy to pick them out'
p4463
aS' The build is a tad repetitive as the framework of the ship is somewhat symmetrical  Here are some progress shots: Note that two plates (1x4 and 1x8) are stacked in between Technic beams'
p4464
aS" Then the part below is assembled to hold the structure together  This took about an hour of sorting and building: I'll post another update tomorrow "
p4465
aS' The Minifigs: As you can see, the minifigs are really nice  They even throw in an extra fleshie head! No doubt these will fetch quite a bit on the Bricklink and Ebay markets  I?m keeping mine'
p4466
aS' Continuing the Build This photo shows how well this model is put together  Notice that they use four of the three-hole beams per side to hold this together'
p4467
aS' I remember reading that you can hang this model from the ceiling  I don?t doubt it  These right angle Technic pieces are used to reinforce the structure of the model'
p4468
aS' You can see them used here: I was shocked at how many light gray plates are in this set'
p4469
aS' I have TWO tubs full of these: The infrastructure is now complete: I got hung up for about an hour looking for one of these: Turns out, LEGO gave me an extra left wedge and shorted me a right wedge'
p4470
aS' So frustrating! I had to stead one off my 6211 Star Destroyer  It is not a very common piece by the way?'
p4471
aS'Hey nice review, im up to about the same point as you (page 70 to be exact) , tho i didnt have that missing piece thankfully! I think lego have done a much better job at packing the lego this time, i remember it taking me much longer to find pieces on the UCS ISD build'
p4472
aS' So I see they even do mistakes on these |-/ That beast looks really sturdy !! That is great !! Are these yellow parts new ? I am not a Technic fan and never saw these before'
p4473
aS' Another question for you: is the instruction book easy to follow, especially regarding the colours'
p4474
aS" Does the black rally stands out comparing to the dark bley and so on ? I sure hope so ;-) Can't wait to see moer hehe *yoda*"

p4476
aS' You don?t have the building crane 7905 either? Same color, same shape there: piece no  32555 (four of them included) I assume you?re not a town fan? :-P ;-)'
p4477
aS' I have been taking photos for this review for a few months and I finally took the rest of the photos last night  All the parts  If you want tan, this is the set to get! Main model'
p4478
aS' The garage is a great addition       but the car only just fits! The main house is very nice looking  The windows extend to the sides       but not the back'
p4479
aS' The chimney and drainage work very well, and I love the "basement"  I think the front works very well  When I was making this I was multitasking doing weight training; do a set, do a step, do a set  '
p4480
aS' and I ended up missing one of the row paths  I discovered this after I finished the basement  :-| The removable roof reveals BYO floors'
p4481
aS' Probably why this is called a Model house! The roof was quite interesting to build  This is my first large house set so it all was very new to me  I love the garage door  More nice pipework'
p4482
aS" This photo I mis-focused but there isn't much to see anyway! The door is a nice touch  The grill to the right on both sides is not just decoration as it hides the hinges for the door"
p4483
aS" I also made one of the sub-models  I was considering keeping this but I decided against it  Once again the sides have windows    but the back doesn't"
p4484
aS" The truck is there to make the photo more worthwhile! The roof to this one doesn't come off easily as all the tiles are used for the front"
p4485
aS" Just to clarify; these houses aren't attached so you can arrange them however you want"
p4486
aS' The fronts are quite elaborate and it seems that Lego were trying to make this almost like a simpler market street  The truck is too small for a minifig       but it probably was my favourite car'
p4487
aS' Thoughts I highly recommend this set  In most countries it is good value for money, including Australia  The design is excellent and three instructions are included  (The third is a school'
p4488
aS' If anyone has made it and wants to post photos feel free! At least one person at EB has made it ) I love how each house has its own car'
p4489
aS' Due to the way the primary model is made it is a bit weak at the corner, but that was a design choice'
p4490
aS' My only real complaint about this set is how Lego is going though a mould transition and thus some roof slopes are rough, others are smooth'
p4491
aS' I can accept either, and Lego has been moving to smooth slopes for years now, but to have a set with about 50/50 is annoying  (The MTT was the same ) But that is my only gripe with this excellent set'
p4492
aS' *wub*'
p4493
aS" Thanks for the review, and tons of pics! I've been wanting to pick this one up since I saw it"
p4494
aS' I thought the 4956 Creator House was nice, but this Model Town House is in a completely different league! I also like the alternate models that you can see in the catalogues '
p4495
aS' Thank you for the review Sinner  At first I wanted this set for the 4 blue 1x1 slope tiles, but I can see there is much more into it than that'
p4496
aS' It sure is a great value compared to what you get in the Building Bonanzas (no cars and less detail)  It was funny to see the little side story in your pictures'
p4497
aS' Would it be hard to modify the cars to fit minifigs better?'

p4500
aS' I found the use of parts well done by the designers  I made a car and then tried to make a house from a different instruction book  I could not as several pieces were already used in the car'

aS'the B model looks just as good so i might buy a second set, as you get the bucket left over and i need that bucket for another set  Edited by Richard Dower, 19 October 2015 - 04:42 PM '
p4600
aS'Remember when I said in my review of 7090 to expect a review after I went to ToysRus? Well, somehow things didn?t work out, but fortunately I?m finally reviewing my latest purchases, starting with 7091 Catapault Defense, which happens to be one of the best sets in the Castle line'
p4601
aS' The Box and Instructions: Lego box art is at it?s highest point ever these days, with lots of special effects and great action poses  The castle theme is no exception, and 7091 isn?t either'
p4602
aS' I?ll let the box speak for itself: I love the back of the castle boxes as well, since they give another action scene and other neat info like a layout of all the accessories'
p4603
aS' The Contents: Only the bare essentials as usual: piece bags and instructions'
p4604
aS' I seriously wish they still put mini catalogs inside sets like they did when I was young, but I guess they are too expensive to make or something  Ah well, can?t have everything'
p4605
aS' No picture of the instructions this time, but since that isn?t necessary I?ll just say that they are fine, and do not have a problem with distinguishing dark gray from black'
p4606
aS' The Pieces: Here?s your basic shot of every piece included, minus a few extra pieces like an extra Viking horn and black skeleton leg  Not too shabby for a 10 USD set'
p4607
aS' There?s a lot of nice pieces in 7091, as you can see (and this doesn?t include the accessories or minifig parts!)'
p4608
aS' The brown plates, wheels, and spoked things are always useful, and the dark blue and gold slopes are really cool  However, there?s also a fair amount of technic in here, so be warry'
p4609
aS' As usual for the castle line, 7091 has a heaping helping of accessories'
p4610
aS' Most of them are old pieces recolored, but the ball on chain (what?s the actual name, could someone tell me?) and the shields are brand new'
p4611
aS' I actually like the new skeleton weapon, since it?s fairly detailed and was really the only way TLC could make a part like that'
p4612
aS' And yes, the shields ARE printed (quite nicely too, if I do say so myself)  Plus, you get Viking horns (always useful to have), a grey boulder, a basket, and 3 helmets'
p4613
aS' Not a half bad deal, eh? Oh, who am I kidding ? it?s awesome! Minifigures: Ah yes, one of the highlights of any castle set  You get 2 soldiers and 2 skellies this time, all with different weapons'
p4614
aS' The two soldiers are just regular Crown troops with different faces ? nothing special, except that they are awesome anyway'
p4615
aS' The skeletons on the other hand are much more interesting: an archer and a black skellie! Archers cool, of course, but I know many don?t like the printing on the black skeletons'
p4616
aS' Well, let me say that I don?t mind it so much  The only real problem is that the eyes are dark red instead of just red, which makes the printing a bit less noticeable'
p4617
aS' And I?ve been through it before that the new skeleton molds in general don?t bother me at all ? go skeletons! The Finished Set: Alright, there?s two builds in this set, and I?ll start with the smaller: the skeleton barricade'
p4618
aS' Okay, so it?s nothing special, but it?s cool all the less  The shield on the front and the slanted spears are nice touches'
p4619
aS' Here?s just how the skeletons can tower over their own barricade: with a little step  Ah, the catapault  The lovely catapault  Seriously, I love TLC?s design'
p4620
aS' Very effective, and also very realistic, especially compared to KK  Love the side details and the swiveling base, and you gotta love the clever use of that basket'
p4621
aS' Playability: Yes, I?ve made it a tradition now to write stories for any castle set I buy (and this isn?t the last one, you can be sure of that!)'
p4622
aS' Here?s one featuring everything in 7901: Oh, and here?s a small ship I made out of all the pieces in this set plus a couple extra figures and weapons from my copy of 7901'
p4623
aS' Not half bad, IMO, considering what I had to work with  Overall Rating: Presentation: 9/10 Pieces: 8/10 Minifigures: 9/10 Finished model: 9/10 Playability: 8/10 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Final Score: 8'
p4624
aS'6/10 Once again, I highly recommend the reviewed set  Castle is possibly the best theme this year, and this set is one of many that prove it'
p4625
aS' As with all castle sets, it?s best if you buy several if you want to truly enjoy it, but this set alone is also impressive in both design and pieces and minifigures'
p4626
aS' Get at least one if you have even a slight liking for Castle  Edited by KimT, 10 August 2008 - 01:31 PM '

p4765
aS' These sets have been very popular, especially among AFOLs, and are always highly anticipated'
p4766
aS" However, while some entries in this series have been more popular than others, none has been as controversial as this year's set, the Winter Toy Shop, which is a re-release of the first Winter Village set, 10199 Winter Toy Shop from 2009"
p4767
aS" It seems that many think that this set didn't need to be remade and would have preferred a new set instead, or that it is not different enough from the original and will be redundant in a completionist's collection"

aS'99 S@H description: Quote Welcome to the Winter Toy Shop! The holiday season has arrived and the toymaker is busy finishing off his latest creations! Outside, children ski and snowboard, and a freshly built snowman sparkles in the light that shines from the toyshop tower'
p4772
aS' Help decorate the huge tree that stands at the center of the square, play with the curious kitten on the cozy wooden bench or join in with the carolers beneath the ornate streetlamp'
p4773
aS' This charming set also features a ladder, trees in various sizes, jack-in-the-box, a toy biplane, helicopter, rocket, train, race car, truck, robot, tugboat, teddy bear and a wrapped gift'
p4774
aS' Have fun building this enchanting winter wonderland! Includes a snowman and 8 minifigures with assorted accessories: a male caroler, female caroler, a woman, 2 men, 2 boys and a girl'
p4775
aS' S@H Bricklink Brickset The Box The box art of this set is similar to that of the original, but there are some notable differences'
p4776
aS' The Christmas tree is on the right side of the image this time while the park bench is on the left and of course it features this year\'s design for Creator boxes with the dark blue stripe along the right side and the "Expert" logo in the top right corner'
p4777
aS" There's also a small picture of the back of the toy shop and the background looks less cartoony than on the original"
p4778
aS' The back is also very similar, showing a different angle of the toy shop along with some close-ups, although this time there is no minifig lineup'
p4779
aS' Instead, the minifig lineup is on the right side of the box  It also includes the accessories that each minifig comes with and some of the toys'
p4780
aS' On the left side of the box there is a thumbnail of the box art and the set name in six different languages'
p4781
aS' They also want to make sure that you know that there are batteries included by saying it in dozens of languages'
p4782
aS' The top of the box features the inventory and a 1:1 scale reference with the female caroler'
p4783
aS" On the bottom there is a picture that reminds you that there is a light brick included in this set, in case that wasn't clear from the front of the box, and it confirms that yes, it is a bad idea to put it in water, in case you were planning to go swimming with your Winter Toy Shop"
p4784
aS' The Contents Inside the box there are two instruction booklets and two groups of bags, one for each instruction booklet'
p4785
aS" While two groups of bags is not as many as there usually are in other sets of this size, it's still better than the first version of this set where the bags weren't numbered at all, so this makes the build a bit easier"
p4786
aS' The large bag in Group 1 and the two large bags in Group 2 have a white stripe going down the middle of the bag and only have one group number printed on it along with some other number and some kind of scan code'
p4787
aS' I have no idea why they made this distinction for these bags or what that code is for, so if any of you know the purpose of this, please let me know in the comments below'
p4788
aS' Here is a random instructions page'
p4789
aS" As you can see, the building steps can get quite challenging as they sometimes include many different pieces in one step, especially when it uses a lot of brown pieces which are very dark and hard to see in the instructions, living up to the set's status as an expert-level set"
p4790
aS' Most of the time, though, the instructions are pretty clear and easy enough to follow'
p4791
aS" There are some parts in new colors in this set that weren't in the first version or any other set until now, such as that large, flat Technic arch in dark green, the jester hat in orange and blue, one of those new 2z2 round jumper tiles in brown, a golden frog(!), and a snowboard in dark blue"
p4792
aS" There are also some rare Friends parts that make their Creator debut here such as the skis in azure and that new clear 1x1 round tile with a tiny tube coming out of it which is usually used as a stand for Friends accessories and is a very useful piece, especially for SNOT techniques (and no, I'm not talking about the type of snot that many people usually have stuck in their nose around this time of year)"
p4793
aS' There are some printed parts as well, such as the clock tile, the letter tile, and the register slope like in the first version of the set'
p4794
aS' We also get a new face print for the white cat which is more in line with other modern cat designs  But the best part is the shop sign which is printed this time around'
p4795
aS' It features a lovely wood pattern, the words "toy shop", and a toy soldier on both sides of the sign'
p4796
aS" Which is ironic since the shop doesn't seem to sell any toy soldiers like this, but it looks so good on the sign that I won't sue them for false advertising"
p4797
aS" The Minifigs Let's start with the most unique figures in this set, the carolers"
p4798
aS' These two were also the highlight in the first version of the set, but in the original they both had the same head (this one -> ) which featured a very questionable facial expression that could easily be taken out of context'
p4799
aS" In this version, they have unique faces which look much better and help distinguish their gender  The male caroler uses Lord Vampyre's torso which looks quite snazzy on him"
p4800
aS' Maybe this is Lord Vampyre before he became a vampire? The female caroler is easily the best minifig in the set, though, because in addition to her exclusive head, she also gets an exclusive torso and skirt print! A huge improvement over the generic unprinted one in the original'
p4801
aS" She also gets the queen hair in dark brown and Aragorn's lined cape instead of two combined regular capes"
p4802
aS' This set truly is the Return of the Queen! The snowman is technically not a minifig, but as you can see here, he is exactly as tall as one and he is the first thing you build after the minifigs, so I included him here'
p4803
aS' He has mostly the same design as before, except this time he has robot claws for arms instead of levers  Which is good since they allow him to hold accessories such as his broom'
p4804
aS' His carrot nose is included separately again  The carolers both have back printing while the snowman looks no different from the back than he does from the front'
p4805
aS" Here you can see the black side of the female's cape  This lined cape is so much nicer than the solution they used in the original"
p4806
aS' Next up we have what I assume is a married couple who are likely the parents of at least one of the kids, as well as the toymaker who I will call Geppetto'
p4807
aS" The man in the pinstripe suit was not included in the first version of the set, so he's a bonus minifig! These guys are fairly generic, but they have some detailed torso prints, so they look pretty nice"
p4808
aS" Geppetto seems to have gotten younger since the release of the original set since his gray hair has now turned dark tan and he doesn't seem to need glasses anymore"
p4809
aS" The men both have back printing, but the woman is the only one in this set who doesn't get a back print"
p4810
aS' Why you gotta be so discriminating against women, LEGO?! Last but not least, there are the kids  One of the boys wears dark blue pants, a green jacket, and a wool cap'
p4811
aS" He looks a bit like a lumberjack, so let's call him lumberjack boy, or Jack for short"
p4812
aS" The little girl wears an outfit that wouldn't look out of place in the Friends theme with a lavender scarf and pants  I'll call her Lavender"
p4813
aS' The second boy is wearing an Octan jacket and a sports helmet which makes it ironic that he is the one not doing any winter sports on the box art'
p4814
aS" I'll call him President Business Junior, or PBJ for short"
p4815
aS' All of the kids have fairly detailed back printing which makes up for the fact that much like the adults, they are made out of mostly common parts'
p4816
aS" PBJ's helmet and scarf cover up the back of his head nicely which is important as you will see in the next picture  What's also great about these figs is that half of them have a double-sided head"
p4817
aS" Here you can see PBJ doing his best Macaulay Culkin impression  I also removed his scarf so you can see the printing on his torso better  But he's not the only one who seems to be easily scared"
p4818
aS' The mother also has a very alarmed expression  Maybe she got surprised by the Jack-in-the-box or maybe she just realized how expensive toys are nowadays'
p4819
aS" You can see the female caroler's back printing here  Her alternate expression is a non-singing face which is very nice to have and I wish the male caroler could have one too"
p4820
aS' She looks quite cute with those rosy cheeks  But the most adorable out of all of them has to be the little girl  She comes with a pouting sad face that will melt your heart'
p4821
aS" Please, don't cry! I'll buy you any toy you want, just stop looking at me like that! The Build The first half of the build is dedicated to the surroundings of the toy shop"
p4822
aS' It includes the Christmas tree, the park bench, the snowman, the toys, the carolers, Jack and Lavender'
p4823
aS" The large bag contains two smaller bags with small pieces, a white box that contains the caroler's cape, and the jester hat in its own little bag"
p4824
aS' The first thing you build after the minifigs and the snowman is the toys'
p4825
aS' This version of the set has a lot more toys than the original which is good because I always felt that the first Toy Shop was a bit light on toys'
p4826
aS' Also, the ones that were in the original have been updated  For example, instead of the two pairs of skis, you now get one pair of skis that use the new ski mold and a snowboard'
p4827
aS' The Jack-in-the-box is mostly the same, except it now has an orange and blue color scheme instead of the red and blue from the original'
p4828
aS' This change was probably not necessary, but hey, at least we get a new jester hat out of it  And instead of the brick-built teddy bear you get the new teddy bear mold'
p4829
aS" I have mixed feelings about this change because I actually kinda liked the brick-built teddy design and using a specialized mold seems to be going against the spirit of Creator sets, but on the other hand I can't deny that the molded teddy looks better than the blocky old one"
p4830
aS' Meh  The new toys include a tugboat which has some rounded Technic pieces as its hull, a biplane, a rocket, a helicopter, and a truck that cleverly uses roller skates for its wheels'
p4831
aS' These are all quite brilliant designs that feel like micro versions of Lego City sets and make a great addition to the set  Here is a back view of some of the more complex models'
p4832
aS" As you can see, the Friends accessory stand has been cleverly used to hold the biplane's fin in place and to provide a stand for the helicopter  The Jack-in-the-box has a hinged lid"
p4833
aS" The only thing that bugs me a bit is the T-piece on top of the helicopter that holds the rotor in place, but I can't think of any better way they could have done it"
p4834
aS' Next is the ladder that is used to decorate the tree which is exactly the same as the first version  The supports are on a click-hinge, so they can be adjusted or folded away'
p4835
aS' Then, you build the tree itself'
p4836
aS' You begins, of course, with the stand which is mostly the same design as before, but this time the plates at the bottom are brown instead of white and have golden studs as feet'
p4837
aS' Next, you build the first layer of branches'
p4838
aS' The main difference in this version of the tree is that this one actually has a brown stem rather than just a Technic axle on which you stack the layers of branches one by one'
p4839
aS' You wont be able to see the stem in the final result, but I like this change as it makes the tree more realistic  Then you add the second layer of branches'
p4840
aS" This one doesn't have lights/candles and attaches to the lower layer at an angle using the four trans-yellow studs close to the stem  The third layer is added  This one has lights again"
p4841
aS' Each layer is similar in that they are all made out of green plates that are built around a 4x4 ring plate, but they get smaller each time and are constructed differently enough for the build not to feel repetitive'
p4842
aS' With the addition of the fourth layer, we get close to finishing the tree  Lastly, you add one more layer and the tip of the tree'
p4843
aS" Now it's time to decorate the tree! However, it's not as fun as it sounds since that requires you to add lights to the two chains/ropes first which can get a bit repetitive"
p4844
aS" The clips holding the lights to the chain were white, but this time they're pearl gold which looks much nicer in my opinion"
p4845
aS' The next part of the build is the park bench with the streetlamp and the little tree  This is a fairly quick build with not much to it'
p4846
aS" The fishbowl helmet parts are a useful piece that you don't see too often, so it's nice to get them again in this remake"
p4847
aS' The design is pretty much the same as in the original set except for the wreaths on the streetlamp which use a green life preserver instead of a round 2x2 plate'
p4848
aS" This is another instance where they use a specialized piece instead of a brick-built solution, but I'm okay with that because unlike with the teddy bear, this part was not originally intended to be a wreath, so it's still nice part usage"
p4849
aS' The second half of the build is dedicated to the toy shop itself and includes the couple, Geppetto, and PBJ  Please note that there is a fourth 6x10 plate burried under the parts'
p4850
aS' You begin by tiling the floor, setting up the walls, and adding the interior items such as the fireplace, the cash register, and the toy displays'
p4851
aS' Next, you add the walls, windows, and the door and the ground floor of the shop is finished'
p4852
aS' So far, the build is the same as the old toy shop, except this time they decided to have the white stripes on the marquees be the longer ones instead of the dark red ones for some reason'
p4853
aS" I don't know why they did this and kinda would have preverred to get dark red 1x1 plates instead of white, but it doesn't detract from the look of the shop, so I don't really care"
p4854
aS' Now we begin with the upper floor  This is where things start to look a little different'
p4855
aS' Can you tell the difference? The difference is that this time they attach the roof using clip-hinges instead of bulky Technic constructions which gives you more space on this floor and allows it to look more like an actual attic'
p4856
aS" They even tile the floor next to the frog clock  Aftter adding the roof, the build is finished  The main roof feels a bit loose since it's only attached to the building by one side"
p4857
aS" I'm not sure if this was an issue in the old toy shop, but it's not a big deal  I just wouldn't pick the set up by the roof"
p4858
aS' What I do like is that they used double cheese slopes on the awning on the outer wall of the tower instead of singles which makes it a bit easier to build'
p4859
aS' I like how the supports under the tower roof now match those of the main roof  The wreaths have also been updated like the ones on the streetlamp'
p4860
aS' And those Technic arches under the roof look a lot more like garlands now'
p4861
aS" On the original, they were dark gray, so I didn't even know they were supposed to be garlands and assumed they were part of the architecture  The shop sign looks a lot better now that it is printed"
p4862
aS' The old one just looked like a white flag  I also like how the small plates under the marquee give it a wavy look and they included two trees in different sizes on the right side of the shop'
p4863
aS' The back is nice and open and allows you to see the rest of the toys, the robot, train, and race car, all of which have just as much of a simple and clever design as the other toys'
p4864
aS' The clock looks much nicer with the new golden frog  Because golden frogs make everything better'
p4865
aS' Spare Parts There are quite a few small parts left over, including a roller skate and one of those Friends accessory stands which will come in handy'
p4866
aS' The Complete Set Here you can see the full set together'
p4867
aS' It looks quite nice and festive with all the little details and there are many scenes that you can play out with it: You can have the minifigs decorate the tree, have the kids play in the snow, have the carolers sing by the bench, have the toymaker build some toys in his workshop, or have the parents buy presents for their kids'
p4868
aS" It's a festive, toy-filled Winter Wonderland! The fireplace looks cozy and I like the brick pattern going up the chimney  The entrance of the shop looks a bit empty aside from the cash register"
p4869
aS' I feel like they could have displayed some more toys here, but oh well'
p4870
aS" Being a set targeted at teens and adults, there aren't really any play features aside from the light brick which is attached to a hinge, so you can either activate it by pressing the button with your finger or tilting the brick upward so that the button is pressed against the roof"
p4871
aS" However, since the roof is not connected in the middle and only attached on the sides, it tends to split open a bit when you do that, so I'm not sure if attaching the roof this way here was such a good idea"
p4872
aS' Nevertheless, it looks quite nice when the light is lit'
p4873
aS' Ratings Design: 5/5 - This set is as gorgeous as it was back in 2009! The small updates that they made are mostly good ones, although the absence of a brick-built teddy is a bit disappointing and the new way the roof is attached, while not as bulky as before, makes the roof slightly unstable, but those are just nitpicks'
p4874
aS' Build: 5/5 - There are some interesting building techniques here, such as those on the tree, the roof, and the toys'
p4875
aS' The fact that the parts are only split into two groups and the part callouts can get fairly complex makes it a challenging, enjoyable build'
p4876
aS' Minifigs: 5/5 - They did a great job updating the figs in this set'
p4877
aS' While only 3 of the torsos in the original had any printing, all of the torsos have printing front and back in this set, even the skirt and cape of the female caroler'
p4878
aS" You get two exclusive heads and half of the heads are double-sided, plus you get 8 instead of 7 minifigs  You really can't ask for more in a Creator set"
p4879
aS' Playability: 4/5 - This set is more meant to be displayed than to be played with, but there are plenty of things to play with if you want'
p4880
aS" All the different minifigs, accessories, and set pieces make for endless possibilities for play  It's especially fun to swoosh the micro vehicles around"
p4881
aS' Parts: 3/5 - There are lots of good parts here  Most of them are fairly common, but there are some rare parts and some even in exclusive colors'
p4882
aS' Price: 4/5 - This set costs $20 more than the original, but considering that this set has nearly 900 pieces, including some rare and exclusive ones, as well as more minifigs with much better printing, I think $80 is still a fair price'
p4883
aS" Overall: 5/5 - So what's my opinion of this set? For a remake, I think it's great  They managed to make a good set even better  Are the changes minor? Yes  Are they an improvement? Mostly, yes"
p4884
aS" Were they necessary? Perhaps not, but it's good that they made them instead of just re-releasing the exact same set"
p4885
aS" So if you didn't get the first Winter Toy Shop, I can highly recommend getting this one"
p4886
aS' If you do already have the old version, this one might still be worth picking up for the hugely improved minifigs and rare parts alone'
p4887
aS' As for the controversy over re-releasing the Winter Toy Shop, I can see where the haters are coming from, but I find their complaints to be quite petty'
p4888
aS" I can understand if you're disappointed because you already have the first Winter Toy Shop and were looking forward to a new set this year, but there's always next year"
p4889
aS" If you're a completist and feel like TLG is forcing you to buy a set you don't need, you're wrong  Nobody is forcing you to buy anything but yourself"
p4890
aS" If you decide to buy every set in a theme no matter what it is, that's your problem, not LEGO's"
p4891
aS' So put down your torches and pitchforks and just be glad that they improved the set design and gave us another chance to buy this classic set'
p4892

aS' Regarding the reason for the different designs on the inner bags, I think that the white stripe is the new version, with the non-stripe version being old'

aS" I didn't realise there were quite as many changes as you highlighted (tree, roof etc) "
p4931

p4932
aS" Let's hope LEGO does continue to make the more realistic winter village sets (versus Santa)"
p4933
aS" I'm not opposed to a rehash, the post office could use some improvements for example, but this one is just a wee bit minimal "
p4934
aS' I missed out on the first one, but I love the improvements made in this version, like the tree having an actual brown trunk so it looks less like an artificial one, and the carolers as well'

p4989
aS" This set kind of reminds me to the 9394 - Jet Plane, although it's obviously a lot smaller"
p4990
aS" As you can read in my review of the 42052 - Heavy Lift Helicopter basically anything flying is +1 for me, so let's find out if this set also fits the bill"
p4991
aS' Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions'
p4992
aS' SET INFORMATION Number: 42044 Title: Display Team Jet Theme: Technic Released: 2016 Part Count: 113 Box Weight: 193 gr Box Dimensions: 15,4 cm x 13,8 cm x 5,9 cm Set Price (MSRP):  9,99 Price per Part:  0,088 Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX Being a small set, it obviously comes in a small box'
p4993
aS" The Display Team Jet is an Aerobatics Jet, used in air shows  On the box it's flying rather high, but at least it's at a safe distance from the crowd"
p4994
aS' Front side shows the main model, together with a small section indicating you can use Digital Building instructions to build this model  BACK SIDE The back side shows the B-model, a Stunt Plane'
p4995
aS' And again a reference to the apps for Digital Building instructions  More on the Stunt Plane later'
p4996
aS' CONTENT OF THE BOX The box contains: 2 Instructions Booklets (A- and B-model) 1 Sticker Sheet 3 Technic Liftarms 2 Bags INSTRUCTION BOOKLETS Both the instructions for the A- and B-model are included in the box'
p4997
aS' STICKER SHEET A lot of stickers for such a small set  Apparently no panel is left untouched  LIFTARMS Three liftarms unsealed, nothing out of the ordinary for a small set'

aS" YELLOW 5L AXLES The 5L Axle in Yellow has never been released before, so it's one of the new parts for this year"
p5000
aS' BLACK 7L FLEX AXLES For the layman this seems a common part, but the 7L Soft Axle actually has never been released in black before'
p5001
aS' Combined with the re-release of the 19L Soft Axle in black, this will open up lots of possibilities'
p5002
aS" For those of you thinking you've read this text before; you are right, the new Drag Racer contains these new 7L Flex Axles too  WHITE PANELS This small set comes with a whopping 10 panels"
p5003
aS' Great for the ones who like panels  Not so great if you think TLG is using too much panels lately'
p5004
aS" RUDDER This part, the Small Bionicle Wing, is the same as the one used in last year's 42033 - Record Breaker  PART LIST This set contains 113 parts, all listed below"
p5005
aS' THE BUILD This is the collection of parts, used to build the Jet  It sure looks like we are getting a landing gear  The build is fun, but pretty straightforward'
p5006
aS" There aren't any special or cool techniques used in this set  It almost took me more time to apply all the stickers than to build the actual model"
p5007
aS' FINISHED MODEL The finished Jet does look cool though  The white and yellow color scheme, combined with the stickers, work really well'
p5008
aS" I have seen people refer to the plane as being orange, but it's definitely yellow  Technic (or LEGO in general) tends to have some color variation when it comes to yellow"
p5009
aS" I do concur this is the warmer variant of yellow, but it's not orange  The back of the plane looks nice too, although I am not a big fan of the rudder part"
p5010
aS" It looks too detailed, compared to the other panels  It's not a big deal though, and maybe it's just me  PARTS LEFT Only three common parts left"
p5011
aS" FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS This set has a single feature and that is a retractable landing gear  It's operated by the black 12T Double Bevel Gear near the cockpit"
p5012
aS' In the following picture you can see the landing gear retracted  This image shows the landing gear when the plane is ready for landing'
p5013
aS" Hopefully the pilot will roll the plane before landing, but you probably know what I mean VIDEO Here's s short video demonstrating the Display Team Jet"
p5014
aS' B-MODEL This set also includes the building instructions for the B-model, a Stunt Plane  The building experience for the Stunt Plane is more or less the same as for the Jet'
p5015
aS' Well, what do you expect when both models are planes with a limited number of parts  For an alternative model the Stunt Plane looks fine'
p5016
aS" There's not a lot of functionality in this plane, but it's worth mentioning that the tail wheel allows the plane to roll on a flat surface  The plane also has working propellors"
p5017
aS' Both functions are demonstrated in the video  Unfortunately, the landing gear of the Stunt Plane is not retractable'
p5018
aS" PARTS LEFT A couple of extra leftover parts, but it's nice to see that most of the parts have been used in the B-model as well  Actually, there's probably an extra yellow Technic Smooth 1/2 Bush left"
p5019
aS" I just found it on my desk, but it could belong to one of the other sets  VIDEO Here's a video demonstrating the Stunt Plane  SUMMARY Two nice planes for 13 bucks, that's basically what you get"
p5020
aS' Both models look good and the set has some interesting new parts  Especially the 7L Flex Axle will be very popular'
p5021
aS' It comes with a decent collection of white panel, although they are very common nowadays'
p5022
aS' Both models have limited functionality, but each of them has at least one function to give the model some playability for kids, other than the swooshability that is'
p5023
aS' Okay, it might lack some proper functions, but I still think kids will love this set  I can see kids running around with one of the planes in their hands'
p5024

aS' Obviously a set like this, cannot be compared with a Mercedes flagship  8 DESIGN For a small set, the model looks very authentic  7 BUILDING EXPERIENCE No surprises'

p5028
aS" While I can see kids enjoying this, I'm not sure I would buy  The flex axles are nice, and it is a decent number of white panels but I think I would get better return out of a larger parts set"
p5029
aS' Fantastic review though, and your pictures show off this tiny model better than the box art does '

p5140
aS' IMG_5344 by JJ2Sam, on Flickr First I added some beams to the wings and top to make it less hollow, second I put some navigation lights on it, I made the nose a bit wider and added a control panel, and lastly I changed out the landing gear wheels to more appropriate ones'
p5141
aS' IMG_5349 by JJ2Sam, on Flickr More pictures are HERE'
p5142
aS"Thats a cool little mod, two small nigles though, 1, your navigation lights are flipped on the main wings, 2, the panels on the tail i *think* were supposed to be the intakes for the jet engine, by using them to close up the tail you've turned it into a glider Cant wait untill i find one of these on shelves!"
p5143
aS' So this set showed up in stores yesterday, and i immediately picked two up'
p5144
aS' All in all it is a nice set, but it is slightly different from what i was expecting, the plane feels a bit "flat", pointy nose, wide bottom etc '
p5145
aS' And while the panels work very well as wings, it feels a bit simplistic to just have single-part wings  The stickers really work for it though'

aS' REVIEW - 42046 - GETAWAY RACER INTRODUCTION Starting with the 42010 - Off-road Racer and 42011 - Race Car in 2013, TLG released two sets in the first half of each year, using a pullback motor'
p5156
aS' The pullback motor allows the model to be pulled back, followed by forward motion'
p5157
aS" Usually there's no apparent relation between the two set, other than the ability to combine them into an alternate build  This year there seems to some sort of Cops and Robbers scene going on"
p5158
aS" A Getaway Racer and a Police Interceptor  That can't be a coincidence  Makes you wonder who will be victorious, the good guys or the bad guys"
p5159
aS" Let's find out! Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions"
p5160
aS" SET INFORMATION Number: 42046 Title: Getaway Racer Theme: Technic Released: 2016 Part Count: 170 Box Weight: 302 gr Box Dimensions: 26,0 cm x 13,8 cm x 5,9 cm Set Price (MSRP):  19,99 Price per Part:  0,118 Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX The box has the same dimensions as previous year's pullback motor sets"
p5161
aS" In the lower right corner there's a visual explanation of the pullback mechanism  The dark model with it's decals sure looks like a cool hot rod"
p5162
aS' CONTENT OF THE BOX The box contains: 1 Instructions Booklet 1 Sticker Sheet 2 Technic Liftarms 1 Pullback Motor 3 Bags INSTRUCTION BOOKLET Just a single booklet'
p5163
aS' Unfortunately no booklet for the alternate model  STICKER SHEET The sticker sheet contains a lot of cool stickers with flames and skulls etc'
p5164
aS' PULLBACK MOTOR AND LIFTARMS The pullback motor and two liftarms are found unbagged  BAGS A total of three bags containing the majority of the parts'
p5165
aS" HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This section describes the new and/or otherwise interesting parts  Actually, this set is the only set of 1H 2016 which doesn't use any new parts, not even parts in a new color"
p5166
aS' TIRES The Getaway Racer uses four low profile tires (Tire 37 x 22 ZR)  RIMS The rims are Wheel 30 4mm D  x 20mm in Pearl Gold, found in 12 other sets'
p5167
aS" PANELS This set contains three #3 Panelsand three #4 Panels in black  PART LIST This set contains 171 parts, all listed below  THE BUILD This being a small model, I won't show any building steps"
p5168
aS" Let's skip right to the finished model  Below you can see the end result  In my opinion the model looks great  It's got that hot rod vibe going on and the stickers add darkness to the vibe"
p5169
aS" Slight problem with this set is that it really needs the stickers to finish the look  Otherwise it's quite dull, with black and dark grey liftarms and panels"
p5170
aS' The rear view shows the pullback motor connected directly to the rear axle  In this image you can also clearly see the exhaust pipes on the side, which are very well executed'
p5171
aS' The 3x3 Technic Discs with stickers, used in the rim, result in only seeing a part of the rim  This works very well with the golden rims  The bottom view shows the chassis of the car'
p5172
aS' Nothing really noteworthy, as you would expect from a pullback set  VIDEO The following video gives you an overview of the finished model  PARTS LEFT These six parts are left after building the model'
p5173
aS' Seems about right  FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS This being a pullback motor set, it only has a single feature  The video below demonstrates the acceleration of the vehicle'
p5174
aS' My girlfriend was kind enough to catch the model before it fell to the ground  Or did it hit something before it fell to the ground?! VIDEO This video shows the pullback functionality'
p5175
aS' B-MODEL The alternate model is a combined build with the Police Interceptor, which you can see on the back of the box'
p5176
aS" Unfortunately the instructions for the combined B-model are not included, so I didn't get a chance to build it  This would make for a fun challenge, building the B-model without the instructions"
p5177
aS" SUMMARY Pullback sets are not the most technically advanced models, so you can't expect any other functionality than hitting the walls in your house  However, I think they are very appealing to kids"
p5178
aS" The fact that this year's pullback sets form a duo adds to the fun  In my opinion TLG hit the nail on the head with the Getaway Racer and Police Interceptor"
p5179
aS" The Getaway Racer looks very badass, which is something you don't see every day in a Technic set  SCORE How do I grade the bad guy in this year's duo"
p5180
aS' 8 DESIGN It looks so cool, but it does need the stickers  7 BUILDING EXPERIENCE Nothing out of the ordinary  7 FEATURES Limited to the pullback-and-drive functionality'
p5181
aS" 7 PLAYABILITY Combined with the Police Interceptor, kids will love it  It does need it's Nemesys though  7 PARTS Collection of common parts  Gold rims could be interesting"
p5182
aS' 8 VALUE FOR MONEY Pullback sets always deliver a certain value  7,3 HIT IT! More image can be found on my Flickr page  Thank you for reading  I hope you enjoyed it '

p5302
aS" Well, I'd rather do a good, late review than a rushed review, so here it is  Name: Mine Loader Set Number: 42049 Pieces: 476 (I think) Price: $39"
p5303
aS"99 (I think) Minifigs: 0 Theme: Technic Year of Release: 2016 Links: Bricklink Brickset The Box Another standard Technic box, not that there's anything wrong with that"
p5304
aS' It is a littler weird that the mine loader is shown OUTSIDE the mine, but whatever  The Back of the Box Again, very standard'
p5305
aS" It's oddly technical, showing the exact angle of the machine when turning, but that's the sort of nerdy detail that Technic people like"
p5306
aS' The alternate Mine Cutting Machine model looks interesting and unusual as well  The 1:1 Part The 1:1 part on the top of the box is especially helpful with this set'
p5307
aS" These mining machines are very oddly proportioned, since they need to fit in mine tunnels, so it's hard to judge the model size based on the wheels or seat like you can an ordinary set"
p5308
aS' The Contents You get manuals for both models (a single book for the B and two books for the main), a medium size sticker sheet, 4 bags, and 4 loose tires'
p5309
aS' The Special Parts This set has 4 of the new mudguard panels in yellow, two cylinder halves in red (a new color), some of the new color red and yellow axles, a couple of the new-ish Technic spacers, some of the axle-pin combination pieces, and a couple swords! I\'m pretty sure that\'s "an antenna" and a spare'

aS" The Start of the B-Model Since I like the main model better, I'm building the alternate first, so that's how I'll write the review"
p5311
aS' There\'s "power" for something (probably the engine) being taken off the one axle here'
p5312
aS' Overall, a pretty standard Technic frame beginning with some structural beams, a frame, and using liftarms to support axles out to the sides'
p5313
aS" More of the Frame The far end of the model has some obvious steering mechanism being formed, as well as a pivoting arm right in the center that's probably the connection from the Hand of God knob"
p5314
aS" The Steering Yup  Called it  Oddly, there is a different turning radius between right and left right now  I wonder if that'll get fixed    More Mechanisms That's looking more Technic now"

aS' Sad to see a u-joint being used just as a fixed straight connection like that, but it is the alternate model  '
p5316
aS" The Engine Block Because all engines should be enclosed in a red cylindrical housing, am I right? The Chassis It's definitely coming together now"
p5317
aS' And yes, the B-model instructions tell you to put the stickers on'
p5318
aS" It doesn't matter whether you build the main or alternate first, you'll get the stickers on (almost - there were a couple leftover that didn't get used in the B-model)"
p5319
aS' Almost Done With the rest of the body done and the wheels on, you really get the scale of this machine  That blue seat is tiny compared to the rest of it! And yes, the uneven steering lock got fixed'
p5320
aS' After putting the wheels on, you add a couple of "pin with ball" pieces to the underside to restrict the steering'
p5321
aS" They didn't do that at first so that you could turn the axles sharper while putting the wheels on, which made it easier to do"
p5322
aS' The Grinder Keeping in mind the scale of the machine, this thing looks terrifying! The tan gear at the back drives the spinning blade up front'
p5323
aS" The red bushes near the turntable let you adjust the angle  All Done The arm quickly attaches to the body and it's done"
p5324
aS" Sadly, that tan gear doesn't connect to anything - it's just a knob so you can spin the blade by hand  Raise Your Hand, If You're Sure    (I think I'm dating myself with that title  "
p5325
aS") This thing has massive reach  I'm imagining this inside a mine, grinding away the rock overhead"
p5326
aS' Pretty viciously effective machine! The crank on this side of the model is used to raise and lower the arm  Works well, and the grey spacer makes it nice to use since it spins freely'
p5327
aS' The Leftovers Not much left for a B-model'
p5328
aS' Nice usage! Starting the Main Model The main model starts similarly to the alternate, with a frame, some axles, and a drive connection from one axle to something later'
p5329
aS" Getting Complicated Already We're only a few pieces in and we already have three separate gear trains going on  There's the axle driving the tan beveled gears inside the frame at the bottom"
p5330
aS" There's more tan gears in the middle, and there's also a black gear sticking up as a knob that turns the grey connector in the center"
p5331
aS' The Body is Done I skipped ahead quite a bit, but it was a bunch of standard Technic building'
p5332
aS" You've got a fake engine with fan at the back, driven by one of the rear wheels, a knob sticking up for steering, and an axle coming forward to open and close the claw"
p5333
aS' The Claw! I like that they used a link system to open and close the claw instead of just gearing it'
p5334
aS" The axle comes forward from the chassis (it's the red axle) with a couple u-joints for flexibility and drives a worm gear  That rotates a gear below with a 2 stud liftarm on each side"
p5335
aS" Those arms have pin with towball in them and then a link going from that short liftarm to the claw  It's a small rotation of the liftarm, but makes the claw open widely and works very well"
p5336
aS' Raising the Claw A few black liftarms join the claw to the body of the loader and allow it to move up and down'
p5337
aS" It's a simple mechanism there - one yellow beam goes back and connects to a lever that lets you raise and lower the claw"
p5338
aS" When raised (as shown), the lever locks in place by going just slightly past the centerline  And It's Done Add some wheels, a cab, and some wheel arches and we're done"
p5339
aS" It's a great looking machine, pretty unique, and looks like the real thing  The main difference from reality is these usually have a scoop for moving loose rock"
p5340
aS" Since we've had so many scooping vehicles in the past (tracked loaders, the Volvo L350F, excavators, etc) the claw here is a fun change and adds to the playability for kids"
p5341
aS' Like the real thing, the body stays very low so the cab only has to stick up a little bit for the driver to see all around, because mines are cramped and busy areas  From the Rear This angle is great'
p5342
aS' I love the use of the new mudguard panels to make a nice curve to the back of the loader  The antenna is a little weird, but perhaps they had a big pile of flat silver fencing swords to use up'
p5343
aS' The black gear just to the left of the antenna is the claw control  Rotating that gear opens and closes it'
p5344
aS' The back end is a little lighter than a real machine would be, but Lego wanted to leave the engine exposed so you can see the cylinders moving'
p5345
aS" The Conclusion So, what's my conclusion on this model? I like it a lot  It's simpler than a big set would be, but it's got lots of design and playability crammed in a mid-sized set"
p5346
aS" It's a unique vehicle  However, it does have a few flaws  The steering on the main model needs some drag added"
p5347
aS" As is, you basically have to drive by holding the steering knob since it'll bend if you push it from behind"
p5348
aS" I don't like the use of pin with pin hole as mounting points for the orange and red trans plates for lights, since they can turn slightly and be at weird angles"
p5349
aS" The antenna is unnecessary and in the way  But none of these flaws are dealbreakers or even big deals  They're minor"
p5350
aS' The Ratings Value: 10/10 - Less than 10 cents a piece, lots of useful liftarms and such, nothing too weird or single-use'
p5351
aS" Design: 9/10 - Looks very realistic for the size of the set, good functionality, not too dependent on stickers Minifigs: n/a - n/a Playability: 9/10 - Controls aren't perfect (loose steering, small knob for claw control) but very functional and cleverly done"
p5352
aS' Parts: 9/10 - Nice selection, although heavy on the standard yellow and black  Almost zero studded parts  Overall: 9'
p5353
aS"5/10 - It's a great intro to Technic set - a unique vehicle, good functionality, nice part selection, and decently priced  I like it a lot and plan to keep it around as a finished set "

bS"Great review with high quality pictures, well done!! I'm glad you took the time to do it properly. Cool that you have built both models. I agree with the mudguards. They sure look good on this model."
p5360
tp5361
Rp5362
aS' I was waiting especially for review of this set  Let me add few things about this    thing'
p5363
aS' It all will be complainging of person who works with these type of machines, so if you just want a unusual machine in your collection, ignore my complaining :) I see underground loaders almost every day, and believe me, this model would now work in the underground mine'
p5364
aS' First of all, its cab should stick out more from the frame  Each loader has cab placed out of the chassis, to provide better view for the driver'
p5365
aS' In this class of machine it would help a bit, but in low loader ones it is extremely important: This is the view from the cab of a low profile loader (looking at front - and yes, front of the machine is where engine is placed, because at least at KGHM all machines drive engine forward): Another thing about that cab is that seat and steering wheel/joysticks are placed perpendicularly to the machine chassis, to provide same view for driving forward and backwards'
p5366
aS' So another weak spot of the set  The model lacks of trans clear lights on the engine part, because all machines that work underground have same lamps on front and back'
p5367
aS' Another thing that comes to my mind is that warning light and antena would not live too long in the mine, becuase it could be torn apart by ramming into tunnels roofs'
p5368
aS' It does resemble shape of underground machine, but not a loader  Only machine that comes to my mind is something that are used for moving/placing hydraulic support jacks in tunnels'
p5369
aS" Sorry for poor quality, I didn't find better picture of it: It does have claw, four wheels and articulated chassis, but have much greater range of movement of the arm"
p5370
aS" Anyway, I'd give it at least 3/5 for overall look  Model itself, as a set, looks unfinished (or cut down on pieces after visit of an accountant  "
p5371
aS') For me it looks like engine part was built differently, with knobs for steering/claw operating sticking out from back'
p5372
aS' Claw needs almost seven full turns of the worm gear to close from opened position, and is rather annoing to use it in way it is built in this model'
p5373
aS' Bracket that holds bevel gears responsible for steering is rather loose, being hold in place by single 3/4 pin  On the other hand, the steering works very well'
p5374
aS' It seems that lack of differential will be more common in LEGO sets, becuase it is another model that have fake engine driven by single wheel (like in old russian RC cars   )'
p5375
aS' I am OK with that, but it is a pitty that this model has only R2 engine  Thing that I do not like the most in this model is how the claw arm works'
p5376
aS' First of all, it barelly lifts the claw of the ground, the movement could be much better'
p5377
aS' And it has major design flaw - universal joints are not placed in line with articulation points, and this is main reason of 5L axle not being suported on both sides under the turntable'
p5378
aS' While rainsing the arm, it bends a little! I really would like to see this model built differently, with normal bucket and better range of movement  Edited by M_longer, 05 December 2015 - 11:08 PM '
p5379
aS" Thanks for the thorough comments! I agree that the set has some limitations, both in construction and realism, but I think they're acceptable given the pricepoint and size"
p5380
aS' The antenna is definitely ludicrous - I really do suspect they had a surplus of the swords to use up! And yes, the way the steering knob is mounted is loose'
p5381
aS" I also noticed that the u-joints to the claw are not in the right spot like you mentioned, but didn't include it since it still works fine"
p5382
aS' That axle coming forward to the claw has a very long unsupported section that does bend a bit when you raise and lower the claw'
p5383
aS" It works, but is a bit of a cheat that I'm kinda surprised they let through  I just checked and the bucket from 8043 is a couple studs too wide for this set"
p5384
aS" I'm betting that was seriously considered, but it'd have meant scaling the whole thing up and that would have put it into a higher price point"
p5385
aS' Or they could have pulled the mold for the 8x14 bucket back out and remade it for this set  '
p5386
aS" I really like the model you built! And that's interesting about the cabs being basically flush with the top but sticking out the side"
p5387
aS' In image searching as part of my research, I found both that style and ones like this, with the cab sticking up more (like the photo of the Caterpillar one in my review)'
p5388
aS" I wonder if that's a US/European difference, or different types of mining, or what, because both styles definitely exist in the real world "

p5413
aS' its so simple, a set close to 500 pieces with only 1 real function, and the entire rear section looks unfinished '
p5414
aS'Great review! One thing reaaaaaally bothers me about this set, both models have the engine connected to one wheel, the other wheel on the "powered" axle is just left to rotate freely, and that really bothers me, as it did in 42022 (on 42022 even more TBH, since its main feature is being a frigging car)'
p5415
aS' Looking at the pics it isnt even a space issue (as it was in the hot rod, where they "needed" to route the steering through), so they just cheaped out and didnt bother fitting a diff in there (or even a live axle link) Im not very interested in this set (not into construction stuff), but i think this is a worrying trend :('
p5416
aS' Thanks for review, mostlytechnic  Not a must have for me, but this set have nice assortment of parts    new turntable, new panels (i like yellow)'

aS"Lego 42045 Technic Hydroplane Racer Thanks to Lego and EuroBricks for making this review possible! This was supposed to be a preview-review, before the Dec 1 release date for the set, but it got stuck in customs or something and didn't arrive in time"
p5482
aS" Well, I'd rather do a good, late review than a rushed review, so here it is  Name: Hydroplane Racer Set Number: 42045 Pieces: 180 Price: $19"
p5483
aS'99 Minifigs: 0 Theme: Technic Year of Release: 2016 Links: Bricklink Brickset The Box Standard Technic box  Action photo, 2-in-1 logo, inset of functions  And the new "try our app" logo in the corner'
p5484
aS' The Box Back More standard stuff with the B-model and a larger app ad'
p5485
aS' The Contents 3 bags, two manuals (yes, despite all the ads for their instructions app, they included printed manuals for both the main and B models!), a BIG sticker sheet, and two loose black beams'
p5486
aS" The Interesting Parts There's a lot of panels in this set  Some are new colors (the blue curved panel) and the L-shaped blue panels are a new mold"
p5487
aS" I see them being used as mudguards on future sets (or maybe even this year; I haven't looked at the other 2016 Technic sets in detail yet)  The hose, soft axle 7 long in black is new as well"
p5488
aS" The normal 7 axle in yellow is a new color too, and I have no idea why it's in this set"
p5489
aS" Both models use it in invisible places, so there's no reason other than making it easier to grab the right length axle to have it  I assume other sets this year are using it, but I'm not sure"
p5490
aS' The Manual And the dumbing-down continues  Now they have to show people to compare axle lengths to the 1:1 prints on the page that have always been there'
p5491
aS" But how does the 1:1 work on the app? Might have to look into that    (for the record    I pulled out my phone and tried to find the app in the Google store  Couldn't find it"
p5492
aS" So then I went to the Lego website shown on the page and it had a link to it  Turns out it wasn't showing up because it's tablet only, so Google wasn't showing it to me on my phone"
p5493
aS" I'll try again later with a tablet   ) Starting the Build Two Technic standards  A bunch of pieces linked together to make a specific pattern of holes, and an engine block"
p5494
aS" Some Weirdness This felt very weird to me - making the crankshaft for the engine, they have you build it right to left  I don't know if it's because I'm a lefty or what, but it felt awkward"
p5495
aS" I need to look in some old manuals and see if it's always been this way    (nope! I randomly looked at 2013's set 42000 Racer, and it builds it left to right"
p5496
aS") Assembling the Core Here's the core of the racer, upside down  The engine block, some gears at each end, and a couple boat studs for smooth gliding"
p5497
aS" And yes, they cheated and those are only attached on two studs instead of all 4  I'm always amazed at how Lego geometry keeps finding interesting ways that it works  Like here, with those boat studs"
p5498
aS' They fit perfectly into the bottom of the brick and against the beam  The Front End Up front we get a standard blue seat with a couple "hidden" wheels behind it'
p5499
aS" A boat doesn't typically have wheels, but these will drive the mechanisms of this model, so we'll let it slide"
p5500
aS' An odd part choice here though - in the very front there are two tan "axle pin without friction" parts holding that 3 long liftarm on'
p5501
aS" Why? There's no need in either model for the non-friction pin, and there's lots of the normal blue axle pins in the set"
p5502
aS" So why include these two different pins? And All Done! It looks like a huge jump here, but it's really not"
p5503
aS' The front and rear connect to each other, and then a bunch of big panels are added that make the model look WAY bigger  The stickers on this set really make it work'
p5504
aS" Without them it's pretty bland and boring, so I recommend using them  From the Rear At the back we have a fan to propel the boat  That's not so accurate"
p5505
aS' All the images I can find of real-life boats use props in the water  But since this is a non-floating model, we have to make some tweaks I guess'
p5506
aS" There also should be fins going down into the water for stability and hydroplaning, but again, had to drop that  Here's an example of a real boat: You can see they nailed the overall look quite well"
p5507
aS" The Underside For those that want to see the mechanicals, here's the underside of the model  Minifig Scale Technic? Nope, not quite"
p5508
aS" A fig will fit the seat, but sticks out of the cockpit and can't fit a helmet at all  So close    Starting the B Model Again with the engine block, but this time an opposing 4 instead of inline"
p5509
aS" An Odd Part It's rare for Lego to include parts specific to the B-model, so I was curious when I found this 2-axle with pin, a fairly new part"
p5510
aS" In the main model, it's used in a place that a normal 3 pin would have been fine, and it's the only one of these in the whole set, so it obviously must be needed in the B-model"
p5511
aS" Sure enough, there's an assembly here that needs it: The Front of the Boat More upside-down building  And that silver piston is basically only there as a spacer  It has no real function  (Yet   "
p5512
aS" it turns out later an axle goes into it, so it's a support for one end of the axle ) Adding the Wheels We keep building around the engine  This model uses the same wheel setup as the main model"
p5513
aS" Taking Shape The B-model instructions tell you to put the stickers on in case you haven't - they actually did a good job making the sticker work on either model"
p5514
aS' But the silver piston used as a cross-brace is a bit weird  It can spin, so that axle hole on the side ends up facing whatever way it wants'
p5515
aS' The Back End The flex axles are used here under the panels just for appearance and to support the exhausts at the right angle'
p5516
aS' Same fan propulsion as the main model, and just as wrong here :) Worse, the gearing is switched  In the main model, the pistons and fan spin pretty quickly as you push the boat across the floor'
p5517
aS" In this one, they turn very slowly  More Instruction Weirdness I'm always curious at how Lego decides to do instructions  Here's how the panels on one side of the boat are assembled"
p5518
aS' For the mirror image on the other side, they tell you to put all 3 pins into the short panel as step 1 (2 black and a blue), add the white piece as step 2, and then add teh second panel and stickers as step 3'
p5519
aS" Why two different ways? All Done Here's a similar angle as most of the official images  Looks ok  I noticed though how obvious the wheels are"
p5520
aS" The back of the box image is a lower angle that hides them more  And I like the mudguard panels as seats  Pretty clever  From the Side I'm not fond of the profile"
p5521
aS" It doesn't sit level like I think it should  The wheels are a stud too low sticking out of the bottom  The Underside Like most B-models, there are compromises"
p5522
aS" There's pins and axles sticking out, but that's what you do when faced with a limited piece selection  Minifig Scale Yet? Nope, not quite  A bit too big this time"
p5523
aS' I think the driver is supposed to sit in the seat with knees over the front of the guard (where the grey pin is)  So the minifig is way too small  Spare Pieces Very few leftovers in this B-model'
p5524
aS" The Conclusion So, what's my conclusion on this model? The B-model is fairly meh, and too similar to the main model  However, I LOVE the hydroplane racer itself  It looks great and is very swooshable"
p5525
aS" For the price, it's surprisingly large thanks to the big panels on the sides, Yes, this is one set that really needs the stickers to look good, but they look great and are well worth putting on"
p5526
aS' The Ratings Value: 9/10 - Close to 10 cents a piece, and a fairly large model for the price  Design: 9/10 - Looks great other than the tiny fan on the back'
p5527
aS" Minifigs: n/a - I was tempted to give a score since a minifig almost fits, but that'd be cheating"
p5528
aS' Playability: 8/10 - Not much functionality other than the engine and fan spinning, but very swooshable and sturdy enough to be played with'
p5529
aS' Parts: 9/10 - A bunch of panels (including some new ones), just about every kind of Technic pin, and quite a few thin liftarms '

aS' Overall: 9/10 - The set is a solid winner, as long as your satisfied with the main model '
p5531
aS' Again, great review with superb pictures  The white and blue certainly works very well with your dark backdrop  Thorough review for such a small model  Small in size but great as a set'
p5532
aS' Tell me, why did I let you review this one?!'
p5533
aS' Quote And the dumbing-down continues  Now they have to show people to compare axle lengths to the 1:1 prints on the page that have always been there'
p5534
aS" But how does the 1:1 work on the app? Might have to look into that    (for the record    I pulled out my phone and tried to find the app in the Google store  Couldn't find it"
p5535
aS" So then I went to the Lego website shown on the page and it had a link to it  Turns out it wasn't showing up because it's tablet only, so Google wasn't showing it to me on my phone"
p5536
aS" I'll try again later with a tablet   ) Funny thing is that they changed colour of 7L axle to yellow, and on that picture it still is in LBG "
p5537
aS' Thanks for a great review! Too bad there is only one blue curved panel in this set'
p5538
aS' My opinion on the frictionless axlepins is that the flex axle might be easier to stick in them than in regular/blue axlepins  '

aS" Didn't actually try it though :-) Frictionless pins have accurate round hole, while blue friction pins have something squarish  Flex axle will fit in both, but using tan pins doesn't require strength"

Im a bit undecided on the set though, it has some nice parts (4 cil engine in such a small set!) and it looks good, but also a bit small and simple, not sure if it stands up to the standards of the small tracked loader or similar for sets of this size, and as a parts pack (for panels/flaxles) the display team jet is infinitely better'

aS" REVIEW - 42038 - ARCTIC TRUCK INTRODUCTION Arctic vehicles aren't new to LEGO  Back in 2000 the Town theme already had several small orange arctic vehicles"
p5578
aS' In 2014 TLG again released a number of Arctic sets in the City theme (formerly known as Town)  Some of these sets are actually pretty big, containing over 700 parts'
p5579
aS' Looking back in history it seems that Arctic sets may have found their origin in the Technic theme  Although these sets were white instead of orange, they are unmistakenly Arctic'
p5580
aS' The 1986 Technic Arctic Sets contained the infamous Technic Figures'
p5581
aS" Unfortunately the 2015 Arctic Truck doesn't contain any Technic Figures, but nonetheless it's great to see a new Arctic vehicle in the Technic line, not counting several snow scooters"
p5582
aS" Let's see if the new Arctic Truck lives up to the expectations  Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions"
p5583
aS' SET INFORMATION Number: 42038 Title: Arctic Truck Theme: Technic Released: 2015 Part Count: 1219 Box Weight: 2110 gr Box Dimensions: 47,8 cm x 28,0 cm x 7,2 cm Set Price (MSRP):  79,99 / US$ 84'
p5584
aS'99 /  59 99 Price per Part:  0,088 / US$ 0 093 /  0 066 Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX The box measures 47,8 cm x 28,0 cm x 7,2 cm and weighs around 1385 grams'
p5585
aS" The box actually feels pretty heavy which means it's filled properly  This seems to be a trend in the Technic theme  Slightly smaller boxes can save shelf space for retailers"
p5586
aS" THE FRONT The front of the box shows the main model and in the lower right corner there's a image with the dimension of the model  It's 40cm long and 18cm wide"
p5587
aS' THE BACK The upper part of the back of the box shows the functions of the main model  The lower left section shows the B-model, which looks very promising (more on that later)'
p5588
aS' The lower right section shows the motorization options for the main model  The crane (partially) and the bed can be motorized  Besides motorization some LEDs can be added as headlights'
p5589
aS" THE SIDE On of the sides shows one of the newer smaller style panels  This is the first time it appears in orange  When you take a look at the sticker you can see that it's not symmetrical"
p5590
aS' Not sure why TLG "cut of" one of the sides of the stickers, since the position of the panel is very suitable for a continuous sticker'
p5591
aS' CONTENT OF THE BOX The box is pretty densely packed, which is better than semi-filled boxes  It feels like you actually bought something which matches the box size'
p5592
aS" The box contains: 2 Booklets 1 Sticker Sheet 8 Bags BOOKLETS & STICKER SHEET Unfortunately the instructions and sticker sheet haven't been packed with cardboard protection, which results in a curved sticker sheet and slightly bent instructions"
p5593
aS" In my case this wasn't so bad  At least no real damage  HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This set proves to be a great parts pack, especially when you might have missed some of the 2014 sets"
p5594
aS" BLACK LINK TREADS Usually the Link Treads come in Dark Blue Grey, but this sets includes 96 Black treads, which is great if you'd like to replace the DBG ones in your MOCs, or other official sets"
p5595
aS' UNDERCARRIAGE AND SUSPENSION Several parts are included to build the undercarriage driving the treads  Four Large Tread Sprockets and eight Small Tread Sprockets, which are used as return sprockets'
p5596
aS' Also included are four Steering Portal Hubs and four Steering Portal Axles for driving and steering the vehicle'
p5597
aS' Several frames, including two C-shaped Pivot Frames and two Steering Ball Joints to create an undercarriage much like the 4x4 Crawler  The set even includes two H-shaped Frames (a k a'
p5598
aS' Dog Bone Frames)  NEW CHANGEOVER CATCH PARTS This year (2015) three new parts have been introduced to improve the changeover catch  More on these parts later'
p5599
aS' NEW PIN CONNECTOR Another new part for this year (2015) is the "1L Round Pin Connector", which looks like a pin connector, but acts more like a bush'
p5600
aS' NEW PINS Furthermore this sets includes quite a large number of three (relatively) new parts'
p5601
aS' 17 x Pin with Pin Hole, 14 x 3L Pin with 1L Axle and 11 x 3L Pin with 2L Axle, which have been introduced this year (2015)'
p5602
aS' When the new 3L Pin with 1L Axle was introduced in 2014 it was only a matter of time before the new 3L Pin with 2L Axle would appear  Both new Pins are a great addition to the parts portfolio'
p5603
aS" PANELS Last but not least this sets contains a fair number of orange panels, including the 3x11 Panel in Orange, which is the first time we've seen this part"
p5604
aS' PART LIST Below is the entire part list for the 913 parts  As usual this part list can be found at the end of the second booklet'
p5605
aS' THE BUILD The build immediately starts with some of the new parts, used to build the compact gearbox in the center of the model  Notice the two 20 Tooth Bevel Gears'
p5606
aS' One would have been enough to drive the 12 Tooth Bevel Gear, so the second seems to be useless  TLG probably used it in the A-model, because they needed it in the B-model, which you can see later'
p5607
aS' The front and rear suspension are almost identical  The front side also has the 13L Gear Rack, used for steering  The picture below shows the steering rack on the front suspension in more detail'
p5608
aS' At this point you have more or less finished the chassis  The gearbox is in place and the majority of the functions has internally been connected to the right gears'
p5609
aS' The small turntable shows where the crane will be attached later on  At the end of the first booklet, some of the bodywork has been attached to the chassis'
p5610
aS' The orange-black color scheme never fails to please me  Throw in some cool stickers for the extra effect and we have a winner'
p5611
aS' If you decide to motorize the model, using PF, the top of the cabin can be lifted to accomodate the battery box'
p5612
aS" The chassis uses lots of orange (and some black) panels to give the model it's distinctive look  The protective black bumber/railing is a nice addition which adds something to the exterior"
p5613
aS" The dumping bed at the rear can tilt to empty it's load  It's operated by a Mini LA"
p5614
aS' The Treads, which look very cool in Black, are driven by a Large Tread Sprocket and returned by two Small Tread Sprockets  The front and rear sections are identical'
p5615
aS' Building the undercarriages feels a bit repetitive, which is a problem for most tracked vehicles  FINISHED MODEL Adding the crane to the model finishes the build'
p5616
aS" Your model should look something like this  When you take a close look at the finished model, you realize this is something else  It's trully a unique vehicle"
p5617
aS" The color scheme is brilliant and the fact that it's an Arctic Truck is really neat  It's a welcome change for the Technic line to see a vehicle like this"
p5618
aS" This picture emphasizes that's it's a very cool vehicle  Imagine this beast plowing through the snow! As far as I know it's not based on a real life vehicle"
p5619
aS" If's probably a combination of several vehicles and some imagination  I can be totally wrong though  The rear of the vehicle shows the crane and drum, placed on the tipper bed"
p5620
aS' From this angle you can see some of the internals of the model, the gearbox behind the cabin for example  The crane can be partially motorized (rotation and base), while the boom is operated manually'
p5621
aS' What I like a lot is the protective railing around the vehicle  LEFT OVER PARTS Some leftover parts, nothing noteworthy'
p5622
aS" FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS This set has several functions/features: Steering Driving Suspension Crane Tipping bed STEERING As you can see in the image below the steering mechanism has quite a bit of negative caster (please correct me if I'm wrong), which causes the treads to rotate a bit upward/downward instead of only to the left and right"
p5623
aS' DRIVING You mention driving as a feature?! Yes I do and let me explain why  Normally I would ommit this as a feature and take driving for granted'
p5624
aS' However, driving this vehicle (on a flat surface) causes it to simply slide over the surface  For other arctic vehicles this would be a plus, but with a tracked vehicle it limits playability'
p5625
aS" This is one of the main drawbacks of these tread, they simple don't work properly on smooth surfaces  SUSPENSION The suspension is working properly"
p5626
aS" You do need to apply some pressure, but all things considered it's not too bad  CRANE The crane has four degrees of freedom: Base rotation Lower boom Upper boom Hook It does what it's supposed to do"
p5627
aS' Base rotation and lower boom can be motorized and switched using the gearbox, while the upper boom and hook are operated manually  TIPPING BED The tipping is operated via a Mini LA'
p5628
aS' CONCLUSION While the set does offer various functions and features, driving and steering is a serious issue  Therefor this set is more likely to be showcased than to be played with'
p5629
aS" B-MODEL Instructions for the B-model are of high quality  Looking at the image below, you will see what I mean  Here's the finished B-model, a tracked Jeep with a communcations device"
p5630
aS' This alternate model looks so good, it could easily have made it as a main model  One thing that does pop in mind; how would this look with tires?! More on that later'
p5631
aS" When you are in the artcic region it's imperative to have proper communication channels  Since there's no internet backbone, you will need a big antenna of some sort"
p5632
aS" This B-model actually features a small trailer wagon with a transmitter/receiver  Here's more detailed image of the B-model, without trailer wagon"
p5633
aS" I would buy this model in a heartbeat if it were a main model  Simply gorgeous  The side view doesn't give away that this in alternate model  The stickers also work really well in this model"
p5634
aS' And again, nothing to complain here  The model even has a small crane at the rear, operated by the Mini LA  Here you can see the arctic fleet, comprised of both the A-model and B-model'
p5635
aS' I bet these two can get some work done!! A bit of a messy picture, but this should give you an impression of the size of both models'
p5636
aS' LEFTOVER PARTS Not too many parts left, which is obviously a good thing'
p5637
aS' ALTERNATE MODEL WITH TUMBLER TIRES Just like me, you probably have been wondering how this model would look like with (Tumbler) tires  Well, here it is  As I imagined it does look great'
p5638
aS" Admittedly, these are not the type of tires we ought to use, but to be honest; I don't really care  Again, the negative caster results in quirky steering"
p5639
aS' The tires are a bit too big, so they hit the chassis when you compress the suspension  While this has absolutely nothing to do with an arctic vehicle, I really love this picture'
p5640
aS" SUMMARY We're almost at the end of my review, so what do I think of this set  Let's start with getting the Elephant out of the room; this set lacks proper driving and steering"
p5641
aS" Does that make it a bad set?! Definitely not! It's a great set, but it lacks some playability when it comes to moving the vehicle"
p5642
aS" The crane and tipper bed do work properly, so there's still some playability left"
p5643
aS" Does this set look cool? Definitely! I think it's one of the coolest (no pun intended) and most original models of recent years"
p5644
aS' The orange and black color scheme works great and the stickers are well designed  The B-model is of very high quality and some might even prefer it over the A-model'
p5645
aS' And if you are not interested in either of these models, this set provides you with a variety of great parts! All in all I think this is a great set! Maybe not to play with, but it scores high on all other criteria'
p5646
aS" PROS Original model Great color scheme Lots of interesting parts Great B-model CONS Steering and driving don't work too well Repetitive build of undercarriages (minor con) SCORE Below are my scores based on different categories"
p5647
aS" 8 DESIGN Original and good looking model  7 BUILDING EXPERIENCE Fun to build, albeit a bit repetitive  8 FEATURES Packs quite a few features  7 PLAYABILITY Some features work, some don't"
p5648
aS" 9 PARTS Comes with interesting parts  9 VALUE FOR MONEY Two great model in a single set  8 COOL! As a bonus, here's picture of the main model with Tumbler Tires  Why? Because we can!"
p5649
aS' Very timely review Jim  My wife has just surprised me by giving me this set a few days ago and I have just built the A model two days ago and B model yesterday  I agree with all that you wrote above'
p5650
aS" I don't have Tumbler tires but I have 9398 tires  Driving is smooth but steering + suspension will be bad as you said due to negative caster and tires hitting the chassis"
p5651
aS' Anyway, tonight I will destroy the B model and rebuilt this http://www busterhau   8-c-model html '
p5652
aS' I was supposed to publish it together with the 42039 - 24 Hours Racer, but it somehow got backlogged'
p5653
aS' After completing the reviews for the 2016 sets, I felt I needed to finish it (was already 90% done)  That C-model looks cool!'
p5654
aS" The set is a looker, you've got to admit it, but what it gives in looks does not make up for what it lacks in functions"
p5655
aS' I really wanted this set, badly even, when I restarted my adventure with Technic about a month ago  Than I learned more and more about what a good model can do, mostly thanks to this forum and YT'
p5656
aS" Right now I'm a bit disappointed with the Arctic Truck - smaller sets offer more functions and teach you much more"
p5657
aS' Jim it was a great review nevertheless Edited by pgplay, 14 December 2015 - 11:22 AM '
p5658
aS' Great review'
p5659
aS" I bought this model several weeks ago and the box has sat on my shelf, so I think after this I will be digging it out for Christmas and I expect my son will have a lot of fun with it when it's built"
p5660
aS' PS  these Tumbler tyres look amazing on this model, and indeed amazing in their own right!'

aS' Soon I will post an alternative model'

aS" REVIEW - 42001 - MINI OFF-ROADER INTRODUCTION Technic Mini models are sometimes regarded as models not worth buying  I don't agree with this opinion"
p5772
aS" Whether it's a special part or innovative building technique, almost every Mini model has something that makes the set worthwhile  This time I will be reviewing the 42001 Mini Off-Roader"
p5773
aS" This model is not a smaller version of an existing model, so there's no real comparison with a bigger brother, or sister if you will"
p5774
aS' Nor does the model resemble a real life brand or vehicle, so it is what it is, a Mini Off-Roader  Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions'
p5775
aS' SET INFORMATION Number: 42001 Title: Mini Off-Roader Theme: Technic Released: 2013 Part Count: 100 Box Weight: 165 gr Box Dimensions: 15,5 x 14,0 x 4,2 cm Set Price (MSRP): 9 99 EUR DE / 7'
p5776
aS'99 GBP / 12 99 USD Price per Part: DE 0 100 EUR / UK 0 080 GBP / USA 0 130 USD Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX The box measures 15,5 x 14,0 x 4,2 cm which is obviously not very big'
p5777
aS' The weight of the box is approximately 165 grams  FRONTSIDE The front of the box shows a though four wheel drive off-roader challenging a fierce rocky mountain trail  '
p5778
aS'now does it?! What the box actually shows is Mini Off-Roader challenging a small foam rock formation, much like rocks used in Star Trek The Original Series, yet smaller The box also states that this model is for the age of 7 till 14'
p5779
aS' More importantly, the 2-models in-1 logo is clearly visible, which means this set can be used to build two different models'
p5780
aS' BACKSIDE The backside shows a picture of the alternate model and a smaller version of the original model'
p5781
aS' The conversion arrow and the 2-in-1 are printed to clarify that the main model can be converted into a secondary model  SIDES One of the sides shows the 2-in-1 logo and a picture of the main model'
p5782
aS' Another side shows a picture of one of the wheels in actual size and again, a picture of the main model'
p5783
aS' CONTENTS OF THE BOX The box contains: 2 Booklets 2 Bags 4 Tires BOOKLETS This set contains two booklets which is not very common for a set this size'
p5784
aS' Both models share the same chassis, which is why the build has been divided over two booklets, one for the chassis (8 pages with 10 steps) and one for the bodywork (34 pages with 23 steps for the main model and 20 steps for the alternate model)'
p5785
aS' BAGS The box contains only 2 bags which is to be expected from a set consisting of 100 parts  One of the bags is filled with liftarms, panels, rims and two elastic bands'
p5786
aS' The other bags contains all the other parts, like pins, axles, connectors, etc  Opening the bags results in the following collection of parts, with the exception of the tires'
p5787
aS' No abundant number parts that will add real value to your collection  Nevertheless, there are some interesting orange parts and elastic bands  TIRES The tires are provided seperately (i e'
p5788
aS' not contained in the bags)'
p5789
aS' From the picture you can see that these tires have a front and a back side, so you should pay attention when fitting them to the rims, which have two different sides as well'
p5790
aS' HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This section describes the unique and/or highlighted parts'
p5791
aS' VERY SMALL SMOOTH TECHNIC PANEL (#21 AND #22) These two small Technic were new at the time of release and this set was only one of two sets containing them in orange'
p5792
aS" The other set is the 42007 - Moto Cross Bike  At the moment of writing there's a third set containing these parts, the Black Champion Racer"
p5793
aS" Side A Side B SMALL RUBBER BAND I was under the impression that these White Rubber Bands weren't that common, but it seems that these bands are as common as dirt"
p5794
aS" But hey, you can't have enough rubber bands! THIN LIFTARM 1x5 WITH AXLE HOLES Like the panels, these Liftarms were also new at the time of release"
p5795
aS' Looking at the the frequent usage in other sets, this part has proven to be a most useful mammal'
p5796
aS' THIN LIFTARM 1x3 Not a very rare piece per se, but if you are not into Bionicle, this liftarm part can be hard to find'
p5797
aS' Your other option would be to buy the 9390 - Mini Tow Truck, or the 8305 - Dual Bikes from a while ago (2000)'
p5798
aS" LONG PIN WITH CENTER PIN HOLE This relatively new kid on the block is currently used in many Technic and non-Technic sets and has well proven it's worth"
p5799
aS" AXLE PIN CONNECTOR HUB WITH 2 AXLES Like the previous part this newish part is also quite helpful in certain situations  PART LIST Here's the complete list for all 100 parts"
p5800
aS' BUILDING EXPERIENCE The build starts with the chassis of the Off-Roader  After connecting some liftarms two elastic bands, one on each side, are attached to the towball pins'
p5801
aS' This is all there is to the suspension, plain and simple  The two elastic bands contract the L-shaped liftarms, which results in the long ends swiveling downwards'
p5802
aS" The video below demonstrates the suspension  The simplicity doesn't do it justice, because it works like a charm  The suspension is very smooth with the right amount of stretch and resistance"
p5803
aS' This great working suspension adds a lot of value to this set  To quote John Hurt in the movie Contact: "Why build one when you can have two at twice the price?"'
p5804
aS' I have purchased two sets so we can simultaneously see both models and make a proper comparison  Below you can see two identical chassis which will be used for both versions of the build'
p5805
aS' At this stage we have arrived at the end of the first booklet, which only took about ten minutes  Not surprising, since the first booklet only has 10 building steps'
p5806
aS" Progressing to the second booklet, you need to choose between building the main and alternative model  That's a choice I don't need to make for this review, so let's start with the main model"
p5807
aS" MAIN MODEL When building the bodywork there's a rather peculiar building technique, which you wouldn't expect in an official LEGO set"
p5808
aS' The Axle and Pin Connector Hub with 2 Axles only protrudes halfway into the Double Bent Liftarm'
p5809
aS' The Thin 1x4 Liftarm which is added in one of the following steps makes sure the hubs stay perfectly in place, but I was still surprised to see this technique'
p5810
aS" The finished bodywork for the main model looks like    uhh   well     I don't know exactly  It doesn't bear any resemblance to a real life model, which makes it hard to judge"
p5811
aS" One thing's for sure; it's not the best looking Technic Mini Model  The bodywork can be attached to the chassis by using a 7L axle and two bushes, one on each side of the chassis"
p5812
aS" ALTERNATE MODEL Unfortunately the alternate model doesn't look much better than the main model"
p5813
aS" It's even a stud less wide, while you would like to see slightly more body, matching the size of the tires and chassis  Attached to the chassis the body is even more out of proportion"
p5814
aS" It's not really ugly and the color scheme is great (obviously this goes for the main model as well), but the body simply doesn't match the chassis"
p5815
aS' I can only imagine that this model is supposed to have a chibi look, much like the Microfighter Star Wars models'
p5816
aS' COMPARISON The following section shows a selection of images from different angles to compare the main and secondary model'
p5817
aS' The main model has a bit more volume, while the alternate model has a more sporty look'
p5818
aS' FRONT VIEW The main model has headlights which are attached at a higher point, while the alternate model has headlights which are placed more closely next to each other'
p5819
aS' REAR VIEW A slightly different setup in both models, where the main model again has higher placed rear lights  SIDE VIEW The side view shows that the panels are used differently in both models'
p5820
aS' The main models uses them as doors, while the alternate model uses them as engine cover (bonnet)'
p5821
aS' TOP VIEW The top view reveals that the main model might have room for a minifig PARTS LEFT The left image shows the parts which are left after building the main model, while the second image shows the parts left after building the alternate model'
p5822
aS" As you can see, the main model uses slightly more parts than the alternate model  FEATURES Besides the awesome suspension, which we already have discussed, there aren't a lot of features in this set"
p5823
aS" There's actually a single feature, which is only present in the main model    opening doors! Wow, impressive! Well, maybe we can't expect too much functionality in such a small model"
p5824
aS' SUMMARY The Off-Roader is a fun model which is fairly easy to build  The suspension is simple, yet very effective'
p5825
aS' The model could do better in the design department, but the suspension offers great playability and that is what this set is all about  The orange parts are not very common so they are an added bonus'
p5826
aS' All things considered this set is definitely worth the few bucks you need to spend on it'
p5827
aS' PROS Great suspension Fun to play with Some (semi) rare orange parts Great color scheme CONS No resemblence to an actual off-roader Not the best looking model SCORE Below are my scores based on different categories'
p5828
aS' 6 DESIGN Not the best looking Technic model  7 BUILDING EXPERIENCE The suspension makes it fun to build  7 FEATURES The suspension makes up for the lack of functionality'
p5829
aS' 8 PLAYABILITY The model has Car-Swooshability  7 PARTS Some interesting orange parts  8 VALUE FOR MONEY Great present for the younger builders'
p5830
aS' 7,1 ELASTIC Hope you enjoyed it! Thanks for reading and please rate this set at the top of this topic!'
p5831
aS' Once again, excellent review Jim! Than you for not skipping this small but pretty great set  I also got two of this and I have to say, I really admire the nifty suspension'
p5832
aS' Building a third bodywork for the same suspension system is still on my backlog '

aS" Here is the review   for Broadside's Brig 6259! A set from 1991, with a handsome count of 64 pieces, 3 figures, and a sale price of $8 75! The building(and parrot): We'll start off with the front"
p5876
aS" It looks like a good solid building to hold those scurvy dogs! We yonder over to the left side: And see a nice open back: And yonder to the plain right side: Back to the left, we find the corner, with a nice area to rest your tired soldiers! We see the platform in the corner, a lovely place for soldiers to stand on! It's a bit"
p5877
aS"skimpy, so watch your step! The middle is blocked by some stones, assuring security! But still open enough to stand in! The jail is cramped, and fits only TWO people, but we only need one prisoner in this set :-) ! Moving up is the watch tower, a place for your soldier stand and stand watch or for silly parots to sit on! Here's the front middle part, again those stones blocking the way! Figures and Accesories: We have a delightful number of a soldier, a sailor, and a scurvy pirate! A lovely parot! And a generous assortment of weapons! That concludes our review"
p5878
aS" Overall: It's a fantastic little set, and great for army and supplies and bricks gathering! I can't find any faults with this set, it's just the neatest little thing you've seen in a port *wub* Highly recomended *y* "

p5881

p5882
aS" A fine little set with 64 pieces and 3 figures for under $10  May have seemed a bit steep in 1991, but I wouldn't know, I'd passed into my dark ages already, so alas, I haven't a copy of this set"
p5883
aS' Looking at the parts list, I could build one out of my current inventory though'

p6263
aS' The only annoying bit about it is that the crystal-holding thing in front wobbles all over the place  The alien fits into it by way of impalement  It must hurt getting in and out'

p6265
aS' The rear "shell" of the fighter starts out around the alien containment chamber'
p6266
aS" It's a bit odd that the containment chamber has an alien sticker, because the instruction booklet lists it as holding crystals  The crystal canister is held back by a technic pin"
p6267
aS' This is, without a doubt, the ugliest color arrangment EVER  Warning: Mass stickers  :-X The cockpit fits into grooves in the "shell"  Then it clicks into place in a 1x1 brick with a horizontal clip'
p6268
aS' The wing "mechanism": The wing  For some reason, the body of the "mechanism" has a blue brick  *wacko* The wing and "mechanism" connect to prevent the fighter doing a nosedive while in tank mode'
p6269
aS' The wing "mechanism" completed: The underside: The body and wing connect by way of a miscolored red brick  I have no idea why it\'s red- black would bave been much, much better  Completed'
p6270
aS" Tank mode: All in all, this looks pretty neat  The wheel base is pretty short, but it's not bad  Transform! The set transforms neatly, if ungainly"
p6271
aS' Without "Anti-grav" support, it would fall forward on it\'s nose each time it transformed  Jet mode  It\'s all right, but it could be a bit better'
p6272
aS' The "shell" keeps slipping back forward to the "tank mode" because there\'s nothing to stop it sliding  Spare parts: Overall: I thought this set was great'
p6273
aS' It could do with some fixing, such as the mismatched colors, but it should be a definate buy for MM fans  Brickshelf Gallery (When available)'

Rp6302
aS' Thanks for that very good review, Mr  Mandalorian! *y* I think that this is a plain beautiful set, oh how I wish that TLC would?ve taken that direction from the beginning   '
p6303
aS" :'-) The design is much more practicable, with fewer non-system parts and technic beams with(!) studs     this makes everything much more easier to MOD and a lot more useful, at least IMO"
p6304
aS' *y* So it?s for sure not very hard to make the (wonderful enclosed) cockpit one brick higher, and even that little Alien Ship looks decent and nice   '
p6305
aS' X-O And the fighter looks sleek and elegant too, in both modes! That?s just very cool, compliments, TLC  Now all we need?re aliens with moving arms and here we go, Classic Space on forever! X-D'
p6306
aS' Thanks for a very thorough review  I might think about getting this  I really like the mini alien fighter, and the transformation idea is always a welcome one'
p6307
aS" Both modes look pretty good, despite the some of the odd coloured bricks (which I'd MOD out)  You know what it reminds me of? Some of the futuristic designs in the Gerry Anderson series "
p6308
aS" Wow  This is actually quite a neat set! It is definitively my favorite in the line after the big drilling unit! \\begin{geek} I'm not sure it would nose dive when transforming from tank mode"
p6309
aS" I guess it would pick up speed and transform quickly since it doesn't seem to have any downwards pointing thrusters  \\end{geek}"

p6449
aS" Plus, on top of all that, it's got a nice selection of parts, including some lovely new ones, and the inlaid box is interesting  Well worth getting, I think "

aS' Here is my review of the set 6265 Sabre Island! Overview: Sabre Island was release in 1990 an it contained 92 pieces and its retail price was $15 50'
p6675
aS' It comes with 3 Imperial Blue coats, and a nice outpost for them'
p6676
aS' The pictures + full review: Anyway, you can see here a picture of the box, the model shown on the box differs from the actual model slightly    '
p6677
aS'And the back of the box, which shows some nice alternative models from the pieces provided  A close up of two or three of the alternative models  And now for the minifigs'
p6678
aS' I prefer the Red coats over the Blue coats but these minifigs are nice, and for the number of pieces one gets a fair amount of them'
p6679
aS' The set itself makes a nice small outpost, it comes complete with a palm tree, a cannon (with ammo) on a turntable, a small tower a nice large Imperial flag and a little red row boat! Here is a shot from ground level showing the cannon and Blue coat (patrolling the out post!) The rowing boat was a nice touch, and it comes with a small flag too'
p6680
aS' "No Pirates will avoid the wrath of myself and my mighty Island!" The top of the tower is rather plain and simple which in some ways is good, as it keeps the whole set detailed yet not crowded, but I feel a little something should of been added to the top though'
p6681
aS' The back is lacking any type of walls, so one can play with the minifigs inside, yet their are also no stairs or any other ways for the Blue Coats to climb up their tower either! The rag tag pirates attack Sabre Island! But never fear, The Lord Of Pies is here! Me throwing a pie at Captain Ironhook from another angle'
p6682
aS' Overall I think this is a very good, if somewhat simple set, and makes a great cheap Imperial set! Comments, thoughts and Opinions are welcome! (And sorry about the darkness in some photos, I have not had time to take photographs when it is till light recently, for when I return home it is dark |-/ ) Edit: Fixed, Thank you!

aS' X-D Also at this service station is a propane tank refilling station  The milkman is our first propane customer  The interior has also had an addition and many upgrades'
p6816
aS" For instance, this building now has florescent lighting, a big frig in the back, and more shelf space  *y* Oh look! there's the officer purchasing a mountain dew"
p6817
aS" Now that there's more shelf space, we can sell more than just 1x1 round yellow bricks and levers"
p6818
aS' We now have available 1x1 round plates and 1x1 round cones available in multiple colors! :-D With this upgraded gas station, hopefully this town will bring in more business and customers into my small town'

aS" It looks very cozy!!! Amazing how you said you built it by the book, does that mean you didn't have the set but you used your own pieces to rebuild the thing? The flourescent lighting is genius! And the interior space looks just like what you'd see at those little shops"
p6822
aS' I really dig the moc ;-) it gives me good ideas and now I want a gas station of my own :-P And the history behind how it was "rebuilt" and how it will improve business etc is so cool *wub*'

aS'99, which, is pretty steep, but, you get quite a bit for your money  Front of the Box : Back of the Box : Back of the Box Closeup : Contents : It was a nice surprise to get numbered bags   '
p7001
aS" not had a large set with numbered bags for quite a while, at least in none of the sets I've bought recently! Didn't take a close up of the stickers, but I was quite disappointed that the curved pieces had stickers "

p7003

p7005

p7006
aS' These spears are just loosely placed into technic holed bricks'
p7007
aS' Quite easy to make em flick out but they can go anywhere! hehe Entrance : Holey Floor & Spears : These two parts are hinged and on an angle to each other and the gap makes for a handy bottomless pit, complete with pole for Indy to swing over with his whip'
p7008
aS' After that, you create the door and the ratchet mechanism to keep it raised  After that, you add the runners for the ball and the swinging knives trap'
p7009
aS' Swords Trap - Before : After : Finally, you build the statue that holds the efigy  Nice bit of construction here, especially the way that everything falls over once the efigy is removed'

p7013
aS" there's no room for a border around the sticker here! Beware!! After all that is done, you join all the pieces together and it makes more a really good playset"

aS"Tks so much Big Pete for thisd awsome review of yet another fantastic Indy sets !! Its clearly one of the best lines of all times with SW 8-? That idol is superb and I love all the details of that set: loads of cool defense mechanisms, sweet vegetation and yeay another black carrot torch :-P And those MFs are really nice !! I am so happy to see Lego go dark tan *wub* Now I clearly can't wait to enjoy building this set ;-) Fertility Idol On !! *yoda*"
p7137
aS' i just noticed another inconsistency between box art and the actual set   '
p7138
aS" on the box, the biplan has white wing supports (they're just plane windows without glass in them) and yet the set they are dark grey (or is it bley   "
p7139
aS' can never tell the difference without careful study)  Add to that     the outer of the engine at the front is white on the box and black in the set'
p7140
aS" We don't normally have this many inconsistencies do we ?"
p7141
aS" This set is so cool    and another must buy! :-$ I'm in trouble next year it seems  "
p7142
aS' The figs are great! *wub* I think the plane is only OK; perhaps they should have made that in a separate set as it needed to be a certain size to fit the figs, but that meant that the tail is way too short'
p7143
aS' Here is a picture of the actual plane so you can see what I mean  (Notice the pilot is fishing  '
p7144
aS' ;-) ) The temple is another story; I think Lego have done an incredible job with this, fitting in the key parts of this sequence without making an absurdly large model'
p7145
aS" Addtionally, there are many parts in this set that I haven't got so it shouldn't be too hard to justify  X-D Thanks for another great review"

p7149
aS' I think the plane looks better with those being white '
p7150
aS" Because of exams and other obligations, I haven't posted this sooner  Seeing that no-one else has reviewed this set, I thought I might as well do it myself"
p7151
aS' The set in its entire glory (minus the slammer, instructions and the (obviously) massive sticker sheet) The four cars included in this set; a muscle car, a sports car, a roadster and the police off-roader(!): Because the police obviously have no clue that an off-roader is useless for catching street-racers, no less a batmobile-ish sports car, it will always trail behind: But the police have a trick up their sleeve - the drawbridge: Gotcha! And the mechanism that makes it all tick: The motor is nothing more than a (slow) pull-back motor'
p7152
aS" Push down the bridge, the latch will hook on to the gear and keep it in place until the latch is released  And there's the new gas station"
p7153
aS" Staying within theme, this gas-station is, like the tanker in 8147, from the company Fuel 4 Speed: There's a notable presence of detail here, such as the soda-dispenser, water (coolant?) bottles and other accesories, two fuel pumps and bumper-level railings to prevent cars from crashing into them"
p7154
aS" There's no interior however"
p7155
aS' And as demonstrated here by a loyal Octan-employee and a pursuing officer, the gas station is built to minifig-scale: My impressions of this set: As a collector of tiny turbos, and yet to miss a set, I got this one regardless of what it included'
p7156
aS' The gas station is indeed very nice, and the minifig-scale accesories were unexpected'
p7157
aS' The lack of interior is no big issue, and the both the station and bridge can with ease be implemented into a mini-fig town'
p7158
aS' The bridge also solidly built, and includes the ramps in its design, so it can be lifted, with ramps attached, without breaking apart'
p7159
aS' The slammer included in the set is identical, apart from the white color, with those in 8147'
p7160
aS" The cars are also very nice, altough I am yet to get used to the yellow batmobile, as I've grown accustomed to calling it"
p7161
aS" I also love the off-roader's chunky tires, they make perfect wheels for the newer minifig-scale cars"
p7162
aS' I never consider price/parts ratio, and here it would, for me, be irrelevant, because it will never be demolished for parts'
p7163
aS" The play value is what I would consider pretty good, and while the bridge won't rise with a car on it, it's still strong enough to stay open with a car tipping over the edge  Hmm"
p7164
aS' Every nerve in my body is saying that this sets is worth roughly 8/10, so: Verdict: 8/10 Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 07:01 PM  Indexed'
p7165
aS"Looks like a nice set, I like the tiny turbos and have most of the older individual cars, but I am put off by the ever increasing price of the large sets with lots of extra parts that I'm not really interested in"

p7241
aS' And the rest of the tube connectors  Heres the farthest I got the little missle to go  Its fairly dissapointing  Good thing I didnt expect much from this portion of the set'
p7242

p7245
aS' In the instructions it says for the end of the elevator prong to be touching the tube connector where it is shown here, but mine has a 1x space inbetween  No matter  Heres the completed base'
p7246
aS' + My knee  Again  Onto the spaceship  The bulk of it is just technic supporting beams, with some large slope peices covering it all up  More on that later  The white coverup'
p7247
aS' The middle section lifts up to store the overly large jetpack  As you see, the storage containers take up most the bulk in the back, and you can see the jetpack on the ground'
p7248
aS' Aswell as the trigger hand hold thing that allows you to swoosh it  Look, in the back! Lego Greebles! Despite the large cockpit, it only holds one person, laying down'
p7249
aS' The wings are really the saving grace - double layered with a nice two toned effect'
p7250
aS' Kitty nudged me this picture so its abit blurry, my apologies :-| Extra peices and or peices I have no idea where the hell they go  :-P Overall, the set is quite fun I must admit'
p7251
aS' Full price, I probably would not go for it, But I got it for just under 70 dollars'
p7252
aS' For that price I can confidently say its quite worth it, many useful peices, nice figures (other than the aliens) and the tube things are quite fun to boot, even though I liked the life on mars system more, which I also have'
p7253
aS" None the less, its very fun to make them shoot around  Alright, so its not much of a command base either, and it looks abit bare  But it's still fun, even if you ignore the nerf section"
p7254
aS' Overall I give it a hardy 3 5 out of 5, the openness and epic fail of a missile launcher are hard to get by, but overall, its a dandy set :-D Merry Christmas *wub*'

p7405
aS' So here it is, the long expected ;-) review of the town plan: I bought it at the Legostore Riem Arcaden last Saturday  I paid 149,99 EUR for 1981 pieces  This set is separated in 4 parts'
p7406
aS' 1: the Service/Gasstation 2: the cars'
p7407
aS' the petrol pump and the fountain 3: the cinema 4: the town hall The Service Station has a lot of really nice details, like tools for the car repair, or the table with the cashpoint and the foodstation (there?s a croissant, a banana and a apple in this set)'
p7408
aS' One of my favourit parts is the trolley with some tools, you can see it at brickshelf'
p7409
aS' At the second part are only a few pieces and i needed not much time to built the 2 cars, the fountain and the petrol pump  There?s something at the truck i don?t understand '
p7410
aS' maybe i did something wrong   but   the truck has no backlights   *wacko* I like the petrol pump, that?s why i post a pic of it: The cinema is the highlight for me'
p7411
aS' It has also really nice details, like the popcorn table or the gumball or candy machine  The colours sheme is really nice, the front of the building with the big displays is a cool idea'
p7412
aS' Overall a really nice building  The town hall has also a really nice colour sheme, i love that dark green mixed with the white stairs  A lot of plants around and in the town hall'
p7413
aS' As you can see some figs who married there  Not more to say about this building  See the pics and enjoy it: Overall this set is a must have!! It was really fun to built it'
p7414
aS' This set reminds me of the Back to the Future movie with Michael J  Fox  The whole gallery is at Brickshelf, there you can find a few more pics  I hope you enjoyed this review  Regards Sandra'
p7415
aS' Great review Sandra, thanks for taking the time'
p7416
aS' I love the theatre and the town hall, and the married couple is just a cute little extra *wub* This looks fantastic not only for the model, but for parts as well!'
p7417
aS' Thank you for the great review Sandra *y*   I *wub* the detail that TLC added to this set  I would like to add that I think all the buildings look *sweet* '
p7418
aS' I really like how you compared the look to "Back to the Future"  When I saw the first pics, I thought the same thing  The look of the set is definitly the 1950\'s  I am :-( to see the price though'

aS" Wow, I'm surprised no one had done this already  First off, this is a truly lovely set that many people should own, even though it's SOLD OUT on the S@H :'-(   now lets start off with an overview"
p7620
aS" *Note*: I was missing a few of the pieces (the rabbit, the trike) when I toke the pics  The figs and a cat  The engine: I really love this thing  It's a beautiful 0-6-0 steam engine with a tender"
p7621
aS' This is probably the most detailed steam engine Lego has given us  I loved it so much, I made a non-holiday version for my town  The flat cars: I like these, but they seem a bit simple'
p7622
aS' Their cargo is good for Christmas or a birthday party  The passenger car: It resembles the green passenger car we got a while back, but I like the interior in this one a bit better'
p7623
aS" The caboose: a simple caboose like the one from 2001  the sad thing about it is thats there is no interior and it's hard to take the roof off"
p7624
aS' Overall: I like this set, but it is kind of hard to use during the non winter months  The price is kind of good, but with that price, it should have came with the motor'
p7625

aS' Okie guys and gals, here s time for some droid exploration with my review of set 7670  As a general statement I have to say its really a neat set that is not that expensive for what it holds'
p7711
aS' 1) Box art Like always I will start with pics of the box art  BTW, notice anything guys ? No bloody crappy DSS'
p7712
aS' Yes, finally a set without stickers and that feels great :-D 2) The Mfs Nothing really spectacular there  The only novelty lies within the inclusion of the new Commander (yellow torso) BD'
p7713
aS' Apart from that, there are 2 BDs and unfortunately yet another SBD (I like those but I have a huge amount of them, and I would rather had something different)'
p7714
aS' You have 3 short blasters and a couple of extra parts  3) The Spider Droid I think it?s a pretty cool little buggar  It?s a rather simple yet classic construction I think'
p7715
aS' It has sweet parts such as the BD body in dark bley  It really has a spider feel unlike the previous Ep3 one  4) The Hailfire Droid This baby represents the ?pi?ce de resistance? of this set'
p7716
aS' I truly love it !! Sure it?s a bit under scale but I don?t really mind that  Its conception is superb even if I totally dislike assembling those technic treads (especially 80 of those small things)'
p7717
aS' The ellipse of the treads is well balanced and that trans disc is a brilliant idea'
p7718
aS' The great thing is those new flick fire missiles: they don?t fall unlike the other ones and they do look good on this baby'
p7719
aS' Also you can put the wheels together and the missiles to gain some shelf space (easy storage ON :-D ) In conclusion those druids re really sweet and are perfect target practice for the upcoming RGS hehe !! I hope you enjoyed that review and do not hesitate to comment and ask pic requests if any ;-) *yoda*'

aS' The extras are OK: another great postal worker'
p7831
aS' You also have yet another red trolley with a package that is a bloody sticker yet again !! G TLC should have more printed parts !! That plane for me is a classic thing of beauty !! Really is consistent with the fantastic planes of the 80?s'

I was so tired though that i couldnt stay awake to buy them! im taking a flight again on Tuesday and i hope they are not out of stock!! thanks for a great review Yoda! a fine job as always! cant wait for your next one'

aS' Aww man, is TLC really getting too cheap for printed parts? Shame on you TLC!! Despite those stickers these are two really neat sets  Especially the airplane'

aS'Great Review *yoda* (I find myself saying that line alot :-D ) I love these two little sets *wub* TLC continues the Great City Line that started in 07 and continues into 08 Its also nice to have other sub lines besides Fire and police :-| :-P I hope there are many more Postal Sets, like a Post office!!That would be sweet!

aS"Thanks for the review! I was always going to get these two sets, so you haven't swayed me at all!! X-D I reckon Lego could enhance this sub-theme by releasing a post motorbike (with or without a sidecar) and post office"

aS' Obviouly the office would be the hub of all the activity, while the post bike would take care of the postal run'
p7875
aS' This would free up the van to take or recieve bulk mail or parcels to or from the airport  It could then also do the parcel deliveries around the city'

aS" I paid a tad more than the S@H price: I paid 15 for the plane and 8 for the van (sure its a tad more expensive but I didn't want to wait for TRU to get them) Freddie, on Jan 5 2008, 06:10 PM, said: Am I the first one to notice the new doors used in the back of the van"
p7879
aS" Not only is it using the popular new frame, but the old container doors have been redesigned to fit with the new frame as well  Pity they're not yellow, though"
p7880
aS' Great remark there, I guess I totally missed that one :-$ And I agree that yellow doors would have been better but those dark bley do not look that bad !! Mr Hobbles, on Jan 5 2008, 09:10 PM, said: Can you tell me though, the wheels on the van, are they rubber or plastic? They look a bit tacky'

Also a small town feel post office would be so cool: like a 20/30? set ;-) We can be sure of one thing though, this year's advent calendar will have a postamn and small post office ;-) Post On !! *yoda*"

Those posts sets will be mine, but I will wait to find them in my supermarket, even if I have to wait 2 or 3 months, I know that I will save some money, so I will buy more LEGO :-D There are simple designed sets, but we don't need more: two nice litle sets that are not oversized and too expensive"

p7935
aS' On a side note, did anyone notice the message on the back of both sets\' boxes, "designed for easy building and instant play"? It surprised me a little, since these sets seem no less complex than any other City set of late'

p7965
aS'95 it was hard to pass this one by as I was foraging for the new 2008 Star Wars sets at the local Target'
p7966
aS' Plus, I was itching to do another review since I had finally fully recovered from my marathon UCS Falcon review which took the better part a month to complete'
p7967
aS' The Box: The box is pretty standard Creator type box which shows off the three models (beach house, Caf? and ?towering? apartment building'
p7968
aS') The back of the box shows some of the features of the three models'
p7969
aS' Interesting features of the three models prominently displayed on the back include: - Food counter complete with coffee (espresso) maker and food warmer (with chicken leg!) - Home office complete with laptop (and the ubiquitous coffee cup'
p7970
aS') - Flip up roof granting access inside of beach house  Note the satellite TV dish and even rain gutters along the roofline! Opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals'
p7971
aS' We?re back to the reusable cereal box type tab system that we saw so often in 2007 sets  Note the parts inventory is on the side of the box as well  This is a nice feature'
p7972
aS' Once inside the box, we are greeted by eight sealed bags plus two yellow 16x2 plates and a green 32x16 baseplate  Thank goodness there is no DSS (dreaded sticker sheet) but alas there are no minifigs'
p7973
aS' In addition, there are the three manuals (one for each model) and they were stuffed into my box with the care of kid trying to put 10 gallons (or liters if you prefer) of candy in a 5 gallon bucket'
p7974
aS' But hey, we?re not collecting manuals here so who cares if the manuals are all bent and warped? The Manuals: The three manuals are 74, 72 and 48 pages in length'
p7975
aS' They are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings: - Piece call outs for each step - Parts inventory at the end of the primary model build - Page numbers Color separation in these manuals were fine for me'
p7976
aS' Plus, we get the usual verbose LEGO instructions on not dumping all your pieces outside in the grass and not to dump all your pieces into a single pile'
p7977
aS' Thanks for the tip, TLG! Parts list The Pieces: Pretty standard stuff here and as I mentioned, lots of 1x1 plates and tiles (at least 100'
p7978
aS') However, we do get quite a few windows and a couple of doors  A majority of the color is black and yellow  I did see a few pieces that I was not familiar with so I?m going to show them below'
p7979
aS' Keep in mind I?m not a parts jockey so bear with me if I think a part is brand new for 2008 and it was actually released with the classic space line'
p7980
aS' 2x2 Window (fixed) and 4x3 window that opens: The follow photo shows the window glass (same as in Corner Caf?), door glass and new black parts  Turns out these black parts are used as wheels'
p7981
aS' I showed the window glass because it still contains the molding circle just like they did before  It is hard to see from the photo, but it is there'
p7982
aS' The door glass I think might be new: I don?t recall seeing these 2x2 round plates with clips before and I thought I would show the mail only because it is printed and not a sticker: I know these are common, but didn?t they have four studs on top? These only have two: How about this sloped 4x3 window that opens: Overall a nice assortment of parts with nothing juniorized'
p7983
aS' The Build: The build was fun and was fairly straightforward  Once you figure out which of the three models to build, it goes pretty quick'
p7984
aS' Here are a few shots: See how the inside is made: Look at the detail with the flowers and even the outside water faucet! Outdoor seating area: Upstairs being built: Upstairs with opening roof (notice the satellite TV dish): Check out the patio on the upstairs complete with outdoor light and rain gutters! Here?s my favorite, the BBQ grill'
p7985
aS' At least we know where those new parts go: Finally, check out the tree  No juniorization here! Here is what is left over: So far, I have only built the primary model'
p7986
aS' The others look interesting, especially the caf?  The Design: The design was well done  Very rich in detail  I love how there are no juniorized parts'
p7987
aS' The house is accessible by taking off the top floor (like Caf? Corner and Market Street)  There is an internal staircase as well'
p7988
aS' There is no interior to speak of in the beach house, but there is in the other two models  The only real negative is that it is kind of small when you get it done'
p7989
aS' It would be nice if it was about 50% bigger'
p7990
aS' Here are a few views of the beach house with a few minifigs thrown in: Check out the close-up of the caf? which I think looks great: Also, here is a photo of the interior of the apartment building where you can see the office and computer: Overall Thoughts: It is a really nice set'
p7991
aS' A tad on the small side but it has some great detail and lots of features  Quick enough to build all three models and would fit real nice into an existing town plan'
p7992
aS' Is minifig scale, but does not come with any  Lots of window parts and black slopes  Is a nice diversion from the onslaught of Clone Wars ships that we can?t remember seeing from the movies'
p7993
aS' Final Rating: 84% Build 9/10 (Pretty quick and fun ) Functionality 9/10 (It is a Creator set so you have multiple varied builds  Diverse enough to keep the kids entertained'
p7994
aS') Design 10/10 (Excellent and well thought out  Outstanding detail for such a small model ) Parts 6/10 (Fair, nothing earth-shattering but lots of slopes and windows'
p7995
aS') Price 8/10 (Price ratio is good but you get a lot of little parts  Would be better with minifigs ) Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 06:38 PM  Indexed'

p8123
aS" Thanks for the review Dunamis, this is a great little set! I'm also very impressed with Takuto20's mods  I've been trying a few of my own"
p8124
aS' I liked the tower block design, but a lot of stuff needed fixing  Firstly I added a 4th wall, and made it so the storeys could be lifted off like in the other models'
p8125
aS" I also added flowers on the windowsills and doorways out on to the balconies  Still to be added is an extra door for the top floor which I'm going to get from the new doors and windows pack"
p8126
aS' I added a chimney that goes all the way up the back of the house, and has a fireplace on every level  Each floor is fully furnished with a fireplace, wash basin and bed on the upper levels      '
p8127

p8130
aS' 1  BEFORE BUYING Even if I am City fan, those new sized planes are really not mine cup of tea, my love to Lego is firmly frozen somewhere between years 1980-1995'
p8131
aS' Main reason to buy was, that I wanted to write a review at Czech Afol web Kostky org  I bought it three days ago via web advertising, price was +- 35 USD  2'
p8132
aS' AFTER OPENING THE BOX As presumed, some very big parts and three bags, and as an additional bonus lot of Danish air free of charge'
p8133
aS' First sight told me, that this will be really short and easy building   3  IMPRESSIONS DURING BUILDING    and it was really true  30 minutes of lazy building  Bag 1 - plane'
p8134
aS' Bag 2 - plane gondols with supports  Bag 3 - wings and propellers'
p8135
aS' When I saw the way, how is this plane made, I was strongly thinking to play Money for Nothing from Dire Straits as a music accordant with whole set  4'
p8136
aS' IMPRESSIONS AFTER BUILDING - LOOKOUT Juniorized creeps  This is my first plane in this scale and for 99% the last one'
p8137
aS' Lack of details, lot of ugly big parts, from whole set you can see the main development target - to keep RRP at some certain low level'
p8138
aS' Inner space of airplane absolutely undone, no details, no luggage, no computers, nothing at all!! Just a lot, lot of air! The very only details in whole plane are the stickered pilots desk and some kind of seat constuction'
p8139
aS' 5'
p8140
aS' IMPRESSIONS AFTER BUILDING - PLAYABILITY But, what is playability at this set? Hydroplane, which cannot float (as seen on enclosed photos) ? If TLC will make some new kind of big parts used for gondolas, to make the plane floating, they will for sure make no other damage'
p8141
aS' Juniorization couldn?t be higher  You even cannot drive across the carpet with the plane  So, how to play? Open the doors, open the cabin part, and turn with propellers? Weak, Weak, Weak! 6'
p8142
aS' RESUMED IMPRESSIONS Sadly I must say, that at limited release sets TLC? boat seems to sailing to the worst part of the coast'
p8143
aS' After quite good 7344, perfect 7899 and 7900, strange, but acceptable 7998, juniorization came back with 7906, followed with this ugly Playmobilized 7732  7'
p8144
aS' FINAL WORD In fact, even 15 USD seems to be too much for this kind of set  35 USD, expected RRP in our country, is really overpriced to hell  Neither set, nor minifig is not interesting'
p8145
aS' TLC maybe knows about juniorization as well, as nowhere on the box the number of pieces isn?t written'
p8146
aS' If you my AFOL friends want to spent your bucks, better give half of the price to African orphans'

aS'Hello and welcome to another Redman set review! Well, actually, the first Redman set review! I\'m your host, Redman, and today I adorn my medieval outfit to tell you about the Impulse set simply titled "The Knight"'
p8251
aS' This is a great set, with 14 pieces, 2 of which are spare, and a minifig with 2 weapons, 2 helmets, and some shiny armour'
p8252
aS' All this is packaged in a tiny box, just short of 10 cm? (or 3? inches?), with a neat little instruction manual that folds up to the size of the weapons rack included in the set'
p8253
aS' As you can see, this set only costs a measly 7 NZD  (Disclaimer: Redman not included ) Here we see the box, clearly showing what the box holds'
p8254
aS' On the top we see a 1:1 scale picture of a minifig, for those new to Lego, or who have forgotten how big a minifig is I guess'
p8255
aS' :-/ X-D The instruction manual, showing the nice and easy built, with me for size comparison  :-D (*Sorry about the dark image, I had to lean over the light to get a birds eye pic'
p8256
aS' ;-)*) Here we see the 2 different soldiers you can make with the set; a knight, and a guard or standard troop or soldier or whatever you want to call him  '
p8257
aS" (Note, each set comes with only 1 minifigure, and additional accessories ) Of course you know I'm in the picture just for the sake of it, I'm not really one of the soldiers"
p8258
aS' X-D The neat little weapons rack, or rather equipment rack, as it holds not only a weapon but a shield (except the ovoid ones), helmet, and armour'
p8259
aS" Nice and easy storage, so your equipment won't get dirty lying around on the ground"
p8260
aS" :-D One of the spare parts is another of those robot hands, so you can stick that in place of the shield and allow the rack to hold 2 weapons  Just thought you'd like to know that"
p8261
aS' :-$ And here we see the nifty little structure of the thing'
p8262
aS" It can even support a whole minifig! Note the grey stud on the bottom bar is a spare part, I just find it better used there to hold the armour  :-) Huh? I don't remember this picture  "
p8263
aS" 8-| It appears I drifted off, and these guys don't look too happy I overtook their weapons equipment rack  :-$ I should go  "
p8264
aS' X-D So, in conclusion this is a great set for army building, at a reasonable price, with nice equipment, and it can be picked up as a little extra with your normal shopping'
p8265
aS" X-D That's all for today folks! *sweet* [/Redman] So, what do you think? Should I continue with these Redman Reviews ? (:-P), or just stop now? X-D Comments and criticism welcome! :-$ ~Peace"

aS' Well today i finally got my hands on set 7038, now since the moment i first saw pics of this set i knew it was for me  So lets start with the new troll helmet and torso, these are both great'
p8320
aS" This troll really stands out as a leader when next to the usual trolls in the dwarf mining set: Ok so here's a few shots of the front of the set: Now one thing i really like about this set is the way that lego have placed the back wheels higher than the front"
p8321
aS' This allows the set to really appear to being pulled: Here we have a shot at the missiles on the wagon, these are better than some around i have to say'
p8322
aS" If you look just behind the bottom missile you will see a simple firing device, simply push it down and then let it go to see those missiles fire: The troll flag is moved behind the missiles for firing: One thing that does bother me about this set is the lack of anything on the rear, ok it's easy to fix with a little moc'ing so it's not the end of the world but i would of liked something placed there: Now lets move on to the Crownie's wagon, this is simple yet good for holding weapons: As for the Crown knights themselves, well there the ones from the impulse sets which is great IMO: Here's a few quick shots of the 2 larger trolls we have so far, i prefer the sand green one"
p8323
aS" What about you? Well that's the end for now, requests for pics and comments are welcome"

aS" Overall i rate this set as a must for anyone who's a fantasy castle fan, i know i'll be getting more of this set     "

aS' Lego City Truck & Forklift Set # 7733 Pieces: 343 Price: $24'
p8445
aS"99 (USD) Store of Purchase: Toys R'Us Release Date: January 2008 After discussion of the mysterious yellow cargo contained in this new City transport set and a visit to my local TRU, I purchased this set"
p8446
aS' I was immediately pleased with the price/piece which I think is pretty reasonable (343 pieces for $25)'
p8447
aS' Starting with the box, great City artwork boasting "Special Edition": Tha backside of the box (no alternate models comes as no surprise): The dreaded decals (I was looking for the skull and bones for radioactive, but no such luck): My favorite part of the set, a very clever forklift: Side view: And the backside: What I like about the forklift is the bars across the top giving the vehicle a "real-life" design'
p8448
aS" The double wheels in the front with two pieces that can hold the wheels also adds to a clever design: I like the figs (although not much new - perhaps I'll make the driver into a werewolf later): The set includes three cargo pallets, the first some sort of fuel with gauge: The 2nd, two Indy containers, and a square 2x4 brick (I have not put the decals on yet): And the mysterious yellow cargo"
p8449
aS' Your guess is as good as mine :-$   On to the truck, the front section: The front grill: Another angle: The back: I like the opening mechanism that is very simple, but works well'
p8450
aS' Also is the large plate tile piece inside'
p8451
aS' I like this because the entire interior has no studs: And the trailer section of the truck: Orange and yellow tail lights: And the rear trailer open: The complete set: Summary: This is a neat set that reminds me a bit of classic Lego City (but larger)'
p8452
aS' It is very playable and has a lot of accessories adding to the value  The build was very simple, and enjoyable (took me about an hour)'
p8453
aS' It is a great addition to a number of City sets including the Cargo Ship, Container Stacker, the World City Cargo Train, and the new Cargo Plane'
p8454
aS" As I mentioned previously, I have not yet put on the decals that I'm sure will really add to the overall look of the set  The forklift is awesome and I like the cargo containers"
p8455
aS' The truck could have benefited from a few additional details (chrome smokers, and an undercarriage box that really opens)  Considering everything, I would buy this set again'
p8456
aS' Hope you enjoy and perhaps this mysterious cargo will make its way into a Brickster Mystery  *y*'

aS' 5150 Lego, on Jan 20 2008, 11:50 AM, said: Great review! My only grip with this set is you can only fit one pallet in the truck'
p8555
aS' It should have been the same size as the trailer so you can at least fit 2 pallets  Seems like alotof wasted space'
p8556
aS" If i'm going to transport cargo, i want to use the maximum amount of space aviable!! X-D That's a fair gripe  Someone else mentioned it above as well  I thought the same thing when I went to load it "
p8557
aS"I got this set last week and just to add a few of my own points CONS: - The forklift spring feels a bit flimsy - I don't know how long it will last or how much stress it would take - and the end coil isn't really heavily secured to the lift mechanism"
p8558
aS" Time will tell on that one  - 30 stickers! It's the Exo-Force of City sets! The truck set does look less plain with them on though"
p8559
aS" I would reccomend lining them up with the green brick in the second container rather than applying the first lot without a guide or they may end up uneven - It's very hard to put the minifig in the forklift without dismantling (or breaking open) the set slightly - The cargo box attached to the main cabin of the truck doesn't hold very strongly - Minifigs are dull - that dark blue torso with pattern is way overused - green stickers are a different green to the bricks themselves PROS: - lots of nice pieces including the large white panels and cargo pieces, and i like the green/ white colour scheme - the cargo doors open well and the hingeing mechanism doesn't stand out to the detriment of the rest of the set (as some people have complained about the mail airplane) - studless floor in cargo containers makes it easy to move pallets in and out - fits in better than the Heavy Hauler to a minifig sized city - new 1x1x4 slope! (at least I hadn't seen it before) OVERALL - nice set with some good pictures, although a bit flimsy, and way too many stickers - the same issues I have with the Cargo Plane as well (although that had more colour issues)"
p8560
aS'hey, thanks for the review The Brickster! i was just wondering if you could possibly upload a picture of the instructions for the forklift, and, if possible, tell me the piece # of the 1x4 slope bricks (to bricklink them)'

p8566
aS' Greetings, and welcome to another Redman Review! I\'m your host, Redman, and today I adorn my medieval outfit to tell you about the Impulse set simply titled "The Knight"'
p8567
aS' No wait, that\'s the old script  X-D I mean, "The Good Wizard"'
p8568
aS" *sweet* The other Castle Impulse set (the first being 'The Knight'), this is a wonderful, and in my case unexpected addition to the Castle line! I did not expect to get a nice good wizard, but rather another plain white skellie for the Impulse, and was pleasantly surprised when I saw the first picture of this set"
p8569
aS" The Impulse sets give you pieces you wouldn't expect to see in such small sets, for example, The Knight came with the armour, and this comes with an owl, a gem, and a crystal ball piece"
p8570
aS" It comes with 11 pieces, including the wand, owl, and gem, and no spares, which doesn't really matter as it doesn't need any"
p8571
aS' The box sports the set number, age range (which I blissfully ignore X-D), awesome Castle logo, and the assembled set, with the usual 1:1 scale picture of a minifig'
p8572
aS" The back of the box shows pictures of the boxed Skeleton Tower and King's Castle Siege sets  Note the price is in New Zealand dollars, and is really the same prica as any other Impulse set"
p8573
aS' Next are the instructions, which are separated into 3 parts, 1 for the minifigure, 1 for the table, and one for the bird stand'
p8574
aS' Very simple, also worth mentioning is the parts numbers are next to their respective parts, for replacement parts etc'
p8575
aS" On the back we see (on the top half) pictures of Skeleton Prison Carriage, Skeleton Tower, and King's Castle Siege, this time not of the boxed sets, but the sets themselves"
p8576
aS" On the lower half we have 8 pictures, each of the different Impulse sets  The Wizard's torso is plain sand blue, with no patterns or anything, but it doesn't really matter is his beard's in the way"
p8577
aS" ;-) The head is that same old 'white fade to grey beard' head, but the white beard covers up most of the grey  My favourite part is the pants, I love that we're getting printed belts and legs again"
p8578
aS" His belt has 4 gold crosses (as seen in, if you look closely, the new Crownie's torso and the Crownie archer's torso) and a belt buckle, and the legs have a bottle, a coin, and a small bag"
p8579
aS' Nice little wizard-ey items'
p8580
aS' The, er, items, no, accessories, no, models? The stuff in the set include a little stand for the owl, and a table utilising the new 4x4 round piece in light bley, with the crystal ball in the middle, encasing the yellow gem held on by a 2x2 circle piece in blue'
p8581
aS" Why blue, I'm not sure  Maybe it's because the crystal is yellow, and the Crownie's colours are blue and gold, so the blue piece with the yellow crystal symbolise the Crownie's colours"
p8582
aS' Or maybe TLC just felt the need to include an odd colour'
p8583
aS" :-P In conclusion, this is a wonderful set, with some neat accessories, and it doesn't really need to be bought in the masses, after all, you needs an army of owls and wizards? :-| :-P So it works fine as a single set, and adds a more fantasy feel to your Crownie army"
p8584
aS" That's all for today folks! *sweet* [/Redman] Thanks for reading another of my Redman interviews, any suggestions on how to/what to do to improve it is greatly appreciated, as are all comments and criticisms (except those blatant thoughtless criticisms that don't help at all :-P)! ~Peace Edited by KimT, 10 August 2008 - 01:31 PM"

p8615
aS' The only thing that could have been better in my opinion is the wand, I always liked this one: I miss those wands! They could\'ve used it, but I think the wood wand kindda adds "realis" to the set, and since many fans don\'t like their castle theme to be too fantasized, I guess Lego decided to use a mold that was still being used for various sets'
p8616
aS" When I get this set I'm going to put it on the Tower in the King's castle, you know, the one that is right above the throne room? ;-) That'll be a great spot, and then I'll finally have all the necessary characters, the King in his throne, the knights on the walls, the wizard on his tower top, and the Princess in her tower room that floats in mid air and is connected to the throne room by a 2-stud wide bridge! :-D I love the King;s castle siege set *wub*"

aS" :-P He's fixed it now  ;-) ~Peace"
p8704
aS" Well, since no-one seems to have done one for this set, here we go     Here's the complete set in all its glory"
p8705
aS' Yes, I really like it, but then, Tabletown has the capacity to support it and my green Army have their eyes on it as a potential military transport as well'
p8706
aS" :-) I'll start out with the little airport ground car thingy - very neat and functional, here are views front and back: Next up, the steps which allow the plane crew to embark and disembark: And to round off this little trio, the cargo loading platform, here in its lowered position"
p8707
aS' Note the prong thingy sticking out from the rear: And here raised'
p8708
aS" The prong thingy is now hinged up to support the back of the platform and keep it level: Here's a slightly different angle so you can see the pieces under there: The all-important cargo itself! Hmmm "
p8709
aS" not much for a plane this size    The cargo pallet slots neatly onto the loading platform: Here's the complete set of ground equipment - all attached: And so onto the plane itself"
p8710
aS' Note that unlike the other large planes, the main wing sits at the TOP of the row of bricks making up the side of the fuselage: I took it apart a little so you can see the internal construction of the fuselage'
p8711
aS' Note that the cargo area is really small, right at the back'
p8712
aS' What else is this thing carrying? Illegal immigrants? :-) A picture of the rear of the fuselage, just because I like the sticker: Front landing gear  WAY better than on the other large planes'
p8713
aS" I don't know if this is a new piece or what but I've had no problems with it at all, and my kids have been playing with it as well: The rather sexy rear undercarriage - this area reminds me of one of those giant Russian transport planes - wicked: Those angled grey slopes atop each side of the rear undercarriage annoy the heck out of me as they KEEP COMING OFF whenever I pick the plane up"
p8714
aS' I think a 1x4 plate on top to bind them together might solve that  A slightly blurry view (sorry) from underneath  The gear LOOKS like it might be capable of retracting internally, but alas, no'
p8715
aS" This is a shame as there's certainly enough room in there and it's a wasted opportunity IMO  Might have to modify that  "
p8716
aS' A view of one of the four engines, I personally think they look too small and should have something under the wing as well to make them rounder: Cockpit: Crew door, open'
p8717
aS' I LOVE the smooth action of these doors and the way they seal flush against the fuselage when closed: Cargo door, open: Crew door with docked ladder: Cargo door with docked loading platform: Cargo slots inside and locks into place the same way it sits on the loader, neat: The minifigs, sorry this one is a bit blurry: And that concludes this week\'s "Show and Tell"'

p8753
aS" *sweet* It's built very oddly  *wacko*"
p8754
aS' Thank you very much for a good and informative review, Doc Sinister  *y* This looks like the best of the BigPlanes to me, very nice and smoother than the rest'
p8755
aS" :'-) Although, like you?ve said, what the heck?re they transporting, diamonds and pearls? So much wasted space     And the landing gear should really fold in  *n*"
p8756
aS' I loved the pics in the catalogues but was a bit disappointed by the build and end result'
p8757
aS" My own thoughts: CONs: - as noted, the cargo space is really small considering the size of the plane, although I can see this is restricted due to playability - without the barrier in the middle, the cargo would slide all over the place while the plane was being swooshed - the cargo 'lift' (I'm not sure how else to describe it) is very weak and snaps off, although it is a clever design I think it's badly implemented - there is nothing to hold the cargo pallet to the cargo lift truck so it tends to slide off all over the place as soon as the truck moves - colour issues - I had at least 3 shades of green with the larger plane pieces and noticeable variances even with identical cargo hatch pieces"
p8758
aS' At least one of them also came quite scratched, which was a little disappointing - At $79'
p8759
aS"95 AUD it's $10 more than the Passenger Plane was with less pieces and figs, and no printed pieces whatsoever! more $ for less, methinks"
p8760
aS' PROs: - Lots of nice cargo crate pieces and even the stickers for these are pretty good'
p8761
aS" - landing gear piece adjusts very well to height differentials so the plane doesn't lose its gear as often as the earlier passenger planes - the hinging mechanism works very well to open the cargo holds - opens very smoothly and is not noticeable - I'd definitely like to see more of this technique - the little vehicles work well chained together and are all good small designs OVERALL: - I really like the large planes since 06 but I don't think they've still quite hit the nail on the head"
p8762
aS' Whereas the earlier planes were a little flimsy, this one is sturdier but has its own issues'
p8763
aS' The look of the Cargo Plane is nice, and the new landing piece and cargo hatch pieces are really great, but some design weaknesses and colour issues detract from the overall product'
p8764
aS" It's a shame as with a bit of tweaking this could have been a must-have set "
p8765
aS"Wow, that's a great review of a great set Dr S! *y* As you yourself have already noted, this has the potential to be a fantastic military MOC! With a bit of modification you can get the engines to be rounder, or perhaps do away with them completely and replace them with jet engines"
p8766
aS" *sweet* Though I can't think of a system to retract the undercarriage at the top of my head it seems like there's indeeed more than enough potential to do so"
p8767
aS" It reminds me rather of an Ilyushin Il-76, one of my favourite cargo planes  :'-)"

There was a production slip up as instead of Indy\'s head I get Anakin\'s! :-| |-/ I open the box up and there staring me in the face is his ugly face!! TLC is defiantly doing to here a gnarly complaint from me!! >:-( Ok now here we have the " real" Indy fig that is supposed to come with the set :-D I just noticed that his fedora hat goes down in the back! Bonus Picture Time, Here is a jacketless Indy with his sleeve torn off, like he looks in the Temple of doom *sweet* The next figure up is our lovely Marion *wub* *wub* *wub* Plus her head is reversible with a scared face X-D Love the new hairpiece in black!! Finally we have our undead skellie with second style head and poseable arms *The Well Of Souls The set itself is a nice model and playset! The Anubis statues are very cool and I love all the hieroglyphs on the walls 8-? Here is the SW link with Artoo and 3P0 X-D The Ark in its resting place The Ark removed, its very cool indeed, but TLC should have made the whole thing in chrome gold |-/ not metallic gold with brown and yellow!! The closeup of the Anubis statue, Yes the Eye is a sticker but at leasts a gold color! *Playability First off you can pull the pin on the Anubis statues which send them falling and taking out the walls'
p8830
aS' Behind the wall a skellie swings out! There is a lever in the back of the model where you push down and the snakes shower down upon the figs hehe With the snakes all around, Marion is both modeling with the new carrot torch and fending off viscous cobras :-D In the meantime Indy uses his whip to scale the wall and avoid all the snakes which he is afriad of'

p8832
aS' :-P The whip is bendable but it will always snap back into a coil, its some type of bendy hard plastic *Scoring Figs- 9/10 Model- 8/10 Playability- 8'

aS' Plus Indy, Marion and a skellie, great selection of figs but Sallah would have been better since he actually removes the ark with Indy However I am still wondering the point of the Anubis statues, this set does seem pretty silly :-P P'

p8920
aS'  here are the parts anyway    Here is the instruction of the first model, the Cargo Chopper  I love Creator sets for the different models, they always excite me'
p8921
aS' Just ignore me finishing off my nemesis in the background'
p8922
aS' Something very interesting that I liked in the instructions was this step where you must add those three 2x2 yellow rounded pieces under the chopper'
p8923
aS' This is for support while you build, which is handy, and later you take it off: And even later use it as the cargo'
p8924
aS' I found that to be rather innovative and clever, as well as - Hey! What are you hitting me for? Both instruction booklets have the same back: Now heres the Chopper itself'
p8925
aS" I love the design of it, it isn't quite minifig scale but its great all the same  This is my first non-Xpod or House creator set, and it sure is fun  Here me and iamded go for a dizzy ride"
p8926
aS" I love the nose of the copter, and the landing gear is fantastic  A shot from the other side  Oh dear, it seems we've been a bit sick from that ride, and were vomiting transgreen 1x1s"
p8927
aS' The cargo itself is nicely made, though I forgot to put on two tiles here :-$ '
p8928
aS' It fits in real well with the chopper to, and the line is great for giving iamded the wedgie he deserves: This is my first power function set, so I was pretty excited'
p8929
aS' The motor is intergrated really well into this set, and is activated by pushing that little 3x2 plate with the 1x1 slopes on it forward, until it hits the motor button, that orange knob'
p8930
aS" Another point of interest is the use of bley barrels on each side  I like this as I don't have those pieces in that colour  A shot of the motor"
p8931
aS' Its really simple, all you do is pull the hook out to any length that allows, then press the orange button and it will wind it back up'
p8932
aS' This makes the Chopper pull the cargo up into its bay, and iamded pull me here reluctantly to a whacking: A top view, is that MY head? A view of the chopper without the cargo in it'
p8933
aS" I love the lowered cockpit: The leftover pieces from building: (NOTE: iamded's head does not count as set piece) And a final shot of the set with me and iamded  Oh, it appear we're dead, oh dear  "
p8934
aS' Hope you enjoyed this review, soon I will post the two alternate models  I loved this chopper, its great to play with and has nice construction  It also has some handy pieces too'
p8935
aS' The motor function sounds like a gimmick but is well intergrated into this model'

aS"Thanks everyone, heres part 2: The second instruction booklet includes instructions for both alternate models, which is good, I hate having too many manuals: Here she is, the plane: Its very nice and well proportioned, but where did iamded get that laser? Overview, the landing gear is very sturdy and nice, and the wings are surprisingly good: Top view, iamded's head fell into the propellers, I was trying to save him, honest! A view of how the motor on this one works, by pushing the orange button you can make the prop spin"
p8973
aS' It is well integrated like the chopper, though the prop only spins for about 2 1/2 seconds  Still, its a nice feature: The tail is also well made, simple, but lovable'
p8974
aS' Oh, and check out that tank! The prop spinning, Agh! Is that MY hand? Final view, there seems to be some sort of explosion here 8-| Well I think I got iamded more than me atleast'
p8975
aS' The second model is also great, though not as good as the chopper  The lack of space to fit something into the cockpit brings it down a bit, but it is a very nice model overall'
p8976
aS' I recommend it, though unlike the chopper it will be hard to mod into minifig scale  So far so good with 4995, here are the leftover pieces from the model: Enjoy! Batbrick Away! >:-)'

aS' Thanks guys, heres the final part: The Instructions for the boat begin on page 46: The overall set, its actually much nicer than I thought it would be, the pictures on the box make it look ugly'
p8997
aS' Top view, Tommy Guns do not actually come with set ;-) Side view, the designers have done an excellent job with the hull, considering the lack of many slopes pieces'
p8998
aS' You can see it is pretty much minifig scale too: Here you can see that by pushing in the red technic axle, the "anchor" on the front will be hauled back into the boat: Back view, these outboard motors are pretty cool, though I wish they could go own into the water more: Overall, though the weakest model, its still a lot of fun, and has a clever way around the lack of a shapely hull'
p8999
aS' I was impressed with it after the building it, it even has two rounded SNOTTy bottom pieces on the nose of the boat to give the impression it is speeding through the water with the front lifting up'
p9000
aS' Lots of leftover pieces for this one: The pieces: Sorry about the poor photograph there, it was getting late :-$ Overall the Cargo Chopper is another great set in the fantastic Creator line'
p9001
aS" Loads of fun, great play, and some clever designs, it challenges you to make your own things, and even includes some nifty pieces (bley barrels! *wub* ) I won't give it a rating, but I'll just say I certainly recommend it to fans of the theme and Lego fans in general"

aS" 6258 Smuggler's Shanty Overview Smuggler's Shanty was released in 1992, it consisted of 69 pieces, 3 minifigs (two pirates, one Imperial) and it cost $9 25 (USD)"
p9027
aS' The set itself is a small but rather sturdy den for the pirates! Review: The minifigs consist of two pirates and one Imperial'
p9028
aS' The minifigs are not all that rare, which is disappointing, I would of liked a rarer fig! But still it is a good cheap source of pirate and Imperial figures'
p9029
aS" Here is an overall shot of the set, which includes the three figs, the shanty which is made using palm leaves pieces, and a nice grey shark nibbling at the soldier's oar"
p9030
aS' A close up of the soldier rowing hard in his boat'
p9031
aS' I would have preferred to have a normal soldier with shako hat, as I have more officers than normal soldiers now!: And a close up snap of the main structure'
p9032
aS' Note the wine glass, which was a nice touch! Funnily enough, only 4 pieces of treasure were included in this set, compared to the usual 8 gold coins in other sets'
p9033
aS' A view from the back, which also gives a good view of the pieces used to construct the shanty mainly simple black 1 by 1 bricks: The Shanty looks good from most angles but their are a few where the roof construction looks rather odd, but that is just a minor nitpick! Yet another view from the front,, this time at a slightly different angle'
p9034
aS' The yellow base plate looks rather nice too, I prefer it over the tan pieces we trend to get nowadays: "Attack!!" The Stupid drunk pirate in the background does not even notice! Overall I think this is a rather good set, despite some shortcomings, such as the lack of treasure and odd roof from some angles'
p9035
aS' The shark, Imperial soldier and useful parts make up for it, and of course the price is cheap on most auction sites, I got mine for a mere ?5 ($10), with the cheapest price on Bricklink being $8'
p9036
aS' Rate the set then leave your comments, thoughts and opinions!!!'

aS" First I'll comment on the review and at a later date I'll comment on the set"

p9039
aS' Very nice review, Lord of Pies! Thanks for taking the time to put this together, and especially for all the detailed pics  *y* I very much regret that my dark ages occured when they did'
p9040
aS' Basically, I missed out on all the cheap and easy troop building sets, and this one is certainly no exception'

p9043
aS' Great little set! I bought this set only a few years ago MISB and I am still very happy about it'
p9044
aS' The hut is simple but very effective as a castaway building on some deserted island, the palmleaves are a good addition to any Lego collection'
p9045
aS' This set had a nice amount of weapons, two for each pirate and two of those weapons are flintlock muskets as opposed to just pistols'
p9046

p9120
aS' Well since this topic has resurfaced, I would add my 2 cents about my appreciation of this set'
p9121
aS' It was the first and (unfortunately) the largest Pirate set I owned as a kid, but I played the wazoo out of it'
p9122
aS' Some of the minifigs have lost almost all their face printing after so many play sessions! Theres just something about the hut that appealed to me more than the cheesy skull-face islands we keep getting'
p9123

p9126
aS' So, here we go: Tub comparison with a minfig (thanks Brainbox): The lighting changes a bit throughout the photographs, as it was going dark outside, so I only really had my desk light, and I kept getting in the way'
p9127
aS" 4837 Mini Trains Now the box I really like  It's no different to those of last year's sets, but the colour here is simply fantastic, and really seems appropriate for the theme"
p9128
aS' So this is what you get inside  All the pieces are still inside the bag, the optical illusion was accidental :-D '
p9129
aS' No pieces of particular outstanding interest, but the dark green cheese slopes are rather nice  Look out for those later'
p9130
aS" 1 2 3 This is the main model, and uses all the pieces in the set (bar these two, which according to the inventory are spares, but as with all my other Creator sets, I'm cheating and leaving them in)"
p9131
aS" This is far and away the best model of the three, and evokes the iconic version of a steam train  The green looks superb, but I'm not sure whether that's due to the model itself or the actual colour"
p9132
aS" Moving on, we get to the second model: 1 Leftovers (yes, I admit, I was using a piece of paper) This isn't actually a bad model  I don't think it's quite as nice as the previous one, but it's not bad"
p9133
aS" It's different from the first model as well, which is good  Too muich of the same can be a bad thing  Finally, we come to the third model: Leftovers Now    I'll be honest"
p9134
aS" I don't really know what this is  It's not that good a model compared to the other two  That's all I can say, really  And of course, all the pieces fit into the tub"
p9135
aS' Overall: I have to say, I do like this set, despite the weak third model'
p9136
aS' The strength of the primary and secondary models make up for any weaknesses in the third, and I can imagine the pieces being fully usuable in building other trains'
p9137
aS" While the basic idea of these tubs isn't quite as good as the X-Pods with regards portability and general 'niceness' they aren't bad  And for a fairly cheap price (?3-4) as well"
p9138
aS" 4838 Mini Vehicles This is one of those set boxes that you see because of the ridiculously loud colours  Sound marketing scheme if you ask me  I've managed it again  There are pieces outside the bag"
p9139
aS' Or are there? Now these I like *y* '
p9140
aS" 1 2 (I don't know what the clip is for, there isn't one on the other side) 3 4 5 This is the main model of the set, and again all the pieces are used bar these three, the spares"
p9141
aS" It's quite a nice model, although the car's a bit odd  Still, I like the ramps, and the colour scheme reminds me just a little of G1 Ultra Magnus  Hmm, I think that boom arm could do with refixing  "
p9142
aS" 1 2 Leftovers This is actually quite nice as well  It's that classic breakdown truck, and the boom arm itself is quite nice, with quite a bit of movement  Another solid model"
p9143
aS" 1 Leftovers I'm surprised by the amount of detail here actually  Not only have TLC included a spare wheel at the back, but also what looks like a trailer hitch, which all adds to the 'realism"
p9144
aS"' Another nice model to round out a nice set  And in the tub  Overall: I'm not sure which of the two I like better  When I bought them, and on the way home, I much preferred the train set"
p9145
aS" But after building this set, I'm not sure  This is another good set from the year when TLC seems to be giving us so many"
p9146
aS" There are some good pieces in here too, and while there's nothing unique, they're still good  So, thanks for reading, hope it helped someone, and if there are any requests, I'll see what I can do"

aS" (Sorry if some pictures are a litte bit dark, but i'm not really into photography and i got bad light here) Let's Start with the Dwarf's Mine Defender: Theme: Castle 2008 Set Name: Dwarf's Mine Defender Number: 7040 Pieces: 86 Price: ?9,99 (EUR) First, as always, the box: The back, a few instructions on how the defender works, for those how don't know ;-) : And the instructions: We continue with the minifigs, sorry i forgot to make a closeup of the dwarf: And finally the mine defender itself, i personally think it isn't as bad as maybe some people think"
p9190
aS' The chain for the catapult is great i think: I kinda love those controls, the mechanism with the rubbe rband actually works pretty well, but only on a not-glossy underground'
p9191
aS" That's pretty much all of it, it's small but i like it a lot  So let's go on to the tower raid now, which would be my absolute favorite of those new sets"
p9192
aS" -------------------------------------- Theme: Castle 2008 Set Name: Tower Raid Number: 7037 Pieces: 364 Price: ?29,99 (EUR) Again, first the box & Instructions: We got 2 sets of instructios here, one for the tower and one for the siege tower: The Minifigs, we got one archer and one soldier here, both with the torsos of the 2007 sets: Now thw orc side, starting with the great leader, with the new armor and the golden helmet (i love those pieces!): Closeup of the armor & helmet: Then we got another orc-knight: And the prisoner, with handcuffs! The Crownie Tower looks great overall, though there is something i don't really like about it, but later on that"
p9193
aS' Now the back, and that is what really bothers me, there areno walls on the first floor except the one with the wall-piece and the door, and theprison also is open at the back'
p9194
aS' The orc easily could jump out there: Not sure what these are all about, they really don\'t add much to the set: Enough rant now, let\'s go on with a pretty sweet detail, the golden crystal on the little table: The wall piece on the first floor you can ram in: And finally the very best thing of this set, the amazing orc siege tower! From the front: The great working ram, you can pull it back very far and it got pretty much power: Here we got another sweet detail, the siege "platform" that moves out by pulling a cord in the back of the tower: Finally a picture of a bit siege action: If you ram in the lower wallpiece, the brown shelfs of the prison-floor collapse and the prisoned orc is finally free! Summary: Likes: As i mentioned before, i really think that\'s the best ever produced siege tower, it\'s got so mich details and works extremely well, also the overall look of it is magnificant'
p9195
aS' The destroy-mechanism of the tower is pretty cool too, the brown door is a fine detail too'
p9196
aS" Nothing much to say about the mine defender, i like this little set, and there's nothing really to bother about it  Dislikes: The Back of the tower"
p9197
aS" That's really the only thing that's a bit bad imo, they could have put there 2 more walls on the first floor and something to lock the prison easily"
p9198
aS" Final Thought: The Tower Raid for me personally is the best of the 2008 sets so far, it's got great playability and looks simply good  My opinion: Buy it!"
p9199
aS"Tks for these cool reviews metalandi !! I love these orc sets !! I am so going to get these ;-) I'm happy to see that scared face again (I love it really !!) and the use of that handculfs !! That new armour looks really cool That tower is really nice and I wont mod it that much which os cool and the battle ram is freaking sweet !! Tks again for sharing ;-) *yoda*"
p9200
aS"Great review, pictures and all! Thanks for showing all the mechanisms of the tower, I didn't notice them from either the pics we had or the instructions--it didn't hit me that when you knock down the wall the second floor breaks"
p9201
aS' That is a genius idea  This looks like a superb set, unfortunately my priority right now is the Troll Warship  Still, if that really is U S'
p9202
aS' $80, I might skip it and go for this instead, which is only $20 US  One note, though  I think there might not be a back cage on the second floor of the tower so that the mechanism can work'
p9203
aS' Did you try to see if the second floor ground still falls if you add it a fourth cage wall? Also, you could just pretend that the tower is built against a mountainside'
p9204
aS' It would fit perfectly and add more defense to the Knights  Great review! :-) VK'

aS' Green Grocer Reviewed by Dunamis Set 10185 2,352 Pieces $149 95 from The LEGO Store (Glendale, CA) Build time 6'
p9326
aS'5 hours Holy guacamole! Almost exactly one year after Caf? Corner was released we get the third installment in the increasingly popular LEGO exclusive town series'
p9327
aS' Combined with the famous 10182 Caf? Corner and its trusty companion 10190 Market Street this trio makes the foundation for an amazing city block of LEGO goodness'
p9328
aS' For those new to this series of sets, check out my reviews of the two previous sets in this line: Cafe Corner Market Street I would not necessarily recommend reading too many of my reviews in one setting as you might experience loss of brain cells and/or drowsiness'
p9329
aS' You have been warned  So, how does Green Grocer stack up to the two previous sets you ask? Well, follow along kind reader and I shall attempt to unravel this question'
p9330
aS' The Box: The gigantic box is pretty standard and looks amazingly similar to the Caf? Corner box'
p9331
aS' The back of the box shows some of the features of the green grocer as well as a lot of the cool interior that was absent from the previous sets'
p9332
aS' In addition, we are shown an image of the three sets together and a small insert image showing how they connect together (as if we could not master that difficult maneuver?) Opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals'
p9333
aS' As it seems to be the norm now, we have the reusable cereal box type tab system that we saw so often in 2007 sets'
p9334
aS' However, upon opening the tabs we are pleasantly surprised to find a cardboard tray! Have not seen one of those in a while'
p9335
aS' As you can see in the photo, we have two 32x16 green base plates, three instruction manuals and a bunch of bags that are broken into four groups: Group 1 has 12 bags and goes with the first manual and builds the first floor'
p9336
aS' Group 2 has 9 bags and goes with the second manual to build the second floor  Group 3 has 14 bags and goes with the third manual for the top floor and roof'
p9337
aS' And one bag that is not numbered and hence you can open it whenever you feel like it  There are no stickers ? Yay! Moving right along, we get to the three instruction manuals'
p9338
aS' The Manuals: The three manuals are 55, 47 and 47 pages in length'
p9339
aS' They are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings: - Piece call outs for each step - Parts inventory at the end of the second manual - Page numbers Color separation in these manuals was fine for me except dark bley and black'
p9340
aS' We get a nice photo of all three sets together: Plus, we get a nice tip showing how to split up the bags and what goes where'
p9341
aS' Those additional pieces you see in the photo just below the numbered bags are the pieces that come from the single un-numbered bag (along with the base plates)'
p9342
aS' Parts list Random manual shot The Pieces: Upon opening the first set of bags, one thing is clear; there are a TON of little tiny pieces! The minifigs are included in this first section as well'
p9343
aS' Interesting to note that there are a handful of printed pieces and as I mentioned previously, no stickers  We also get a host of new and exciting pieces to add to our collection'
p9344
aS' Keep in mind my scope of LEGO sets is generally centered around Star Wars, Technic, Creator and the occasional racer set so what is new to me might have been around 15 years'
p9345
aS' At any rate, here are some of the more interesting pieces: Again, note the printed tiles  This time around, LEGO has decided to include 33% more minifigs than the Caf? Corner and Market Street sets'
p9346
aS' Yes, we get four minifigs instead of three! Here are the cast of characters: Pictured (left to right) is Sir Top Hat, Miss Jenny Blue Overalls, Patti O? Furniture and little Timmy Cub Scout'
p9347
aS' I?ll leave it up to the minifig aficionados to decipher which torsos are new and to tell us all about the hairpieces'
p9348
aS' I can say with reasonable certainty that the four yellow smiley heads are not new (somebody check that?) Don?t forget the lovable little cat named ?Tom?'
p9349
aS' He is the arch-rival of the mouse ?Jerry? that lives downstairs: Overall, there are a lot of pieces, large variety and wide range of colors'
p9350
aS' The Build: If you have either of the two previous sets, you will feel right at home here'
p9351
aS' Just like in the previous builds, it seems like the first ten build steps are consumed with laying a bunch of 1x1, 1x2 and 2x2 tiles everywhere'
p9352
aS' Almost feels like 30% of the pieces are used up right away (see below)  There are several sections where you build various parts of the interior'
p9353
aS' Take a look at the cash register/counter below: And the beverage cooler: And the produce stand and everything that goes in it: Looks like someone has mail: Looks like someone just had a baby: This set is incredibly well done and gives inspiration to go back and add similar items to Caf? Corner and Market Street'
p9354
aS' As before, the average builder is introduced to some new building techniques like using the hinge plates to make the angles on the front of the building as shown below: Also the top of the roof shows some interesting ideas: Overall, it is a really fun build that kept me entertained the whole way'
p9355
aS' The Design: This is a great set with lots of little details  I especially like the little mouse hole in the wall leading to the Jerry the mouse?s area'
p9356
aS' They even included a little slice of cheese! It seems the designers can?t get away from the ?usual? staircase which I always feel is way too big'
p9357
aS' Maybe future designs can incorporate a spiral staircase to save room for other things in the model'
p9358
aS' One welcome addition is the fire escape as seen below: I?m going to show a bunch of examples of various items in the set so you can get the feel of the amazing detail in this design'
p9359
aS' Take a look at the lamps (torches?) just outside the door: And the streetlight with fire hydrant: Brickwork and archway: Awning: Here is the back side of the building'
p9360
aS' Note the trashcans and yard tools: Here is a close-up of the railings on the second story balcony and the second photo is the finished product with curtains in the window'
p9361
aS' Nice use of cups to make the banister on the second floor: Here is the fireplace on the second floor: Second floor staircase with Tom?s hiding spot: Check out the radiator on the third floor: More third floor: Nice grandfather clock and rug (third floor) Check out the deck that is up on the roof'
p9362
aS' Complete with two chairs, table, umbrella, flower pots and grill: Interesting use of minifig hammers on the roof: Finally, here is what is left over when we?re done: A couple of shots of the front: A shot of the back: And here are all three together: Overall Thoughts: This is an incredible set and the best of the three in my opinion'
p9363
aS' It is hard to top Caf? Corner but I believe Green Grocer just did  I absolutely love all the details and building techniques that went into making this set'
p9364
aS' There is a ton of different parts and wide color selection  As usual, we get a bunch of tiles and small plates, but that goes with the series'
p9365
aS' Also, we get four minifigs and lots of minifig accessories  I?m giving this set a score of 100%! I thought about it and I really don?t know how they could have made it any better'
p9366
aS' In short, RUN don?t walk to go pick this set up! Final Rating: 100% Build 10/10 (Excellent - Lots of nice interiors, details and accessories to build ) Functionality 10/10 (Outstanding'
p9367

aS" town plan? My impression is that out of the box, at least, they don't  Which is too bad"
p9432
aS" However, I don't think it would be hard to mod the Town Plan so it looks like it belongs in the same town as CC/GG/MS  These sets, to me, are what I have always wanted from TLC as an adult"

aS' Looks like you have the original 1989 version with the yellow top cylinders  :-) I got one too several years ago, although I probably paid too much for it'
p9499
aS" :-P On a side note, if that pneumatic tubing feels harder and stiffer than the modern type, I highly recommend that you don't use it and buy some of the newer stuff off Bricklink instead"
p9500
aS' TLC originally used a different material for the tubes and this stuff degrades the nozzles (on pistons, switches and so on) over time'
p9501
aS" The old tubes also grip the nozzles much more firmly and if you aren't careful when removing them, it's actually possible to rip off the nozzles completely"

aS" It was use in so few sets (I believe 8851 contained one as well?) and I still don't know why it's better than any other axle  The purpose of the threaded axle is to carry tension"
p9513
aS' Regular axles are used primarily for carrying torsion (for gears), sometimes for compression (8855 landing gear, helicopter skids), and sometimes just for looks (roll cages, canopies)'
p9514
aS' But used in tension, connectors will usually just pop off'
p9515
aS' With the threads and the corresponding nuts, this part can be used to squeeze parts together (like the pen in the plotter of 8094), or to hold heavy assemblies onto turntables (like 8862 and 8851)'

aS' With the power crane (8854) reviewed here, that is the complete list of sets which used this part  I wrote about it here: http://www ericalbre   1984 html#Parts Eric'
p9517
aS' As I bought it, I didn\'t even know I would also get a box  It just said: all parts with building instructions  After opening the parcel I was like: "woah    woooaaahhh" and so on'

aS" Nice pictures  I also sort out the pieces the same way if I'm rebuilding a model"

aS" You can also rig up the Technic flag sticker that it comes with to the main model  I've done that on mine"
p9599
aS" You may want to reinforce it with tape if you're going to leave the model on display though, as it will break up over time due to UV exposure like many stickers do"

p9601
aS' the only original stickers are the front headlight-patterns on the 2 red 1x2 bricks'

p9603

p9604
aS" Thanks for reviewing this classic set  I got it when it first came out and still love it: the suspension, steering and robust look of the model haven't been done that well ever since"
p9605
aS' This set puzzled me though, back in the days  The rear suspending part containing the differential and some gears was shown different on the box from the instructions'
p9606
aS' In the instructions it showed that the (grey part of the suspension) in the back had to be made using a 1x2 smooth tile and 4 cornerplates (2x2) in grey'
p9607
aS' The box however showed a much sturdier solution using a 1x8 tile and a 1x8 plate  It is also visible on the cover of the instructions'

p9612

aS") Maybe it's unusual, but this section of the drive train didn't hold that well on my model: This is how it looks now: The parts made redundant were left in the built model, that's why there's that useless 8-tooth gear there :P"

aS" Hello, my dear friends! Here's something new  I am actually making a review with pictures! Yes, I got a new camera for christmas"
p9676
aS" Now I was testing to see how the camera would reflect, so some of the pics are a bit blurry  I have based this review from Dunamis's reviews  He is my inspiration"
p9677
aS'So, without further ado, I bring you the Review! Set #: 7693 Name: ETX Alien Strike Price: $19 99, ?12,99 Pieces: 246 Box: Okay, so as you can see below, the Box is pretty simple'
p9678
aS" As always, European versions won't have the Piece count, name, etc, just the Number I believe  Mine, having the American Version, has the info on it"
p9679
aS" as you can see, it has the Classic MM logo, and the red Planet, as well as the set in a pose itself  Very Nice  I linked it because the Pic wasn't resizing  http://www brickshel   ke/dscn0017"
p9680
aS'jpg Below is the back of the box  It shows the other sets and some features of this set  Contents: Next we have the Contents'
p9681
aS' This set includes a medium sized DSS (xwingyoda), a bag labeled one, and HUGE bag labeled two, the 1 bag contains a smaller bag, and the two bag includes two smaller bags  5 bags in all'
p9682
aS' Also pictured are the instructions  I have linked it due to the non-resize  http://www brickshel   ke/dscn0019 jpg Figs: Included in this set are three figs  Two jellies, and 1 astro'
p9683
aS' The jeelies are fine, but I pefer the LoM ones  But they glow  Those new alien commanders for Summer look promising though  The astro is nice, and includes an extra gold Visor'
p9684
aS' MOC ON! Astro Miner: In all MM sets there is a human and alien set  The Astro par of this set is a Mini-miner  Here is a pic of construction and that wonderful space logo sticker'
p9685
aS' Not Much of a cockpit  :-/ Finished Miner(The set number, too): Overall I like the miner, and It is nicely designed  I feel the cockpit is lacking though'
p9686
aS' Aliens: The alien Vehical is the Main part of the set  This pic shows the beginning steps  Solid and sturdy  But those four axles/pin parts(blue) are pointless'
p9687
aS" No support, and they don't get used at all  Nice TLC  :-| Now we get cooking! This pic shows the tail added on and the more bulk being built"
p9688
aS' We get a little repetitive and build the craft up in this pic  And this pic from the instructions shows how the alien craft transforms for battle  The completed set and extra bits'
p9689
aS' Parts: 8/10 Figs 8/10 Price Per Piece ration: 9/10 Playability: 9/10 Overall: 85% The alien craft is great  The attack feature is nice and there are a ton of trans green parts'
p9690
aS" The alien falls out of the cockpit when turned upside down  I love this set, and it's perfect for MM fans or beginners It has nice parts, and read the above part for more details"

p9828

aS' Hello All Apologize for digging out a such old post'
p9846
aS' Recently I got a bag of Lego Technic parts where there have been mixed three sets: 8858, 8829 and 8235 The resurrection of 8858 has been described by me in a separate post'
p9847
aS' Going back to the Dune Buggy  when I saw it for the first time back in 1994 I did not like it, as I was always big fan of 8840 (which I consider to the day the best looking Buggy) and set 8829 looked to me ugly'
p9848
aS' So there were those all parts in the bag then I though why not build it ? And I started to do it  When I finished I was very surprised how the final look of this set is! Really taking my words back'
p9849
aS' Unfortunately in the bag there were missing some parts and I could not rebuild the back spoiler  So I made some changes to it and make it from spare parts that I have and it came out acceptable'
p9850
aS' I also added some additional parts such as fake steering wheel, Rally logo, antennas'
p9851
aS' I have also reverse mounting of the rear tires  why Lego did them like that I never know  as I think they look better this way'
p9852
aS' Set: well the review has been already made by owner of this post so I will only add few things into it'
p9853
aS' Engine  V2 (aired cooled?) is driven by 4 gears -> from the single wheel (no differential as in 8840) using two old school z14 tooth bevel , then by z24 tooth crown and z8 tooth type 1'
p9854
aS' Actually the (as in most old sets) the pistons are moving very fast (not as in current sets) and smooths  I needed to extra clean all engine parts as there was a lot friction'
p9855
aS' Suspension  set has engine bay working using two old gray shock absorbers 6,5l  the movement is not big but works very nice, better then in 8840 in my opinion'
p9856
aS' Steering  this is a bit odd as there is no direct connection to HoG as in most old sets, but first the gear rack is moved by z8 then two z14 tooth where reverse movement is taking place'
p9857
aS' Later connection of two old school z14 tooth bevel goes to HoG Details  this is the most that I like in this set, specially how the use of axle pin connector perpendicular and 1x10 bricks with 3x3 cut corners and plate 1x5 toothed ends 2 studs with center axle hole are making the body shape  is just wonder'
p9858
aS' Tires  the balloon rear are pretty nice the front is a new version of those that were in 8840  What I do not like: 1  Missing of Technic Figure (8840 had it ) 2'
p9859
aS' no steering wheel in the original set 3  no differential  but having in mind that Lego has introduce 24-12 teeth would be difficult to build the transmission in such small space where the engine is'
p9860
aS' I will shortly upload new pictures and post them here later on '
p9861
aS' Over all  I think it is worth buying it as it is very payable ! Actually very payable and runs smoothly , the steering, suspension  perfect Thank you and regards'

aS' I never did get it though as Lego was so expensive in Australia then; I had around 2000 pieces and I thought I had loads! :-D Anyway, last year I bought 8455, which I love; it works great with a compressor I made too! *sweet* I wish mine had a real cab though'

aS" The turntable on the back doesn't turn very well though, as the weight is all distributed on one side  The screw axle prevents it from popping off but there is still a lot of friction in it"

aS' I like your nomenclature for the BJST  Acronyms always sound nicely scientific; much better than "digger"  No one would know you made it up until they found out what it means'
p10121
aS' I also really like what I will call your "kinetic photos"  They convey a sense of motion and show the range of the mechanism without the big file sizes of animations'
p10122
aS' How long of a shutter speed did you use? The secret to not getting too much friction in the turntable is using extra nuts and jamming them together'
p10123
aS" You don't want to actually clamp the nuts tight across the turntable"
p10124
aS' You want to jam two nuts tightly together at each end which prevents them from unwinding, but still leave a little free play (gap)'
p10125
aS' This way it will hold the assembly together but not prevent it from moving  Mine moves quite easily  This same concept is used on the pen plotter or 8094  "Slewed"? I think that\'s a word'

aS"Very good review! These sets are a lot better than I expected, and for $20, I might have to pick up both! My family and I are going to Orlando this summer, hopefully I'll pick these and some other sets up at the Lego Store in Downtown Disney"
p10333
aS' :-D'
p10334
aS' As promised, and with only a single day of delay is my review of the 2008 set: 4994 Creator Fierce Creatures'
p10335
aS" This small set is the same size and price range as last year's 4939 Cool Cars reviewed by prateek and dillthepill"
p10336
aS' The box General info You get 193 pieces (vs 206 for Cool Cars) which is quite a lot, but most of them are small  There are a lot of hinges and some good slopes and wings'
p10337
aS' The building instructions contains three models, but no further ideas for inspiration'
p10338
aS' Primary model: Spider The first model is a big spider which shares some similarities to the secondary model of 4895 Power in the design'
p10339
aS' The legs each have 3 joints, where the ones in the middle have "stud joints" to be moved sideways while the rest use hinges for all joints'
p10340
aS' There are 8 of them and it does get a little tedious with all the repetitive building in this relatively small model'
p10341
aS' I like the design of the face with a lot of eyes and a big and ugly mouth, but the real gem is the X-pattern on the opisthosoma made using double/inverted slopes'
p10342
aS' It is poseable and I think it looks more "fierce" when inverted  Secondary model: Snake The face of the snake is nicely detailed with a splitting tongue and a mouth than can move a little'
p10343
aS' There is a problem with the construction  It uses stacked hinges for some of the joints, which are hard to pull apart without stressing the pieces'
p10344
aS" Tertiary model: Fly I'm not completely sure what this insect is  I will say it's a fly, although the tail and head are too pointy  This is a neat little thing"
p10345
aS' Conclusion Primary model: 8 It is a good design, but lacks some sturdiness in the legs  They fall off a little too easily'
p10346
aS" Secondary models: 6 They are pretty good when you look at the bricks that are available, but they don't wow you in any way and they suffer from the same issues as the primary model regarding sturdiness"
p10347
aS' Alternate models: 3 It is hard to come up with alternate models with so many small pieces and plates that are only 1 stud wide  The colors might make you want to build a Spyrius space ship'
p10348
aS' Playability: 8 The models have many movable joints and you can put quite a scare into your minifigs when their town gets attacked by these creatures    unless some EN forces are there to protect them'
p10349
aS" Price: 6 Creator sets are known for their great price to bricks ratio, but this set doesn't quite measure up to sets like Cool Cars"
p10350
aS" Pieces: 7 The pieces aren't great by themselves, but who doesn't need a fist full of hinges, slopes and basic plates in standard colors? I don't think this is a must-have set like the big rig was last year"
p10351
aS' The pieces are great and it has a nice primary model, but the set lacks a bit when it comes to the usual strong Creator qualities like alternate models and price'

aS"Enchanted Island 6278 Pictorial Review Original price: $66 Pieces: 412 Figures: 7 This 1994 set marked the beginning of a new era for Lego Pirates - it became a theme more centralised around playability and not so much grand ol' ships"
p10366
aS' 6278 Enchanted Island was the flagship set of the Islanders subtheme, heavily based around Polynesian and Native American concepts (In fact, TLC was successfully sued by a number of tribes for using bastardised Maori names, such as Kahuka)'
p10367
aS' It was released as a Legend set in 2001, but due to poor sales was discontinued again  The largest of the Islander sets, Enchanted Island is a portion of an island with a river running through'
p10368
aS' The left hand side features some sturdy buildings built into a tree-like structure on a rocky outcrop, whilst the left hand side features a tower built out of "wooden" posts and a large tribal statue'
p10369
aS" The box cover shows all the details; it does, however, differ from the instructions' finished product in that it has been more aesthetically arranged - bushes e t c"
p10370
aS' have been moved to fill in gaps and to not obscure other things'
p10371
aS' The sides of the box show nothing particularly special, although in one scene it depicts the Islander Canoe chasing the Pirate boat with the treasure; just one way to play with the set'
p10372
aS" The back of the box, however, is superb, featuring a large number of alternative models: a toothy statue, a Pirate tree (think Wolfpack) with an Islander base, Kahuka's throne, a fire-breathing statue and a souped-up boat for the pirates"
p10373
aS' These, and many more, can be easily made because of the large diversity of pieces'
p10374
aS" The set has a huge number of minifigures for its size, the third highest number in the Pirate range (The SES and the BSB being first and second, respectively) - a whopping 7! 5 Islanders, including the all-too-common King Kahuka, the elusive Islander babe and 3 standard warriors - this set alone will never leave you short of enemies! 2 pirates, Ironhook in his standard attire with a scurvy dog at his side attack the island, although they are only moderately armed - 2 cutlasses and a pistol between them; a musket would've been nice"
p10375
aS' The Islanders, on the other hand, have 4 shields, a bow and quiver and 6 spears, not to mention the big pokey thing with horns on top (Weapon? Idol? Staff?)'
p10376
aS' A monkey, parrot and crocodile provide the obvious creature features, with a fair amount of gold to finish off'
p10377
aS" In the instructions, the goblet does not have the lid, although it does on the box; it's a nice touch anyway - adding a little more diversity to the monotonous treasure stashes"
p10378
aS" The pirates' boat is a nice 2 sail vessel, with oars for when the wind stops and a treasure map  The sails are similar to those in Lagoon Lockup, but with an extra front sail"
p10379
aS" It's an awesome little boat, better for raids than a rowing boat, but not too big that it can't sail up rivers  It can comfortably fit 2 men and, at a squeeze, 5"
p10380
aS" The sails are expensive if you buy them seperately; normally this won't be a problem, but they can cost aroun $5 each  The Islanders' boat is a canoe with a sail and an outrigger to stabilise it"
p10381
aS' The sail is beautifully done, with 2 spars taughtening it  There is a clip for the rower to leave his weapon when at se and the mast can turn to get as much wind as possible'
p10382
aS" It's quite a top-heavy boat, but it doesn't look hideous and without the mast/sail it looks great  3 Islanders can fit in it, and more if they sit on the outrigger"
p10383
aS' The markings on the canoe are stickers, but they look fine and are probably more robust than markings for their job'
p10384
aS" Furthermore, they're waterproof! *sing* Kahuka's throne can be carried by 2 loyal subjects      "
p10385
aS'Or strapped to his pet crocodile! The clips on the side can be used to rest his weaponry, or hold spears for battle'
p10386
aS" The throne looks nice, although I'm not too sure about the blue against the red - I'd have prefered white as it would clash less  "
p10387
aS' An overview of the island; it is built in 2 halves - left then right and then joined together loosley, so it can be seperated for transporting'
p10388
aS' Around the back to the left and right, there are large open spaces that are great for battles - this set isn\'t so much about a large solid build, but creating a "village" - smaller structures linked by bridges'
p10389
aS' And the back    To the far left is a platform built onto the rock, with access from the river via a ladder'
p10390
aS" There's the standard Islander drum with the lovely zebra-skin part (Where did they get that?!)  I've never understood the white flag - I was under the impression it was used for surrender  "
p10391
aS' Further along the rocky bank, there are some hinged palm leaves that swing upwards to reveal      '
p10392
aS"The treasure! It's an OK hiding place; not the best place to hide it, right where the pirates sail past, but it feels fabulous; it fits right in  Above it on the rocky bank is the main structure"
p10393
aS' It looks very disjointed when you build it (bricks all over the place), but once it\'s done it looks nice and rural, with leaves everywhere and the "balcony" where Kahuka is standing'
p10394
aS" You get a nice roof made from 2 large palm leaves tilting down  Around the back there's a slight shelter, a table for picnics and a ladder to access the upstairs"
p10395
aS' I was rather annoyed that it is so open, but the set is designed from just one perspective    To the left is the bridge to the other building  '
p10396
aS' A nice, one piece bridge made of the softer plastic used for muskets and the post-1991 cutlasses'
p10397
aS" It looks good, but be warned! It tilts when you pull a pin, sending the pirates flying! This contraption is a good idea, but it is very stiff and so doesn't swing, even when burdened by a minifigure - you'll want to modify this bit if you get it"
p10398
aS' The other building looks like it is made out of posts and beams'
p10399
aS' They are all red; brown would have been better, but it would have added too many colours to the range, just like the use of black for trees in some forestmen sets'
p10400
aS" There are 3 clips for spare weapons; only 2 of these will ever be used when all the Islanders are armed, but it gives the pirates scope once they've been disarmed  "
p10401
aS"There's another nice palm tree roof on top  2 ladders give access  "
p10402
aS"there's a total of 4 in this set - worth getting, eh? Although they're 5p on Bricklink, for a KABOB, they're like gold! At the top there's another hidey hole; the palm leaves lift up on hinges to show the treasure or hiding Islander"
p10403
aS" It can be seen from behind, but this set is designed from one perspective only  Nice cattlehorns too   alongside the slats you can see in the floor - 5 years later and it would've been a solid plate "
p10404
aS" The big statue is one of the main selling point of this set, alongside the tilting bridge - they're the action features shown in every catalogue at the time, but it is not really special, just original"
p10405
aS' The statue fits in with the theme perfectly - Kahuka\'s mask, his shield and this statue all depict the same deity, which is a nice "collectible" idea'
p10406
aS' The back is rather plain, except the angled 1x1 bricks - a good touch'
p10407
aS" I'm not sure why there's a black brick in the back of the head, but this is easily remedied; it could even be done with a brick from this same set, just swapping the two over  "
p10408
aS' Aside from the head turning, the back can open to store sacred objects, or, in my opinion, prisoners, hence the gaps for breathing'
p10409
aS" Either way, it's a lovely piece of architecture and deservedly a flagship element of the set"
p10410
aS" There's your standard cooking pot floating around, although a 1x1 yellow stud as human flesh (remember, minifigs are yellow, no matter what the licensed themes say!) is a superb finish"
p10411
aS" This set is a stunning set for both kids and AFOLs who are just getting back into Lego/Pirates - it is a great army builder and, due to its release as a Legend, is extremely cheap on eBay - you should be able to pick one up for 18, or 15 if you're lucky"
p10412
aS" For that you get a lifetime's supply of Islanders, 4 ladders, some wall panels, 2 baseplates (one raised and both with rivers and printed vegetation around the edge), a ton of weapons, a fair quantity of standard bricks, but most of all, a heap of vegetation: This is an easy to buy set, with normally around 5 on eBay at any time, and is well worth it, for the parts, the play and the nostalgia! It can be easily modified; when used in conjunction with any other outpost, a much larger fortress can be made, especially if more rope bridges are used"
p10413
aS" if you pick 2 of this fine set off eBay (It'll still be less than the original price!), a huge complex can be constructed, giving you an instantaneous village for around 35"

p10517
aS' How could I rate it, but awesome? A little Islander "army", the islander girl, Ironhook and that cool boat with two sails, the jail-polynesian statue'
p10518
aS' I must recognize that I have a thing with the Islanders  I know that they are weird, poorly based on the polynesian aborigens, etc'
p10519
aS' But they are very original, broke with the traditional enemies, and gave to the Pirates theme an exotic and wild look '
p10520
aS'I realized that building the chess set from the new pirates theme, they are two grey heads that reminded me of the king kahuna throne, which goes to say that I am hoping they bring back new sets, I just wish they were bigger'
p10521
aS' I would love to build the old ones, but I would side more towards the newer model if they ever released them '
p10522
aS' What an amazing (old) set! I loved Pirates in my childhood, but that was before the Islander and Spanish stuff    mine were the BSB and soldier fortress with the big baseplate'
p10523
aS' As I\'m now returning to Pirates, I\'ve tracked down most of the 2009 sets and of course bought the new 2015 sets    but knowing I missed this "middle" period of Islanders vs Pirates makes me a bit sad'
p10524
aS'   those Islanders are soooo "Monkey Island" (those of my age likely feel the same) to my eyes! Oh for a "Lemonhead" minfig  '
p10525
aS" ;) I'm curious now how much this set sells for, given it was apparently one of very few Lego actually re-released! I recently bought a MISB BSB that was an early 2000's re-release, and it was very pricey"
p10526
aS' but then, I suspect the BSB has a LOT more of a nostalgic following these days than this set! Can anyone give me a rough idea what this set goes for in as-new condition these days? Regardless, a fantastic review with some great photos of the whole set and minifigs'
p10527
aS'   even though this is an old thread, I am glad someone else bumped it recently so I can add my thoughts too'
p10528
aS' :) One thing I\'ve noticed comparing the newest Pirates sets to the 80\'s ones I had as a kid (and these from the 90\'s) is the move away from baseplates and big "panel" pieces'
p10529
aS' I actually like that in a lot of ways; whilst I miss baseplates being included as they are a great starting point for creating new things (and make the sets easier to "play" with), visually, I think Lego-designed model sets look better without them'

aS' A Technic freak really should own it'
p10641
aS' Anyway: 8421 has more than twice as much parts as 8460, is motorized, features a V6-engine and a very neat mechanism to extend the crane/boom twice using a braided string with end studs'
p10642
aS' Try to find out how! Of course 8421 features (far) more than 8460'
p10643
aS' IMHO 8421 should have been a copy of 8460, a set so successful that it has been rereleased two times, but the designers overshoot the mark  8421 is a (breathtaking) monster'
p10644
aS' Compared to it, 8460 looks cute - not pale! #9 final thoughts: I got it on eBay in kind of good condition, for about 50 dollars  I know that it has been worth the money in any point of view'
p10645
aS' *wub* I didnt use the word old-school for now'

aS' I do own the 8421 and I can tell you: this 8460 is much, much stronger, it can carry more weight because the boom is lighter then the 8421: they are powered by the same two pistons  '
p10662

aS' Does the hook lower without having to pull it? If it does, you succeeded in constructing the set right'
p10664
aS' The alternate model was great fun too, the pump is cleverly hidden and the crane folds up great between the cab and the loading platform'

p10697
aS" I realise that it has trouble even holding up itself, but ultimately it doesn't matter as it's not like you are really going to construction work with it"

Or just put it up on blocks next to a trailer and you've got a nice trailer-trash section of town"

aS'Set ref: 7626 Name: Jungle Cutter Number of minifigs: 4 Number of pieces: unknown Price: 39,99 A general view of the set: Weve got 5 giant ants, two Russian soldiers, a General, Indy of course, 3 trees, a small entrance of a cave, and the debroussaillor vehicle (I dont know the English name of it)'
p10976
aS' You cant enter into the cave, because there is a spider web with its spiderUnless Unless you know how the mechanism works and the spider web go up And reveals a case with diamonds and accessories'
p10977
aS' A closer view on the mechanism (which is simple but works well), and you can also see the difference, or maybe the same, size of a spider and a giant ant! And Ive always thought that those spiders were very big compared to the minifigs! So those ants are really giant! Poor small frog! The three trees with the entrance make a nice jungle layout! Dont speak too loud, you will wake up the soldier Dont worry for him, he will be waken up by the vehicle before being eaten by those giant ants! A front view, making the vehicle really menacing! A back view: Push the red part from the back and there are two parts that fall down from the vehicle'
p10978
aS' I dont know why The movie will clarify this I think And here you can see how the two big circular blades turn when you push the vehicle Simple but effective! Run Indy, run! This set is really nice'

aS'   Im a city mocer, and not an Indy fan'
p10982
aS' So I dont have bought the temple, the bigger set of the series, because it has nothing special for me in term of part selections or in the design, in relation with the town theme, and because my supermarket doesnt have it yet! So, we are waiting for a member to review it and make the part 4'

aS"Yay, go Dragon Masters! I have to agree with iamded, I do like the Black Knights sets better for their design ( betrayal! ), however, the Dragon Knights are just awesome, 'cause they have dragons! This is a nice set, with some awesome minifigs and a nice overall design"
p11130
aS' I wish I had it    Go Masters!'
p11131
aS" Agent Rick: You're definately the Dragon Master around these parts  What a great little set  I really like the classic dragon which reminds me of a similar style used for the Lego crocodiles"
p11132
aS' And the dungeon is pretty slick too  I like the use of the large gates plus the doors  Plus the set contains the blue wizard  Awesome! Great review '
p11133
aS' Great Classic Dragon Den! I love the old green dragons very much! There were my fave  I love these theme very much after the Black Knights era'

p11150
aS' Maybe because they were dark grey and dark grey pieces seemed a bit hard to come by at the time  I always assumed that the dragon was, sort of, the mascot of the Dragon Masters'
p11151
aS" The wizard was there to keep him under control so he wouldn't turn on them"
p11152
aS' I always figured that the wizard was working with the Dragon Master King, and they were fighting against the Royal Knights (the dudes with the lion faces on their torsos), or whatever they were called'
p11153
aS' I like this set a lot  I think the castle theme declined after the Dragon Masters and Royal Knights themes were discontinued  The new knights never really took the cake'
p11154
aS" It's funny, but it seems, to me anyways, that when the Lego Minifigs lost their regular smile/smirk faces (whether they were masked by a beard or not), that's when Lego began to decline   a bit"
p11155
aS' The Dragon Masters had their vicious faces and all, but they still had that smile/smirk underneath their rough exteriors  The new knights look a little   less confident '
p11156
aS' I own this set and I think its a great for a smaller fortress building'
p11157
aS' There is a good selection of mini figs, the BURPS do detract somewhat from the set, but they do make it feel as if its in a large cave'
p11158
aS' The cloth flags that are included are really nice and mine have lasted a long time '
p11159
aS" The 8291 Dirt Bike comes from a long line of Technic bikes, and I think it's the best ever  It looks great, and it's fun to ride around in the house"
p11160
aS' I hoped to find a figure the right size for it, but none of mine would fit  Unlike a lot of Technic models, it looks good from all angles'
p11161
aS' Considering the size of the model it has a complicated way of connecting the engine to the wheel  The rear shocks are just the right stiffness       and they have a good amount of travel'
p11162
aS' I thought these shocks were new  I need to get out more    Functions: Shocks: Two front, one stiffer one in the rear  Drivetrain: 2 piston engine linked to the rear wheel via gears and a chainlink'
p11163
aS' Steering: Yes it does    Stand: Retractable'
p11164
aS" For the price, size and subject, what else could be added? 10/10 Parts: Considering that it has three shocks and a 40 chainlinks it's a great set for parts"
p11165
aS' Some hard to use large parts are included, but they are not overused'
p11166
aS" The usage of the green does limit part usage somewhat though, and I'll be struggling to find a use for those wheels for anything other than a motorbike  8/10 Price: At $39"
p11167
aS"99 AUD for 248 parts it isn't the best value set  The US price is $25 00 which is somewhat better  It does have some more complicated parts however"
p11168
aS' 7/10 Looks: Lego seems to be moving away from the see-though look for Technic sets and this is a good example of it'
p11169
aS" I'm not a big fan of fairings but I think they work great in this set as a fuel tank  8/10 Fudge: This set was great for me as I have never had a Technic bike"
p11170
aS' However for those that want this for just parts or have other bikes it could be a hard sell'
p11171
aS" The alternate model (a chopper) is a complete rebuild (which I didn't make), and it's great that Lego have been including these most of the time lately  7/10 Overall: Recommended  8/10"
p11172
aS' I think the green motocross bike looks great  I like the use of fairings on this bike  The only thing I really don\'t like about the Technics bikes in general, is the "clumsy" design of the chaindrive'
p11173
aS' It sticks way to much out to the side  If they made a really big bike model, it would be more in place with this chain drive'
p11174
aS' I\'m not sure if it wouldn\'t be possible to design a shaft drive to the rear wheel, ala BMW style  But the green "Kawasaki" look great with the front and rear suspension'
p11175
aS' I have the Street Bike, 8420, a somewhat larger and more complicated set, and will probably add the motocross bike to my collection soon'
p11176
aS' It would be great if Lego could make a line of bikes, like they do the Ferrari line  Front'
p11177
aS' I saw this set at my TRU for only $20 00  Now I might go get it! Thanks sinner for another nice review! Quote hoped to find a figure the right size for it, but none of mine would fit'

p11227
aS' It allows the single motor to be used for two functions  This system has been around for a while, and Lego seem to be using it more and more'
p11228
aS' The Transmission Driving Ring alone (the red circle) goes for $5-15 USD on BrickLink, and you also need the Catch and Clutch Gear so I have been buying sets that have them instead'
p11229

p11232

p11235
aS' You can also see the white Clutch that connects the transmission to the motor to avoid burnouts  It goes decently high, and can go a bit higher if you use the crane arm'

aS" Compared to last years fire truck  (If I didn't buy the fire truck for half price I would have been annoyed that Lego brought out what is almost a motorised version of the same set"

aS" Oddly mine seemed to be missing a Axle Pin with Friction, but since it includes extra parts for the alternate model I didn't mind using one of my spares"
p11245
aS" On the subject of the alternate model, it is a dump truck which is made out to be a total re-build, but it isn't"

aS' This set has come under criticism for being overpriced - myself included - but the official piece count is 900 plus, which is pretty good considering it also contains the baseplate'
p11326
aS' 6 big bags and 2 of those 12x12 bricks in dark tan  (Note: set does not contain live Black Jungle Panther) The DSS, helpfully comes pre-scrunched thanks to TLC'
p11327
aS" Even in a $AUD150 set they can't get that right    sigh  The dark tan baseplate  Say what you like, I'm in love"
p11328
aS" I know some people don't like these, but they were such a staple of Castle/ Pirates for so many years that I don't consider them a juniorised piece at all"
p11329
aS" This one, recycled from the 05 Police HQ and 06 Hospital, is much better in design than the King Leo's Castle one as the different heights and asymmetry make it look much more like a natural piece of ground"
p11330
aS" Perfect for MOCs  And it's dark tan - how could anyone not love such a huge slab of dark tan? Note this love doesn't extend to applying the stonework stickers which are, frankly, crap"
p11331
aS' Random instructions page: Part 3: Temple of Doom - or just a doomed temple? The complete set, front view'
p11332
aS" Isometricish view: Back view: Top view: First impressions? It's very dark tan, isn't it? And green  And bright green  And dark green  And dark red  And normal tan  And dark bley"
p11333
aS" And pearl gold! In fact, it's a bit of a mish-mash of colours  I'm of two minds about this"
p11334
aS" I kind of prefer the palette to be a bit subtler, but I can see that a playset designed for kids isn't going to sell bucketloads all tastefully done in shades of tan with lashings of dark-green foliage"
p11335
aS" There's a huge amount of dark red in this set, which is always a welcome colour, but I'm not convinced it quite works with the 2 shades of tan on offer here"
p11336
aS" On the plus side, there's also a huge amount of dark tan in ordinary 2x2 bricks, tiles, plates and 1x1 and 1x2x3 slopes, which is great for anyone wanting to stock up  Let's take a closer look"
p11337
aS" I'll do this roughly in order of the build itself: a) The big scary face  This is a simple, fun build and very effective at projecting menace at the temple entrance"
p11338
aS' It actually detaches very easily from the temple (as pictured on the box art) to allow easier access to the inside'
p11339
aS" The eyes are flick-fire missiles, with Scary Face's hair conveniently providing ammo refills should you run out  All in all, from me"
p11340
aS" (b) The Back Spin the skelly head and stone steps appear - we haven't seen this feature in a while  Nice to get these pieces in dark bley"
p11341
aS" A conquistador hides under the stairs - this is a bit useless as the stairs can't fully extend while he's there   Moving right  "
p11342
aS' a trapdoor - what could possibly be behind it??!!??!!? Answer: not much, really  A little red stair  I really like these 2 stickers though - very intricate'
p11343
aS' The staircase leads to what I like to think of as the Crystal Skull Transmogrification Chamber'
p11344
aS" Now, I know nothing about the movie except that it's supposed to be have a kind of 50s B-movie plot rumoured to feature (look away, spoiler-haters)      aliens"
p11345
aS' These weird, creepy gold chairs look made from the bones of aliens if you ask me, with their strange vertebrae and silver claws'
p11346
aS" It wouldn't surprise me if bringing these aliens back to life was part of the plot of the movie    hence the crystal skull? I guess we'll find out May 22"
p11347
aS' In any case, transforming aliens clearly like a disco whirl as when you pull the handle, the whole of this assembly spins giddily around'
p11348
aS" A very clever and simple trick - it's basically just a wheel under the platform but the effect is great  Also under here is a bottomless pit (stickered)  "
p11349
aS' I would very much expect a villian to be thrown down it at some point  "So, do you come here often?" "I don\'t know who designed this club  These chairs are REALLY uncomfortable " NB'
p11350
aS' I am really, really over those pearl gold 1x2 roof corner slopes which started popping up in the 2006 Castle range, infected Exo-Force and have now spread here'
p11351
aS' Can we please have these in a different colour? Or a different pearl gold piece? Pretty please? ( c) Left tower (looking from the front) A small tower with a trans clear gem'
p11352
aS" (d) Right tower Waterfall with booby trap  I like the sticker, it's very cartoony, which fits with the set somehow"
p11353
aS' When you turn the wheel, flick fire missiles spray out and hit whoever is on the stairs  Both towers have a trap where if you move the skull, another one pops out from the dragon mouth'
p11354
aS" (e) Central turret thing This thing is kind of annoying and doesn't really sit or work well  It's kind of like a laser beam sending messages to space, I guess"
p11355
aS" As the central dome rises, the two plates peel away  I find it is a little bit tight to work smoothly and the two plates doesn't really sit well together at the top  Maybe I just need to rebuild it"
p11356
aS" I'm sure this will also be explained in the movie"
p11357
aS" (f) Final trap - the stair that isn't there The final trap is at the front - as Indy goes down the staircase, you can push the red heads and all the 1x8 bley bricks come tumbling down"
p11358
aS" Simple and works well  (g) Alternate view Here's how it looks as pictured on the box with the head removed  As you can see, this allows better access to the centre of the temple"
p11359
aS' As you can see, sadly there is nothing actually interesting there except a staircase to the turret and 2 dark tan slopes which are just stuck there and look a little out of place'
p11360
aS" I mean, come on, everything else has a splash of dark red and gold! Your Destination: Nowhere! Part 4: In Conclusion So after all those endless pics, what about the set itself? CONS:As a playset, 7627 doesn't quite make sense"
p11361
aS' Admittedly, the traps that are there are well-designed and unobtrusive'
p11362
aS" On the other hand, there's a great big whopping entrance at the front - but I wasn't sure if the figs are supposed to sneak in through the backdoor and go up the spiral staircase and past the waterfall (as shown in the box art) or if they were meant to end up in the golden skull room"
p11363
aS" The middle area doesn't really connect with anything, nor does the giant space turret"
p11364
aS" It may be that some of these questions are answered in the film, but whereas with 7624, 7625 and 7626 I could at least picture a story myself (eg with River Chase is fairly obvious what's happening - a chase down a river with a croc and a communist staking them out)!, the Temple set is a little all over the place"
p11365
aS' The design feels a little off to me - not really bad but not really great either  PROS: On the plus side, the natives and crystal skulls themselves are great'
p11366
aS' At 900+ pieces, this is also a great parts pack for dark tan, dark red, plant pieces, gold oddments etc  I especially love the baseplate in that shade'
p11367
aS' I like the overall shape of the temple - a big staircase with secret nooks and crannies  The build is reasonably interesting and there are some clever tricks with the traps'
p11368
aS" But upon reflection I shouldn't have to sell this set - it should be able to sell itself! As I said before, I'm a huge fan of dark, mysterious old temples so for that I have to give it some love"
p11369
aS' It reminds me of the big old Adventurers sets and the whiff of nostalgia is itself a powerful intoxicant'
p11370
aS" However, for the price Lego is selling it in Australia/ Europe/ Canada I couldn't recommend it as a must-buy for full price when the smaller sets in this series are themselves so good"

p11373
aS" Note the backs of the crystal head have a plume-sized hole - or maybe that's just where they injected the blue brain-plastic"
p11374
aS" Spooky! I love these skulls, I wasn't sold from the initial pics but they have a very creepy smile and the head shape is just    weird  With the large eyes, it's kind of Homer Simpson-esque"
p11375
aS' They reminded me more of the movie "Coneheads", but I think your description is more accurate  Looking forward to the rest of the review!'
p11376
aS' The figs look great! The natives and the skeleton conquistador are my favorite figures in the set  The set itself is very good'
p11377
aS' The interior sort of reminds me of an older style lego set for some reason  It could be just me, but it has a classic feel  This will a great set to add to my list! Great review! (So far, anyway'

p11401
aS' I have to say that, on the one hand, I agree that the minifigures, the crystal skulls, and the colors are great (I even like the waterfall), but, on the other, I kind of think that the set itself is a disappointment'
p11402
aS" It looks like they tried to accommodate design and playability needs, but really didn't come through on either"
p11403
aS" So, as you pointed out, the mid section doesn't really fit in with the other parts, and the trap sequence doesn't really flow, either  But, perhaps your right, and all will be answered in the film"

aS' I was surprised at just how empty the temple looked in the photo taken from above'

p11460
aS' If you watch the teaser, there are some very similair stone pillars surrounded by sand (there are 4 not 2 though ) and when they close up it looks like all our characters are sucked into the sand and magically appear underground going through some stone plates(which act like steps to go down) that dissapear'
p11461

aS' Meh    3) Minifigs The only thing that has not really been discussed about the figs that you get in this set is that Marion has a slightly new torso'

p11492
aS' A DARK GREEN alligator, a net piece that I Know has appeared in sets before hand ( I needed it for a MOC I am working on), some raft part that is probably very old, a ladder with two pairs of hindges, and a DARK brown version of this part'
p11493
aS' 4) Build (amphibious vehicle) This I one of the more enjoyable builds of the new line  But that is just my opinion  You start of with some thing very simple  '
p11494

aS' 4b) Build (Front attachment) I am running out of things to say    Bulk it up    Add some detail    Add a gun and headlights    And attach to the rest to get the completed vehicle    Add stickers  '
p11496
aS' I honestly think that the amphibious vehicle looks much better with the stickers than without    5) Build (boat) This build goes by rather quickly and adds to the playability of the final set  Base  '

aS': 6395 Name: Victory Lap Racetrack Number of minifigs: 13 (!!) Number of pieces: unknown Release Year: 1988 Starting with the beautiful old Legoland box: Front: Back, with some cool alternative models: Inside: We continue with the great minifigs, which are not less than 13! I don\'t think there is any city set with more figures, is there? Civilians: Race Crew & Assistant Personnel: Drivers: All: Here\'s a overview of the whole set: The "Rescue Rig" (don\'t exactly know how to call it) with trailer: The score board & Traffic Lights, which would be one of the details i love the most about this set: The next sweet detail, the Camera + Cameraman! Of course we have a doc, if there is some kind of accident: The pit stop boxes, i love the small tool-holder with the axle and wheel behind it: The control room high above the racetrack: Ready to go?!! That was it all in all,all i can say is, if you see this set anywhere on ebay ore somewhere else, get it!'

aS' Thanks for this review! You have reviewed my most favourite town set of all times, I am so happy to own this one'
p11570
aS' I actually is a story to go along with it: In the summer of 1998 I went on holiday with my parents to the country of Luxembourg, in the city of Wiltz we encountered a small toystore which still had this set for sale, (9 years after the release!)'
p11571

p11617
aS' just imagine on!'
p11618
aS" Hello all, I don't believe there has been a review of this set yet, so I wanted to take this opportunity"
p11619
aS' Up for review today is 8160 Cruncher Block and Racer X as part of Batbrick and iamded reviews: Here is the box, I have to say I love the art on it'
p11620
aS" It's very colourful and makes the truck look a lot less crap than it does on the box"
p11621
aS' Plus, you have to love the "Missile launching action" bit right, am I right? Why are you all staring at me? And here is the back  Pretty generic, but shows some nice details and so forth'
p11622
aS' Oh dear! In turning around the box have I killed myself AND iamded!? Okey dokey, up first is the best part of the entire set: the minifigs! Racer X is wonderful, though coming with a boring Bruce Wayne face'
p11623
aS' But it is Cruncher Block, his lady Driver Taejo that really shine'
p11624
aS" Look at those awesome suits! The cool faces! Taejo has a ripped shirt! Now up is the first building part of the set, with me and iamded looking rather slick in X's car"
p11625
aS" While I'm not a big fan of yellow, it is very nice, and slopes in an underused colour is better than no slopes at all: Front view, the new windshields are fantastic: While a very cool car, it is rather silly of TLC to give us the exact same one we got in the smaller set"
p11626
aS" I didn't get the smaller set with this car, so I'm still happy, but it is a bad marketing move: Sorry iamded, I know it's your birthday, but     "
p11627
aS'VROOM! Now for the second part of the build and my favourite, the front of the truck: Annoyingly enough, this part opens up to shoot a pointless rubber projectile: To do this, you open the roof (a nice detail btw) and pull back the mechanism, here: Thus blowing the front part open and launching it'
p11628
aS'    well, not far really The wheels and covers are pretty cool, and the front is nicely designed, the red looks good and the rear vision mirrors are a great touch'
p11629
aS' And now for the most disappointing part - step three, the trailer: (Note - Clicky joint piece not part of set, just used to hold it up!) That\'s right, almost the entire thing is open, even the "filled in" side has holes! I\'d certainly be cared to be back there, one bumpy hill and back you go! I didn\'t put the lame computer stickers on, and the control area is pretty lame in general'
p11630
aS" Not to mention Taejo (who is depicted on the boxart as standing at the desk, would most likely just be sucked out the back at those speeds! There are some pluses too though, like the ridiculously awesome minifig paintings I'll be using for Wayne Manor"
p11631
aS' Also note the "control" on Cruncher\'s desk that when turned, turns the gun at the bottom  It\'s an alright feature: Here is an example, I\'ve shot iamded on his birthday'
p11632
aS" What? It's a love ray! Haven't you seen the Care Bears? And though I'm not a massive fan of stickers, this is just too cool"
p11633
aS' The little aquarium is very simple but very clever, using a printed piece between two clear windows to create the illusion of a tank: It looks much better in real life, trust me, and here is a side view to better explain: Now, to connect the two is a good thing, I like the way a simple technic piece assumes the job'
p11634
aS" Oh, and behold my hand! The completed truck, which, while a mixed bag, still doesn't look too bad (I guess): Now the completed set, which, despite its unbelievable large flaws, still looks cool"
p11635
aS' (Warning, the kickass iamded and Batbrick figures do not come with this set): More pics here: http://www brickshel   y'
p11636
aS'cgi?i=3147324 All in all: Minifigs: 5/5 - Racer X is beautiful, Cruncher Block and the Driver too, and Taejo has a ripped shirt, damn! Design: 2/5 - Pretty poor considering the best part is available in a cheaper set, and only the front part of the truck looks cool, but still not truly awful'
p11637
aS" Build: 3/5 - Despite having a bad trailer, it was a fun build and sometimes you need something that doesn't take ages to make"
p11638
aS' Price: 2/5 - Overpriced easily, but Rogue Shadow is worse! Fun: 3/5 - The mere concept of such an open truck kept me playing with this baby for hours! Total: 15/25, not as bad as it would seem'
p11639
aS" Overall I'm really glad I bought it as the minifigs are fantastic and the paintings and fish tank are cool"
p11640
aS" It's fun, stupid and downright ridiculous, but while not a great set by any means, certainly isn't as bad in the brick as it looks in photos"

p11642
aS" Awesome review Batbrick! I don't see any appeal at all really in this set, but that's okay, as I want to stick to Castle anyway"
p11643
aS' The car is the best part IMO, which you can get in a different set with another cool car and for a cheaper price'
p11644
aS" But the main downfall to this set is the fact that the truck's trailer is half blown up and the survivors are magically staying inside and not being sucked right out of there, as you have mentioned"
p11645
aS' I would have thought TLC would at least included some sort of cover that you could take on and off easily (kind of like the modular buildings)'
p11646
aS' Having said all that though, the front of the truck does look incredibly cool, and those minifigs are sweet  Too bad they all have flesh tone printed on them'
p11647
aS" So, while this may not be my set of choice, I can see the appeal    well, really I can't, but it's just my opinion! I'm sure there are plenty others who would love to scoop this set up  ~Peace"

p11659
aS" After having seen the movie, I now understand why; Cruncher's driver is a fairly manly looking woman, and most of the LEGO hairpeices would make the minifig look too girly for the character"
p11660
aS" :) Now that I know why Taejo's shirt is ripped up I don't mind the bits of fleshie color that are printed on it, but I do wish they would make some of the new torsos a little more head-colour agnostic"

p11666
aS" In the movie, the only time we see Cruncher's semi is when he's being chased by Racer X"
p11667
aS" Racer X and Taejo do end up on the same team for a cross country rally race (along with Speed of course), so I guess that's where they were going by putting those two together in the smaller set, but it would have been much more interesting for them to have made up a set with Taejo and one of the cars from the very goofy, comic book-gimmicky teams they are racing against"
p11668
aS" Especially since one of the teams (that is chasing Taejo specifically) is a bunch of Army-wannabee looniesI'm sure more people would have loved some sort of dark/sand green racer with one of the IJ Soviets at the wheel than another Racer X"
p11669
aS" To summarize: Two Racer X's is bad, but it is the smaller set that should have been changed (imho)"

p11671
aS"well, not far really As much as I normally don't like the stupid techic launcher thing, and would rather not see it in a set ever again (although one of these days I will make a giant multi-launcer rig out of them just for fun), at least there is a reason for it to be in this set, as Cruncher's semi has a missile launcher in the front end of it in the movie"
p11672
aS" I think you're supposed to lift the panel that hides the missile before launching it, similar to the way that panels slide out of the way on the semi cab to allow for firing in the movie"

I\'d certainly be cared to be back there, one bumpy hill and back you go I\'m gonna chock this up to the standard LEGO philosophy of "playset" rather than "model" design for a lot of things'
p11674
aS" The semi rig and Raver X's car are the models, the trailer is the playset"
p11675
aS' Seeing as how the trailer is Cruncher\'s mobile office (rather finely appointed with lots of paintings and his pirahna "babies" in their tank behind his desk), and the intent seems more or less to have a playest bit in order for kids to re-enact the scene from the movie, I\'m not going to give them too much grief over this'
p11676
aS' They tried to capture the basic bits of the movie set (which we see mostly from the inside during the movie) and translate it into a playset type environment'
p11677
aS' That being said, I do wish the back walls were more solid, as I see no reason for there to be gaps in the back wall when the front wall (or the "fourth wall" as the case may be here) is already conspicously absent'

p11687
aS' :) I still think that Racer X should be exclusive to this set and a different car should be in the smaller set with Taejo, which would have improved the cachet for this set overall'

aS' Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Price: 2/5 - Overpriced easily, but Rogue Shadow is worse! True  '
p11689
aS"this should have ideally been about a $30 set (especially given the general awesomeness of the IJ Race for the Stolen Treasure set), unless they made the trailer a bit more detailed (better back wall, perhaps some drop down gun ports like in the movie) or at put least one (or more) of Cruncher's goons in the set, then maybe I could agree more with the msrp"
p11690
aS' On that note: if I remember correctly from my visit to my local TRU yesterday in search of the new IJ sets (since local Targets seem determined not to get them in stock yet), they had this set on sale for around $35 along with an offer for a coupon good for $7'
p11691
aS'50 towards the purchase of a ticket to the movie with any Speed Racer toy purchase over $25  I may be wrong on the sale price, but I know the ticket offer was there'

aS' General Grievous Reviewed by Dunamis Set 10186 1,085 Pieces $89 95 from LEGO Shop @ Home Build time 3'
p11843
aS'5 hours It is the start of summer here in California and along with the weekly deluge of new action films we start to see some of the next wave of Star Wars LEGO sets'
p11844
aS' The latest offering from our favorite building toy company is none other than the infamous General Grievous! No doubt you all know the story of Grievous; two parts Technic and one part human and his hatred of the Jedi'
p11845
aS' Follow along as we get a close-up view of the mighty General  No doubt the observant will wonder why I purchased this set from Shop @ Home instead of my trusty LEGO store in Glendale'
p11846
aS' Well, its really as simple as two things: Ive been traveling a lot and didnt have time to drive to the store to get it AND gas is now $4/gallon and I would likely spend more in gas than the $9 shipping cost to get it to me'
p11847
aS' So there you have it  The Box: A gigantic box (much larger than expected) held the mighty General'
p11848
aS' Were back to the perforated tabs on the side and two stickers on the front that let the box lift open: Inside, we have 17 bags, two manuals and three stickers on a relatively small sticker sheet'
p11849
aS' The Manuals: The manuals are not terribly thick in fact the second manual is noticeably thinner than the first  They come in at 75 and 31pages'
p11850
aS' Interesting to note on the back we see the next (and more interesting) wave of sets later this summer'
p11851
aS' Nothing new to report on the manuals as they provide the LEGO standard of high quality and features we expect'
p11852
aS' - Piece callouts - Models divided into sections - Large images - Page numbers Since there were links posted to the '
p11853
aS'pdf files of the instructions online, Im sure you can all get an idea of the manual and the parts inventory'
p11854
aS' However, for those of you without access to the Internet here are photos of the parts inventory pages: Random manual image: Features page: The Pieces: The short answer is you get lots and lots of little pieces in white, gray and black plus some big pieces in white, gray and black'
p11855
aS' Mixed in the set is a fair amount of oddball pieces like minifig tools, Jedi hood and trans yellow dome'
p11856
aS' Fear not, despite the eclectic collection of parts, it all comes together in the end (not unlike a typical day at work for me) It is probably worth noting again that there is a heavy amount of Technic parts and pieces here'
p11857
aS' The Build: The build starts off with a rather in-depth build of the stand in which General Grievous stands on  Once you think you are done, you keep adding on to this (rather solid) base'
p11858
aS' I bet there are 250 pieces just in the base alone! It is quite nice when you get done with it though and really adds to the display  Im glad LEGO didnt skimp on the base as it completes the model'
p11859
aS' Once you get through all that, the rest of the build is a real thumb-bruiser  Anyone who has built a decent size Technic set knows the feeling of your thumbs being sore when you are done'
p11860
aS' You get the same effect here  It is actually a fun build and I really liked seeing how the designers used all the various pieces to recreate a fairly accurate model of Grievous'
p11861
aS' The model is built from the ground up as seen in a few of the progress shots: Here is what is left over: The Design: The design is quite good and is very accurate'
p11862
aS' Some might be disappointed that since this is a Technic set we dont have more articulation in the shoulders and have the ability to separate two arms into four as seen in the movie'
p11863
aS' However, it would seem the real intent is for display and not functionality'
p11864
aS' Here is a shot of the torso and the detail involved: Here are Grievous organs: Careful observers will note that my model is lacking two arrow stickers from the two white chest pieces'
p11865
aS' I failed to see these on the sticker sheet and only grabbed the large Grievous sticker  So, note that there are actually THREE stickers and not ONE'
p11866
aS' Chest protector and respirator: Head and arms: I was a little disappointed that we got two yellow blades and no green blades on the lightsabers'
p11867
aS' Note how all the lightsabers have different hilts which is a nice touch: Here are some shots of the completed model with a few other sets shown for scale'
p11868
aS' He is actually pretty tall: You have the option to remove the top two arms and put in shoulder plates if you so desire: Detail on the back: Overall Thoughts: Ive been saying for a few years that we should have a Technic Grievous set and we finally got one'
p11869
aS' Designed more as a model and not a fully functional swooshable figure, Grievous is a tad flimsy  You wont want him to veer too far off his massive and sturdy base'
p11870
aS' It would have been nice to have is cape with him (like the Technic Vader set)  I do like the size of the model and it is impressive to look at'
p11871
aS' LEGO Star Wars System fans will likely want to think twice before purchasing but Technic and UCS fans should be satisfied  Final Rating: 75% Build 8/10 (Very Good  Fun, relatively quick build'
p11872
aS' Technic fans will be more pleased than others ) Design 8/10 (Very Good  Some nice SNOT and Technic techniques  A bit flimsy but the base is kind of cool ) Parts 7/10 (A mixed bag of stuff'
p11873
aS' Probably cant get too many diverse builds from this except for other robot type models ) Price 7/10 (Just OK  A bit stiff at $90 USD for a nice display model with limited functionality'
p11874
aS') As always, lets hear your thoughts and feedback '
p11875
aS' Thanks so much dunamis for your awesome review '
p11876
aS' Yeah I think TLC miss the cape, it would be cool to own one but when we were talking of the 2008 sets around july of last year I can remember someone said it would come with cape'
p11877
aS' Finally is a little dissapoint TLC miss it   Edited by darkrebellion, 16 May 2008 - 07:20 PM '
p11878
aS' Excellent review, Dunamis  This set looks great  The designers really though the kit out, it seems  The internal organs have got to be my favorite part, but everything is good'
p11879
aS' Now all we need is a UCS Obi-Wan with a laser pistol to finish off Grievous in a totally anti-climatic way!'
p11880
aS'Hey Dunamis, think you can get a straight-on shot of the face? The red pieces inside the eye sockets are topped with trans-greenish-yellow studs which make his face look eerily alive and very close to his screen appearance'

aS" That transforming features a nice addition for sure, and these new flicker missile with its launch apparatus     hmm, I hope I wont spend quite some time in search of that little 'rocket' piece   "

aS' However, theres still something I miss with these alien crafts     I dont know     I like some more organic looking design, and they even come in some nice and different shapes, but still   '

aS' perhaps a real space fighter just needs a solid cockpit, cool windscreens and controls to satisfy my odd likings'
p12020
aS" That 'exo suit' looks really good and I wonder why its a little underrepresented on the box art"

aS' The jet pack/space scooters a really good idea, and the only thing I hatere those darned studless technic beams     it could look so much better with a studded version of these parts'

aS"Hi y'all! Guess what happened today? When walked into my Toys 'R' Us in Fullerton, CA, just to buy a simple Tiny Turbo racer, what do I see? All the Agents sets sitting on the shelf, ready for the taking! I didn't have too much money with me, so I just got 2 of 8631 Mission 1: Jetpack Pursuit! It's a really cool little set, so I thought I'd review this puppy for you! I shall proceed in the order of the instructions"
p12072
aS' So, let\'s get started! The Minifigs Let\'s begin with the minifigs, Saw Fist and Agent Chase! They are really cool, some of the coolest minifigs I have seen in a while! I took off Saw Fist\'s wig & chainsaw so you can see his head and cybernetic arm better! Here is a back view of Saw Fist, and - SURPRISE! Agent Chase has a double sided head! One side with his cool "mission face" with sunglasses and headset, and one with his casual Bruce Wayne type face (note, though, that it is not really the Bruce Wayne face)'
p12073
aS" His wig, btw, is Mutt's hairpiece in black! Very neat! Poor Saw Fist seems to be forced to always drag his chainsaw around for it is way too long to just hang down from his shoulder like a normal arm"
p12074
aS" The Snowmobile Next up, we have the snowmobile, a sleek little vehicle with only minor design flaws! The container with the jewel is attached to the vehicle by a single stud, so it doesn't fall off, but is easy to pick up! In the pic below you can see the only two tiny design flaws: Thanks to the exhaust pipes, the laser cannon (or whatever it's supposed to be) can't be lowered any further than this"
p12075
aS' Also, the corners of that slope-ish piece that the handle bar rests on are sticking out a little at the sides'
p12076
aS" Other than that, it's pretty well done! The Jetpack Finally, there is the Jetpack! IMO, a name like Autogyro-pack or something would make more sense, but whatever"
p12077
aS' Although a little bulky, the Jetpack is very well designed! The rotor can be tilted back, and at the lower back of the Jetpack, there is hook with which you can grab the container with the jewel from the snowmobile'
p12078
aS" What I like best about the Jetpack is that although it is attached to the minifig in kinda the same way as that of the Riddler, this one doesn't rotate around"
p12079
aS' So, the Agent is being held in place steadily! "See ya later, chainsaw-cyborg-dude!" Stickers This set comes with a surprisingly large sticker sheet'
p12080
aS' The reason is that half of it are extra stickers! There are two large Agents logos and one Inferno logo - perfect for Agents MOCs! There are also a star and a small, round sticker portraying the number of the mission'
p12081
aS' The star seems to be part of some kind of game where you collect the stars from all sets on an Agents ID that you get from the Mission 5 set'
p12082
aS" I don't know, though, if you get any gain from this except for becoming a full-status Lego Agent! Below, you can find the list of parts from this set! Click here for a better quality pic! That's pretty much it! I hope you liked this review and will run straight to your next toy store to get one or more of this set! This was my very first set review! So any questions, comments, or requests? Any more pics you want me to take? Would you like me to exchange the chainsaw with something else, or do you want me to try the Agent's new hairpiece out on another fig? If so, just tell me! See ya! Edited by Oky Wan Kenobi, 25 June 2009 - 08:21 PM"
p12083
aS" Thanks for the excellent review Oky! Judging by this set, the line is going to be promising  I really like the figs and I'm glad to see that robot arm is actually a new arm mold"
p12084
aS" Awesome!! Can a minifig hand fit in the end or just the chainsaw attachment? Could it fit an Exo-Force robot claw? There's a lot of detail in the torsos and I like that the Agent's suit is like a moto-cross uniform"
p12085
aS' I love that the snowmobile has a working tread  Copmike, Ras and I tried to build a snowmobile with working treads, but we ended up using chainsaw blades in the end  Great work Oky!'
p12086
aS" That's a great review for your first one  I think the jet pack if far to bulky it could do with some minimising but thats life"
p12087
aS' I assume that you cant fit a standard hand in the chainsaw arms are the hole would be to large but would you be so good as to confirm this for me? Overall I quite like the jet ski and the ability to lower the arms to much doesnt both me'
p12088
aS' How much was it just so I can get an idea of the price? Finally thanks for posting this review so quickly '
p12089
aS' This is MUCH MUCH MUCH more promising than the 2008 Batman set for $10 00  The vehicle looks like someone took time to design it, but the Batman one looks like '
p12090
aS' Lego dear Lego, where is the quality for Batman??!?! I really like the new cyborg arm, and the propellers on that thing : ), it is a really promising line although I would get rid of all those bionicle pieces'
p12091
aS"Thanks for the great review Oky Wan The two vehicles look quite nice for a small set and the minifigs look great! The two sided head is nice, although it would've been nice if it was a new head rather than the standard frowning face"
p12092
aS' The cyborg looks good, nice and cartoony, I like the printing on his back  The belt on the hips should be useful, not to mention the robotic hand'
p12093
aS' I assume that anything that fits into a 1x1x1 cylinder can fit in it? I hope so Thanks again Oky  Any chance you can get any more sets?'

p12108

aS" I got and put together this set yesterday, and since then I've so fallen in love with it that I've just got to review it"
p12200
aS' The main components of the set are the jet, the truck and trailer, and the three Minifigs; Gold Tooth, an Inferno Henchman, and Agent Fuse'
p12201
aS' Fuse is your basic jet pilot-looking guy, but he does come with one of those handy double-printed faces with smiley look an a scared look'
p12202
aS' The Henchman is your basic LEGO criminal with an Inferno uniform, and Gold Tooth is the perfect example of a super-villain with his gold hair, gold teeth, gold piercings, and golden gun (Auric Goldfinger meets Saramanga?) The Inferno Jeep is a nice, quick build with cool rubberized shocks and a slick, almost futuristic design'
p12203
aS' The black and orange colors work really well together and the swiveling back seat for the Henchman and his huge pistols is a nice touch'
p12204
aS" The fact that the trailer hauling the gold bricks and target gimmick is a separate piece instead of a bed assembly on the jeep is great because it allows the Jeep to stand on it's own without the cargo or gimmick"
p12205
aS" The best part of the set, however, is the Agents jet  It's small and uncomplicated, but it's very cool and very satisfying"
p12206
aS' The large cockpit on the smaller body is sort of reminiscent of old GI Joe jet toys  The air intakes on the bottom are made with the ever-popular SNOT building technique which is sure to please many'
p12207
aS" But just the sheer swooshability of the jet and it's compact sweetness is reason enough to get this set"
p12208
aS" Heck, I'm already considering getting a few more and swapping the dark blue on the jet out for other colors so I can have a small, multi-colored fleet of the things"
p12209
aS' The abundant stickers might turn some people off, but the level of detail they add to the jet is worth the hassle'
p12210
aS' Man, I really wish LEGO would do more modern-style military-type vehicles like this, because it is full of win'
p12211

I love Gold Toth, the perfect campy Roger Moore bond villain, as you said, a cross between The Man with the Golden Gun and the Man with the golden touch himself! I love that jet too, simply fantastic, I can't believe we actually thought this line would be bad"

p12285
aS' These MF characters look really charming too, although it would just be super comfortable to get the villain and his henchman in two slightly different dresses, perhaps'
p12286

p12290
aS" Thanks for the sweet review, Deino! This looks like a neat set, though I must say one of the first things that struck me was the henchman stole Gold Tooth's gold tooth  Well, one of them anyway"
p12291
aS" Anyway, that gold hair piece is sweet, as is the fire hose end gun, I wasn't expecting that! The Agent's reversible head is another great bonus, The jeep is fantastic, I love orange! The Jet's nice too, but I really love the Jeep! Is there anything under the hood of the jeep? It looks openable, but it may be like that just for the sloped look"

p12331
aS' Warning: There is a SHITLOAD of pictures! And here we go! Set Nr : 7737 Name: Coast Guard 4WD Number of minifigs: 1 Number of pieces: unknown Release Year: 2008 First of all (surprise surprise '
p12332

I really like these new cars, cause they are much more real looking, except maybe of the missing doors, but that can be fixed with a little bit mocing in this case'
p12333
aS" If you see it, buy it  You won't be disappointed  That's all i can say! We go on with the Coast Guard Truck, which is my absolutely Nr  1 of the new sets"
p12334
aS' Let the Pictures speak for themselves! Set Nr'
p12335
aS': 7726 Name: Coast Guard Truck & Speedboat Number of minifigs: 2 Number of pieces: unknown Release Year: 2008 As could it be something different, first of all the box & instructions again: Front: Back: We got 2 sets of instructions here, first one for the Boat & equipment thingy, second one for the rest: The minifigs: General overview: The truck & equipment thing alone: A different view of the truck: The first detail i really like at that set, the thing that holds the diving and kinda radar-equipment: The trailer with the boat on it: The trailer alone: '
p12336
aS' and the boat alone: Now that is something i think could have been made better, or say, put at least SOMETHING in it, the storage room in the stern of the boat'
p12337
aS" Though it's got plenty of room and you can put in anything you like: The next detail i love are the motors of the boat, the're really well-designed and you can even move them sideways or pull 'em up if they're not needed: The wench on the trailer to pull the boat on it or load it off to the water: And last but not least, the cockpit of the truck, nothing too special but i really like that the did put the black slope brick screen in it: That was it folks, quite a few pictures, huh? Summary: Just one word: BUY"
p12338
aS" As i said this is my favourite of the new sets, and if i was i child i think i could play hours and hours with it, as it's got great plaability and isn't really fragile or something"

aS' Hope you enjoyed the Review, LEGO City & Coast Guard on!'

aS' Coming in at around $50 US, Turbo Car Chase is one of the bigger of the new Agents sets  A big box with a helicopter, car, and gate in it'
p12673
aS" Seems like a winner, but how good is it really, and is it worth the cash? Let's start with the Minifigs  This set comes with a standard Inferno Henchman, Spy Clops, and Agent Chase"
p12674
aS' The Henchman is you basic LEGO criminal type with a gun and a jumpsuit, nothing real groundbreaking here  Spy Clops, on the other hand, is very cool for, technically, half of a Minifig'
p12675
aS' His head has a neat electronic goggle print and the rest of him is a torso mounted onto a set of six legs made from Exo-Force robot arms  The whole thing is really well done and neat as hell'
p12676
aS' Agent Chase (Turbo Car Chase! ) seems to have a standard agent body and a double-printed face with one side a sunglasses and headset print  The other face is a determined Agent look'
p12677
aS' The set also includes a laptop with Doctor Inferno wallpaper  The laptop is a new piece and works like the LEGO books that are in a lot of Harry Potter sets'
p12678
aS' Molding on the keyboard is really well done and the thing can be held by a Minifig along either corner, but not in the middle and not while closed'
p12679
aS' The gate in the set is nothing revolutionary by itself, and I sort of get the feeling that it was included to drive up the piece count and the set price point'
p12680
aS' That being said, there are some things to like here  For instance, the gate has four wheels of barbed wire attached to it'
p12681
aS' The barbed wire is new and makes me want to start building some World War I trench MOCs'
p12682
aS' The rest of the gate is fairly big and it has a handy ramp attached so that vehicles can roll through it easily  The main feature of the gate is a sound brick'
p12683
aS" It's much better then LEGO sound and light units of the past, when the gate is opened it depresses a button and an alert klaxon blares that sounds every bit like a prison-beak in progress"
p12684
aS" The triggering action works surprisingly well and it's pretty much for this feature alone that I'm not going to immediately break the gate back down and add it to my parts bin"
p12685
aS' The designers did make an effort to create more then just a fence though  A nice control panel connected to a big spotlight crowns the piece, and a pair of cameras watch the opening'
p12686
aS" It's really hard to mess up a LEGO helicopter, and this set is no exception  The Inferno Chopper is a nicely proportioned and well built machine"
p12687
aS' It looks properly menacing and has the uniform orange and black of other Inferno property'
p12688
aS" It's armed with a set of four Technic pegs cleverly used as guns on outriding mounts, as well as a pair of the newer-style flick-fire missiles"
p12689
aS" I personally don't care for flick-firing missiles, but these look decent enough and seem to stay put so I really can't complain about them"
p12690
aS" Along the fuselage are a pair of intake pieces that I've never seen before and I'm guessing are new  They're pretty well designed and will come in handy for MOCing down the road"
p12691
aS' The action feature of the aircraft is the wench system  This is very different then other LEGO wenches in that you build the entire mechanism and housing'
p12692
aS' You can then use it to raise Spy Clops up and down from the bottom of the chopper using the rotor'
p12693
aS' Now, this also keeps you from sitting there and just giving the rotor repeated spins to simulate flight'
p12694
aS" I'm not too thrilled with that, but there are a hundred other LEGO helicopters out there with fully rotating rotors, so I guess I can let it by just this once"
p12695
aS" As you'd suspect, the bottom of the cockpit is completely open, which makes this a vehicle pretty much solely for Spy Clops (Sorry Henchman)"
p12696
aS' But there is plenty of room beneath the body to attach a plate with some seats on it to accommodate another pilot without drastically altering the design, or even removing existing pieces'
p12697
aS' The Turbo Car is a slick little honey of a LEGO car, and the silver pieces that make up the body work contribute a lot to that fact  The front license plate appears to be an Exo-Fore code brick'
p12698
aS" But it also hides the activation lever for the passenger ejector seat  The seat works about as well as the Spruce Goose, which is to say not well at all, but here it's the thought that counts"
p12699
aS" The interior of the car is really well done  There's even a radar screen for keeping track of pesky helicopters  But the Bond-like features don't end there"
p12700
aS' A lever in the compartment raises pair of guns in the hood and a knob on the rear deploys a quad rocket system with more flick-fire missiles'
p12701
aS" This is a car that won't be stopped easily! The rear has two cones sticking out  I'd like to think they're smoke nozzles or oil-slick sprayers  All-in-all, this is a really good set"
p12702
aS" The car is pure LEGO vehicle love and looks fantastic  The silver pieces are very nice and it's a shame LEGO doesn't use metallic colors in System sets more often"
p12703
aS" There are, however, a LOT of sticker for this set and I know how much that bugs a lot of people  I personally like how much detail the stickers add to these sets and don't mind them so much"
p12704
aS' The set also comes with an Agents ID card for Chase which you can put little star stickers on from other sets as you get them'
p12705
aS" It's printed on a real nice piece of sturdy plastiboard and would be cooler if you could put your own picture and name on it instead of pretending to be Chase"
p12706
aS" Sold by themselves, the car and chopper would be must-haves  All tossed together with the gate sort of makes the set a little less then the sum of it's parts"
p12707
aS" And with 498 parts (most of them small) that's not so hot  It's only slightly over-priced in my opinion, but if you do shell out the money you won't regret it"
p12708
aS" I'm very comfortable recommending this set to anyone  Close to perfect, but the price and some minor flaws bring it back just a little  I'd say 4 33, but out of 5 is close enough!"

aS" And I didn't even see it had a sound brick until I read this last night  Usually LEGO promotes stuff like that pretty loudly on the packaging  Not here though "
p12746
aS"WOW! Thanks, Deino, for this great review! I can't wait to get this myself, but right now I gotta save for the CW sets! The car is with no doubt one of the most mind blowing things TLG has come up with and we can only hope that there will be more models made out of almost only metalic colors! The spider cyborg, while not as innovative as some of the other cyborgs, is a very nice fig, and his head will be very usefull for Splinter Cell MOCs! And those intake pieces are only relatively new btw, they are in almost all of the current $10 Racers sets"

aS' Hello all Eurobricks members, I will present to you a very short review on the recent Castle Battlepacks'
p12814
aS' This time, I will be reviewing Skeleton Battlepack, and I hope everyone of you do enjoy viewing it  This was a request that put up by hollisbrick in the Castle thread'
p12815
aS' Initally, I thought it was a very simple set to do a review  However, for the love of Castle, I decided to whip this up for every Castle fan out there'
p12816
aS' This is an image of how the Skeleton Battlepacks look like  I have bought 12 last packs of these in total so far but none of the Crown battlepacks yet  There were snapped much faster, that I imagined'
p12817
aS" Do pardon me for the poor lightning  Today is a bad weather, it's hard to get natural light  The Skeleton Gang For a single battlepack like this, with an attractive reasonable price"
p12818
aS' You obtained a series of 5 skeleton mini-figs with tons and tons of useful castle accessories'
p12819
aS" To me, it's a very very great buy, and it's a MUST to stock up for my army building! Some add-ons! However, I was not very satisfied with my Skeleton armies standards"
p12820
aS' Therefore, I decided to make some slight modifications with some additional castle accessories that is stocked in my Castle warehouse'
p12821
aS' After the makeover, Ok, this is what I called a real skeleton army  This is mainly my opnion and it have to be aligned with my standards'
p12822
aS' I felt this improved battlepack gives a punch to the exisitng battlepack  The two soliders on the right, is able to align with the rest of my Castle Chess sets armies'
p12823
aS' While the one on the left, it gives me a great archer back up with the quiver and helmet attached to him'
p12824
aS' The ones, on the center especially the armored guard which equipped with the black nose cone helmet is my fave'
p12825
aS' It is able to illustrate the "Elite" among the rest of the guards with its armor and helmet which was featured in my Castle Deep Forest Expansion MOC '
p12826
aS' Promotion On! In addition, the one which was hastly done with a modify mace, it looks rather simple  In time to come, I will change it and gives a better equipment and look  These are the remains'
p12827
aS' I can use the axe for my dwarf in my dwarf mine defender  In that set, there is no weapon for my dwarf and I have to get it from other sets'
p12828
aS' The rest of the accessories, makes a very good stock up for future upgrading! Overall: 9/10 This is not a playset'
p12829
aS' It is mainly bought for its abilty to mass recurit any armies, and is a main love for all Castle Army builders such as me! This set mainly have no major faults, and I love it so much'
p12830
aS' Although, I have done some slight modifciations, but this set is a must for me to buy more and more! Meanwhile, I will need to wait for the next shipment! Hope everyone have enjoying viewing this simple review of mine! Edited by WhiteFang, 25 May 2008 - 12:52 PM'

aS'00 (CAD) *prices quoted from S@H I understand that 7009 and 7090 offers more pieces, horses and same amount of mini-figs compared to a typical battlepack'
p12899
aS' IMO, I feel that all 3 sets are all army building sets  7009 offer small catapult, 3 mini-figs, a skeleton white horse'
p12900
aS' 7090 offer a joust divider, weapon rack (good accessories), 2 mini-figs, a horse with barding and a skeleton black horse  These sets have different purpose'
p12901
aS' For me, buying multiples of 7009 is to build its catapult, white skeleton calvaries  While 7090 is to build on Crown calvaries and Black skeleton calvaries'
p12902
aS' However, Battlepacks have a different agenda  It offered some castle accessories that is not available commonly  For a Castle army builder like myself, castle accessories are always in demand'
p12903
aS' The black robe, silver armor, silver short-axe are not very common castle accessories  It can be used as a good stock up too'
p12904
aS" I am not saying this battlepack is an one way solution to solve everything  That's why, different sets are released to target on different purposes "
p12905
aS"WhiteFang, although I realize that the battle packs are great specifically for building armies, and castle accessories (which is why its such a shame that I won't be able to buy these things ), while sdpirate's sets are more for a catapult, Calvary whatever"
p12906
aS' The fact to the matter is with the battle pack you get: 5 minifigs with lots of accessories'
p12907
aS' While with the sets that sdpirate showed us you get: 5 minifigs with an okay amount of accessories 3 horses (including two skeleton ones) A ballista A weapons rack, and a jousting barricade'

aS' You cannot say that the battle pack contains the same amount of stuff that the other two sets have and therefore should be priced the same'

aS' It just seems that Lego is ripping off Canadian army builders, to me if the battle pack contained a small catapult, or wall so that it contained about the same amount of stuff that the other sets had it would be fair'
p12910
aS' It seems stupid that you will only get minifigs from one set, while you can get about the same amount of minifigs plus a bunch of other stuff from two other equally priced sets'

p12920
aS" We can't be sure why TLC placed their pricing strategies this way"
p12921
aS' Well, I think we should appericate what TLC is trying to do for us, by not using price as the only factor to judge whether to buy this set or not'
p12922
aS' At least, I am sure there are many of us trying to request for battlepacks to muster armies for their MOCs, Armies Collection and etc'
p12923

Rp13034
aS' Thanks for reviewing this rare set! Since it came out in 1999 I have only seen this set in a toystore one single time, one single copy as well  '
p13035
aS" It was in the summer of 1999 in Belgium (Arlon) in a store called 'Maxi Toys' (Belgiums TRu, I think)"
p13036
aS' They had the three biggest Junglesets for sale there: these Ancient Ruins, The set with the beautiful black boat and the zeppelin'
p13037
aS' Being into Adventurers at that time I had never seen the entire Jungle theme (not even in a leaflet or catalog) and surprised as I was I bought all three sets'
p13038
aS' That was one happy Dutch boy in Belgium! Surprisingly the two smallest sets made it in very small quantities to my local stores in Holland (except for the pontoon plane and small raft which was my very first Shop at Home order)'
p13039
aS" The spider's secret I bought off BL, which makes me the proud owner of the entire Jungle Serie"
p13040
aS" Back to the set: This was the first time in a long history of collecting Lego that I had a deformed piece: an 2x8 red plate was twisted, I twisted it back and it still serves it's purpose  "
p13041
aS' I loved the whole steam-idea in this Jungle serie: the two boats both (including the one in this set) had nice steamengines and a very cool mechanic (yours has the wrong hat/hair btw) to come along with them'
p13042
aS' The skeleton falling down on the end of a chain was the most intriguing part of this set for me, it worked really well and when you were done scaring minifigures you could winch it up again ready for the next go'
p13043
aS' The only thing I did not really like about this set was the difference in wheelsize on the car, front small, back large and the way the palmtree consisted out of just three parts  '
p13044
aS' All in all a great set that is becoming more rare and expensive as we speak/post  Get it! Edited by simonwillems, 26 May 2008 - 07:59 PM '
p13045
aS' Great review! I just barly missed the Jungle series, growing up with half a year of Jungle and mainly Orient Expedition and Dino Island'
p13046
aS" I like Egypt more, but this set (despite the 4x4 palm tree) is practically perfect  I love the detail and vibrant colours  Gotta say, I've got a thing for Pippin Reed myself"
p13047
aS' By the way, what does "VHTF" mean? Edited by sdpirate, 28 May 2008 - 01:06 AM '
p13048
aS' VHTF= Very Hard to Find  To answer some earlier replies    No, there are no stickers in this set'
p13049
aS' While some Adventurers sets of the era had stickers (the 5956 Zeppelin had tons), all of the interesting mesoamerican designs from this set are printed'
p13050
aS' Also, simonwillems was correct; my mechanic is missing his hat, which should be a black kepi'
p13051
aS" They're extremely expensive on BL, though (proving once again that this set has some awesome parts), so I ordered a replacement from Lego  It's in the mail and should come soon "
p13052
aS" The printed pieces are the real gems of this set  Beyond them, there isn't much to this set, though the boat hull is nice  The model itself, isn't all that great"
p13053
aS' The new Akator temple is definately a superior model (at least in piece count), but those printed pieces are hard to resist  Steve'

aS" The model itself, isn't all that great  The new Akator temple is definately a superior model (at least in piece count), but those printed pieces are hard to resist  Steve I have to agree"
p13056
aS" Too few pieces for such a high price- but amazing figs too, and a nice baseplate! Despite a 4+ palm tree, you get more palm tree leaves for MOC's  Plus, I think a monkey? And that sweet Achu figure "
p13057
aS' I absolutly love this set  This is in my opinion the best Adventurers set  It has it all; the falling bridge, the falling skeleton, the spear trap, and the classic trapdoor  It is a must-have set'

aS" I too thought the Joker's van was the pleasant surprise of this set  The Tumbler looks good yes, until you see it in person    it's grossly oversized"
p13442
aS' They should have made it closer to a regular car size (like the movie), because this one is a monster '
p13443
aS' I bought this off ebay, while not having been collecting space as a child, it was mainly Wild West and City  '
p13444
aS" I have decided, upon reading KDog's M:Tron Bar Brawl Mania strip in his Space Comic, to buy as many M:Tron sets and figures I could find "

p13446
aS" To start off with, here's a picture of the box: Here's a general shot showing the entire set: A front view: The buggy: Another shot of the buggy without the minifig: The flyer: The flyer without the Minifig: M:Tron crate with some equipment and hoses, I don't know the use of the hoses though : The cockpit open: The cockpit closed with the crew: The Magnetic crane: Another shot of the Crane: Rear View with Hatch open: One of the side slots that can carry either the Buggy or the Flyer: Top view of this excellent Vehicle: Excellent for getting Spyrius or Blacktron out of your way : Final shot: Excellent set, one of the biggest space ground vehicles and one of the best sets made by LEGO"

p13451
aS" I suppose it's a matter of personal opinion though "
p13452
aS' Great Review of a great set  I always figured the hoses were welding torches (attached to jetpacks, yeah!) as the whole thing had the vibe of a mobile repair center'
p13453
aS' Much like many of my favorite sets, this one has a base of simple bricks and plates and then from that solid foundation the rest is built out to be decorative or have the action features'
p13454
aS' This gives sets a very solid feel as demonstrated in this set, the first Snowspeeder, and Galaxy Explorer'
p13455
aS' The MM Armored Drilling Unit has a more technic base giving it a less solid appearance and though I like the set, that jet that luanches from the back is horrible, partially because of the useless orange containment things'
p13456
aS' The Mega Core has a nifty crane instead of a big useless jet  -Tohst'

p13458
aS' It is just so dense when you build it, full of nice surprises, no technique required, and a wonderful stearing mechanism that I rank as more important than the suspension of the mars version'
p13459
aS' This thing was meant to crush anyway, who needs suspension? I also like the way you never felt that the M-trons deserved a base after building this, it was that good    The colour scheme was perfect '

aS' Ive been enamored with the character since she first appeared in Batman: The Animated Series back in the 90s, and Ive since followed her misadventures through her introduction into the regular Batman series during No Mans Land, into her own series, and even on the short-lived and not-so-good Birds of Prey TV show'
p13627
aS' So please excuse any pro-Harley bias  So, down to business  The 267 piece set retails for $30 US ($35 at Toys R Us) and builds up very fast and easy'
p13628
aS' It consists of Batmans Bat Cycle, Harleys Hammer Truck, and brand new Batman and Harley Quinn Minifigs  There is also no lack of weapons'
p13629
aS' In addition to the usual bag of Bat-accessories and guns, the set also comes with a pair of gray revolvers'
p13630
aS' Batman in this set has the new armor torso print and the hips are the same color as the legs, hinting that this is supposed to represent the movie style Batsuits more so then the traditional comic book underwear over tights look'
p13631
aS' Harley Quinn is a very cool looking Minifig, and I havent grinned so much at a new Batman character figure since my first Batman Minifig a couple years ago'
p13632
aS' The figure is very true to the character, and the torso has been accented with a few shape lines to try and distinguish her as a female despite the boxy body'
p13633
aS' Harleys jester cap is an interesting new piece  It seems (to me at least) to be made of a slightly different grade of plastic then were used to'
p13634
aS' Its molded in red and painted with black and white, and it comes packed in its own separate little baggie  I expect that this piece may have cost LEGO a little more then usual to produce'
p13635
aS' Harley also has a buildable accessory, a giant mallet  Sure, she cant stand up all that well unless its held in specific ways, but its neat and most importantly, its funny'
p13636
aS' Its especially fun for smacking the everloving crap out of other Minifigs with  The Bat Cycle is in bag number one and is a very fast build'
p13637
aS' This isnt some little Japanese sport bike like Nightwings cycle  This monster is almost a car and seems to pack just the right amount of intimidation for the Caped Crusader to exploit'
p13638
aS' Thanks to the thick tires (two in front, one in back) it stands up just fine on its own and rolls very well  The huge exhaust pipes are a nice touch and give the thing a look of engine power'
p13639
aS' The only real flaw is the inclusion of the flick-fire missiles mounted on the sides  But, as with any LEGO model, they can be easily left out without hurting the look of the vehicle'
p13640
aS' The hammer truck is the bulk of this set and a lot more fun then it looks  Of the monster truck persuasion, the vehicle is designed and built with a surprising level of solidity'
p13641
aS' The axle mounts are particularly impressive  The big wheels and tires just beg you to drive this thing right over the Bat Cycle (or Batman)  The mega-mallet gimmick is also a surprise'
p13642
aS' Not so much for its technical complexity, there isnt any really, but for the fact that once you start turning the knob at the rear to swing the mallet back and forth, its really a lot of fun'
p13643
aS' There are some low points to the truck design  Again the flick-fire missiles are tacked on and theres a cargo crate/bed set into the back for Harleys loot of jewels'
p13644
aS' The crate would have looked a lot better molded in black  In brown it breaks up the look of the truck a little  Speaking of which, the look of the truck is very pleasing'
p13645
aS' The red and black Harley Quinn color scheme works really well on the vehicle  There are a few stickers here, and unfortunately, the diamond patterned ones are applied over multiple bricks'
p13646
aS' The rest, however, are great  Not only does she have an I Love Joker bumper sticker, but she has a Joker playing card taped to her dash, I guess serving as a picture of her beloved Puddin'
p13647
aS' There is also a sticker for activation of the hammer, which boldly shouts HIT ME! This is a fun set  A neat new Batman vehicle and a big truck with lots of playability'
p13648
aS' The Harley Minifig is a must-have for any Bat-Fan and, if you only get one of the Batman sets this year, Id recommend this one'
p13649
aS' The price versus piece-count on this set is a little bit of a deterrent though'
p13650
aS' This might not be the best set for collectors on a budget or people looking for something completely new and innovative, but anyone buying this for a child can rest assured that the kid will get your moneys worth out of the set through its play value'
p13651
aS' When added together and averaged out, the pros and cons of this set combine to give it a score of out of 5  Even if Harley herself is a clean 6 out of 5'

aS' Hi all, so I was at "The Wal-Mart" yesterday and had the munchies and was looking for something to eat'
p13809
aS' Somewhere along the line, I stopped caring about food and decided to browse the toy department to see what they had Lego-wise'
p13810
aS' Usually, they have jack squat, but on this particular day they had a lot of new sets'
p13811
aS" I impulsively picked this set up, along with Harley Quinn's Hammer Truck and the new little campsite from the Indy 4 line"
p13812
aS" I must say, when I first saw images of this set I wasn't exactly thrilled or anything"
p13813
aS" I mean, I didn't really see anything particularly special about it, but after purchasing it, I must admit that I would consider it a must buy for any Lego fan  But enough babbling about myself"
p13814
aS' Onward with the review (my first of an official set)! In this picture, you can see everything you get with the set  I thought the box-art was pretty nice looking'
p13815
aS' The manual, on the other hand, took somewhat of a beating within the box, a common problem with most more recent sets  I do have to say that I wish they would at least make some effort in fixing this'
p13816
aS' They could just make a little thin cardboard "folder" to minimize bending and tears  For Batman minifig collector\'s, the highlight of this set are the Robin and Penguin figs'
p13817
aS' Previously, you could only get them in the pricey Bat-Cave set, but this set provides a much cheaper alternative'
p13818
aS" One thing you will notice, however, is that Robin's hairpiece is a new mold, as it is actually a black version of Mutt's hair (from the Indy 4 line)"
p13819
aS' Personally, I think it actually looks better than the hairpiece used on the older version of Robin'
p13820
aS' As the Batcave had before it, this set comes with some bricks to make two cute (but deadly) penguins  They help add more charm to an already charming set'
p13821
aS' When you\'re finished building, you\'ll end up with a nice little assortment of extra parts; 1 black "cheese slope," 3 1x1 tile (black, yellow and white), a revolver, a technic pin, and a 1x1 red round plate'
p13822
aS" Here's Robin's Scuba Jet  It's nice and sleek looking  Notable parts of interest would probably be the green turbine engines"
p13823
aS' My only complaint on this one would have to be the use of decals on the 2x2 round yellow tiles  For that type of a part, printing seems as though it would have been the best way to go'
p13824
aS" Now for, in my opinion, the best part of the set   the Penguin's sub  This set has more decals than Robin's Scuba Jet, but they seem more necessary in this case"
p13825
aS" I actually wanted to put the decal's on the sub, as I think the it looks great with them"
p13826
aS' Obviously, it looks like a penguin, but wow, does it ever do it with style! It has a lot of interactive features, the first of which I will mention, being the periscope which raises up and down'
p13827
aS" And for the collectors of parts in new colors, it has a few parts in medium orange?, such as 2x2 tile  Here's a shot of the bottom of the sub"
p13828
aS' Another nifty little feature is how you can lift the top off and fit the penguin inside'
p13829
aS' And there is enough room inside, so that you can firmly place top on again, and without interference to the movement of the periscope  Another little feature is the rear spring-loaded missile'
p13830
aS' You just tilt the small lever toward the front of the sub, and it fires  And the last small feature are the flick-missiles on each side'
p13831
aS' Overall, this is a great set with a lot to offer for a decent price'
p13832
aS' A lot of fans might view the only drawback to it as being the use of decals, but if you plan on keeping the kit together they make it look really fantastic  Buy it if you can'

aS" Here's also some cute Agents-type artwork at the end of one of the books  Instructions show piece call-outs and are divided into sections according to numbered bags"
p13908
aS" As you'd expect for a set with 1100+ parts, this baby comes with a lot of bags  It's a treasure trove of dark blue"
p13909
aS' As well as the obvious large slopes and wall panels which make up the body and the roof, there is a wealth of smaller navy blue pieces as well - small 1x1 bricks, 2x2 bricks, 1x1 plates, 2x2 tiles, heaps of 2x plates, some slopes, 22x cheese pieces'
p13910
aS'   basically anyone wanting a lot of dark blue should think about this set  The roof panels alone, for example, could provide a dark blue sea for a modernised Pirate MOC'
p13911
aS" 2 DSSs (Dreaded Sticker Sheets)  Quelle surprise - stickers! The grey parts of the stickers here are metallic silver ink, which is a nice touch  Actually, as sticker sheets go, they're not too bad"
p13912
aS' Fairly subtle for the most part and the navy blue actually matches the bricks themselves  However, after looking at the sticker sheets I thought I was missing something'
p13913
aS" What about the pieces used for the projection screens showing Dr Inferno and the sharks - why weren't they on the sticker sheets? There must be another one! Frantically I checked and rechecked the box and flipped through all the instruction manuals to find the elusive 3rd sheet"
p13914
aS' Where was it? Ten minutes later I noticed something which had honestly never occured to me - THERE WERE ACTUAL PRINTED PIECES IN THIS SET! So obvious and yet so unthinkable'
p13915
aS" It's horrifying how years and years of Exoforce and Speed Racer set releases can mentally condition people's thought processes  Tut tut, Lego"
p13916
aS' What have you reduced us to? Here they are, folks - ACTUAL PRINTED PIECES  (Yes, I do believe this news deserves the caps'
p13917
aS") I also noticed this nifty modification of the usual 2x3 cupboard - you can now fit drawers in it! Very clever  This may have been around in Belville sets for years for all I know, but it's new to me"
p13918
aS' The drawers slide in and out very well and the top one sits on slight indentations in the middle of the cupboard  Part 2: The figs! Our trusty agents - Charge, Chase, Trace and Fuse'
p13919
aS" (High powered agents don't have time for names of more than one syllable - that's why the bad guys always lose )  Chase and Fuse have the Mutt hair in black and dark orange"
p13920
aS" The lovely Agent Trace has an exquisite new hairpiece in dark brown, perfect for 'Rapunzel' themed MOCs  As you can see, her ponytail is loooong  Makes it hard to sit down, the poor girl"
p13921
aS' I feel sorry for all these female figs with such intricate hairstyles that they can never relax in an ordinary Lego chair  However, at least she has two breasts unlike the recent Harley Quinn fig'
p13922
aS" Compensation indeed  Seriously though, it's great that there's a separate torso print for the female character and this attention to detail is typical of the set as a whole"
p13923
aS' Three of the agents have reversable heads - nice touch with the headsets and I like the ID cards on their pants  Obviously the agents security system is based on some kind of crotch measuring device'
p13924
aS" This would make sense considering the conspicuous bulges in the pants of Dr Inferno's men (see the other Agents set reviews ) The villains - Spy Clops, Dr Inferno, Gold Tooth"
p13925
aS" Dr Inferno's hair in all it's glory  This is a great piece, although the orange colouring is a little rough on the front"
p13926
aS" It's so 3D, it deserves a back and side view (and indeed EB thread) all of its own"
p13927
aS" As mentioned elsewhere, this is different plastic to the normal minifig hair, but it doesn't quite feel as soft as the Exo-force hair  It doesn't fall off as much, anyway  The figs get 10/10 from me"
p13928
aS" Awesome hairpieces in great colours for the Agents and a sleek navy blue/ neon green uniform  The villains' faces are great and they are all very distinctive"
p13929
aS" The attention to detail is outstanding and it's great to see a Lego in-house theme with characters as memorable and cool as figs from the licensed themes "
p13930
aS' Part 3: The build The build is divided into three stages - the small vehicles, the front of the truck, and the massive command center section  (a) Small vehicles First up, all the small vehicles'
p13931
aS' We have a small flyer, 2 buggies, jet ski, and a speed boat - all in glorious navy blue with little bits of silver detailing  Top view  These vehicles are all simple, small and well-designed'
p13932
aS' Probably the weakest is the flyer, only because the cockpit looks a little large'
p13933
aS' In fact, the small flyer is probably the weakest element of 8365 overall, which tells you how good the set itself is! In various threads here, this set has been heavily criticised for being way out of proportion'
p13934
aS" There's a reason for that, as we shall come to  However, the existence of these small sets should appease some people"
p13935
aS" With the new coast guard sets, for example, all of these save the flyer wouldn't look out of place on a City beach with a little modding"
p13936
aS" Here's an example - agents beach party! (Spongebob couldn't help but crash"
p13937
aS") The villains only have one small vehicle, but they've been well-served in the smaller sets, and this one is a unique and clever design"
p13938
aS' I love the triangular shape and the simple but clever technique of making the arch slopes meet up around the propellers'
p13939
aS" It's sort of insectile in black and orange, and looks very different from the usual assortment of helicopters etc  (b) Truck front This thing is a beast! Seriously, look at it"
p13940
aS" It's chunky and mean looking  You don't want to mess with this baby  The build is really nice  Like a lot of Star Wars vehicles, it's all based on technic beams pinned together"
p13941
aS" Unlike a lot of Mars Mission sets, underneath isn't ALL technic beams with some plates slapped on like a facade  The majority is a lot of plates and bricks which all fit together solidly"
p13942
aS" You can see from the detailing of 'cheese grater' slopes and silver pieces on the front how effort has been made to give this vehicle a distinct feel different to other Lego sets"
p13943
aS' Sure, the silver slope mirrors might be a bit too much for some, but this baby is all about attitude'
p13944
aS" You can imagine it roaring down the road en route to Dr Inferno's diabolical lair! After all, these sets are 'Agents' sets - nobody said they were *secret* Agents (c ) Command center - whole assembly Here's a view of the whole thing assembled - inside and cool details to follow at the end"
p13945
aS" It's kind of hard to show here as it is extreeeeemely long  This is indeed a big set  The build for the trailer part of the command center is fun and very satisfying"
p13946
aS' Yes, there are large pieces but there is also a huge amount of detail  It is also solid as a rock'
p13947
aS' I remember being annoyed building the big Ferrari truck a few years ago - everytime you looked at it, an 8 x 16 plate fell off'
p13948
aS' The Mobile Command Center is solid - even with the hinged roof and special features, it is not delicate at all  Kudos to the designers, again as it is mainly a brick build rather than a technic one'
p13949
aS" I also like how the command center part connects to the cabin - it's not a special piece at all, just a technic axle going through two circle plates, but it works and it's solid"
p13950
aS" (Please note I've been selective about which stickers I've applied during the build"
p13951
aS") Top view: The rear: Here's an example of why I like the build: (a) the designers have enough sense to put a ladder so a minifig can climb up to the interior when the command center is open (b) notice that although the ladder clips at the top, there is an *extra* clip there in the middle purely to hold it in place so it doesn't flap around and holds firm"
p13952
aS" I don't know if most designers would even think to put a ladder there let alone go the extra mile and put a mechanism to hold it in place  Pure class"
p13953
aS' Oh, and notice the greebly detail stuff to the right there too  The other side  This is probably the other weak part of the build - the bricky gaps at the top where the hinge to open the roof sits'
p13954
aS" It's a little gappy but the set is so big you don't really notice  (d) And now for the fun stuff - inside and neat details! OK, so we've built the thing  It's big  It's blue"
p13955
aS' The top of the trailer itself would make a good warehouse MOC for a harbour layout'
p13956
aS" But what about inside? Is it any good? What about all those small vehicles from the start of the review? Where do they go? Well, I'm glad you asked  Because the solution is superb"
p13957
aS" The small flyer folds slightly and slides into place here: Lift off the roof and you're away! The large buggy and the speedboat go under here: The jetski slides out of the rear here, attached to its own little platform: And the small buggy goes inside the main cabin"
p13958
aS" There's even a crane so you can lift it down  So now we know why this set is so large! To fit everything in! It's amazing that this functionality doesn't affect the aesthetics of the set as a whole"
p13959
aS" But we still haven't finished on the details"
p13960
aS" The front section has a very easy-to-swing-open roof section and missiles: There's also a command section underneath the bit where the flyer lifts out: And now for the interior"
p13961
aS" I have to say I really like this space  Not only is it packed with great stuff, there's also enough room for minifigs to move around"
p13962
aS' I hate bases where the figs only have about 2 studs to actually stand and walk  Aquabase Invasion is a nice set, for example, but the actual functional space inside the base is teensy'
p13963
aS" Claustrophobia! You know within a week they'd be fighting to toss each other out of the airlock"
p13964
aS' No such problems for these suave Agents, who have plenty of legroom *and* the ability to launch missiles from their ceiling  The whole of the interior: Zooming in: Moving from left to right'
p13965
aS" First off, the medicine cabinet  Looks like someone's been leaving secret mission dossiers lying around  The projector area for mission briefings"
p13966
aS' Dr Inferno recently changed his hair colour from purple to orange, it seems  Why are all these minifigs so obsessed with their hair? The projector folds down when the trailer is open'
p13967
aS" Push the button and the light glows on  Now Dr Inferno's hair is orange again! This is one of my favourite parts of the set  It works a charm"
p13968
aS' The batteries for these lightbricks can also be replaced - instructions are in the manual  Agent Charge considers shark-fin soup for dinner'
p13969
aS' Did I mention these projection panels are printed? The detail is very fine too  The tool section  Laptops sit in the middle compartment'
p13970
aS' You get some flippers, yellow scuba tank and various implements'
p13971
aS" I'm so impressed that the helmet is pearl silver with a different coloured visor too - there's so much variation in the parts in this set, you don't get the sense the designers are using the same thing over and over to save money"
p13972
aS' It all feels luxe and top-of-the-line, just like the Command Center itself  Two laptops - yay! The aforementioned rooftop missiles: The Dr Inferno cage'
p13973
aS' Nasty electric shocks! Bzzt! (You can see my reviewing skills are burning out now - sentences     truncated  '
p13974
aS") Another example of detail - nowhere else in the set is a 1x1 transgreen tile used - they could have used a 1x1 trans green cheese wedge piece as there are others in the set, but they didn't"
p13975
aS' How does Dr I get out? Flick that lever on the right hand exterior and the door pops open  Spy Clops the loyal minion awaits his master on the other side  And there we have it'
p13976
aS" Take a bow, guys! There's a lot of spare parts  A suspicious amount of dark blue small slopes but I checked the instructions and didn't see anything missing"
p13977
aS' I have to say, I do like the new policy (since Speed Racer I think) of including these small slopes as extras'
p13978
aS" Part 4: Overall Rating If you've made it this far, you've got more stamina than Dr Inferno's army of cyborg animals themselves! As I said earlier, this set has drawn criticism for the size of the truck"
p13979
aS' However, large vehicles do exist - I grew up in a wheat farming area and as a kid the size of the lorries that thundered past carrying grain was probably intimidating to me as this monstrous espionage machine is to the good citizens of Lego City! On top of that, it *does* contain a plethora of 4-wide vehicles inside ! Criticism of this set on the basis of size to me also seems misguided as this is basically a playset - and it is a very good one to boot'
p13980
aS" As you can probably tell, I love it to pieces and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone, whether for parts or for play value"
p13981
aS" Check out the parts list in this folderwhen moderated and you can see just how many excellent pieces it contains  A light-up brick, a flood of navy blue, metallic silver bricks - we're spoiled"
p13982
aS' 8635 is also an enjoyable build, with fantastic figs and top-of-the-line detailing'
p13983
aS" In a year when I've found City a bit disappointing after the run of great sets in 2006-2007, the Agents line has been one of the surprise hits for me and I can't wait to see what the designers come up with next"

aS' This mining vehicle is solid, compact, and well-designed'
p14106
aS" It looks impressive, and even better, it has fantastic Power Functions operability! Behold 7645 - MT-61 Crystal Reaper! (PS I wasn't joking about the holograms or seat belts"
p14107
aS') Part 1: Box, Instructions, DSSs (Dreaded Sticker Sheets), Parts Front of box: Back of box: 2 x instruction booklets: DSS numero uno - for the Reaper DSS number two - apologies for the blurry pic but I wanted to capture the sweet shimmy of the metallic holographic background on this sheet The way it catches the light really makes a difference to the small alien craft and makes it look much more interesting from the plain stickers of last year'
p14108
aS" There's heaps of spare silvery stuff once the stickers are applied for those who use the leftover sticker material for customising"
p14109
aS" Parts bags - 4 numbered with one extra with larger pieces Parts everywhere - woo! I know the Lego instruction books scold me if I mix bags, but I'm a devil-may-care kind of guy  In your face, TLC"
p14110
aS" I love mixing all the parts together before I build, it reminds me of my youth when the days were long, anything was possible, and I didn't need strict instructions not to build on grass or poke my eye out with a technic shooter"
p14111
aS" Interesting parts - these may or may not be new, my technic knowledge is not that detailed  The little scoop parts are so cute and have a heap of potential uses  I love 'em"
p14112
aS" They're like Smurf hats at Miniland scale  These technic wheel things in orange are also cute  They kind of remind me of marigolds"
p14113
aS" Giant Fabuland marigolds! The track pieces - you get 70 of these - here's the section of track for one side - as you can see it's about 52 studs long"
p14114
aS' These hold together better than the small ones on the Hailfire Droid/ Jungle Cutter'
p14115
aS' Part 2: Minifigs, small mining transport, alien ship I have to confess - I forgot to take an individual snap of the astronauts '
p14116
aS" It's the usual bunch though - Scaredy Face guy, Sunglasses in Space Man and a third one I can't remember"
p14117
aS" You don't really care, though? You're only interested in the alien commander and his matching arms/ legs combo deal"
p14118
aS' As brickbitz noted in his review of the smaller set, the glowy eye is just a 1x1 cylinder  The set also comes with 2 normal jellies - one pictured here for size'
p14119
aS" You'll see what happened to the other one soon enough    The alien craft is nothing exciting, apart from the gorgeous glinting stickers  Here's the road safety angle"
p14120
aS" The commander actually clips onto a 1x2 plate with handle so he can't fall out! Then the lime tentacle thing descends on top of him to keep him firmly there, like a baby seat"
p14121
aS' Not very brave for an alien commander, is he? I mean, did Darth Vader ever use a seatbelt? Tssk'
p14122
aS" With cradle up: This part of the build also includes the small astronaut mining buggy - small and effective  (Please note in this build I've applied stickers to everything bar cockpit pieces"
p14123
aS') This comes with radio and saw piece  Part 3: The Reaper! The first part of the build is the detachable shuttle'
p14124
aS' I really like the retro aesthetic of this with the angled wings and the side hoverpod things  It is much better than the comparable vehicle from 7699'
p14125
aS" The new flickfire piece is a waste of space - it's fairly limp  I prefer the simple flickfire technic pin to be honest  There's also a very nice little side workshop as you can see"
p14126
aS" I really like how the control unit is 'plugged' into the wall via 5 1x1 round plates (third pic, it's a bit dark)  Great detail"
p14127
aS' [The technic pins on the back are there to connect the Power Functions battery box'
p14128
aS" It's odd they're included at this stage of the instructions - maybe the intention was to release it originally with all the necessary motors etc but the price point was too high and they scaled it back] The base"
p14129
aS' The shuttle sits on that bley technic axle in the middle when the Reaper is fully assembled'
p14130
aS' The little vehicle scoots down the ramp at the rear, which folds up to hold it in place when the Reaper is in motion'
p14131
aS" You can see there's a crystal container here as well - another nice small detail which I found the 2007 sets lacked"
p14132
aS" There's also an alien here - thankfully not in those horrendous trans-orange tubes so prevalent last year  The complete assembly"
p14133
aS" Isn't it snug? It's just the right size too - not massive but large enough to be a serious mining vehicle"
p14134
aS' The ominous black treads contrast nicely with the white/ orange colour scheme of the vehicle itself'
p14135
aS' The trans detailing - blue for weapons, neon green for energy - is carried nicely through the whole set  The blades and the scoops whirl nicely as the machine trundles along'
p14136
aS" Top down view: Tread detail: Whirling blades of death! The buggy descends: Probably the most disturbing aspect of the whole set is this pic: The jelly has an orange pump plugged into its heart which is connected to an energy supply on the left hand side! This vehicle runs on alien jelly juice! Either that or it's milking the jelly in some equally disturbing fashion"
p14137
aS" How amoral is that! I know there's been debate about this - the jellys aren't innocent, they're evil energy crystal thieving maniacs etc - but I find it a bit odd that the humans respond by chaining the jelly up to the bowels of their mining vehcile and suck energy from its heart"
p14138
aS" People debate about violence in Lego as represented by realistic minifig weapons, but I think the moral lesson here is even worse - it's OK to exploit foreign life forms for our own gain if they treat us badly first! (Who-fans, I think the Ood should have a word with the jelly Commander ) That aside, this set is well-designed and fairly good value at $AUD79"
p14139
aS"95  It's definitely a notch above last year's Mars Mission sets overall, with improved detailing and more useful functions"
p14140
aS" The holo-stickers are fab and it's nice to have an alien commander, even if he is a bit bulky and his fingers are identical to his toes"
p14141
aS" However, if all these reasons by themselves weren't reason to recomend this set, the following is   "
p14142
aS' Part 4: Power Functions The best part of this set - and the reason I bought it, really - is the integration of Power Functions'
p14143
aS" Bizarrely this isn't mentioned at all on the box and I only found out about it from the instructions when they were posted on Eurobricks! (Instructions for book 2 which has the Power function stuff available here"
p14144
aS') This is a great idea and hopefully we will see more new sets take this kind of approach (especially with the new Train sets)'
p14145
aS' Luckily I got Monster Dino 4958 on sale for half price earlier this year so already had most of the necessary motors etc - the only one needed was an extra small one'
p14146
aS" What you need is listed in the instructions below with redirections to Shop @ Home to buy the motors  Note there's actually a mistake on this page"
p14147
aS' The 2 small motors you need are both 8883 not 8882 (which is the large XL motor)'
p14148
aS' Way to confuse the kids there, Lego! Attaching them was a dream and only took a few minutes (In contrast to 4958 where it was almost impossible to remove motor elements without dismantling the model)'
p14149
aS' Basically the back platform and some plates and orange slopes come off, you attach the motors, and then the smaller plates go back on'
p14150
aS" These parts are now left loose: Overall the look of the Reaper isn't badly effected as you're mainly viewing from the front anyway: Sadly I can't show you how it moves, you'll just have to trust me that it does ! The way it is steered is demonsrated in the instruction pages above"
p14151
aS' Basically each motor is controlled by a corresponding switch on the remote  Move them both forward to move forward, move one right to turn right, move both back to move back etc'
p14152
aS" It zips along! It's a speedy little thing! Personally I wouldn't want to be in it's path as it comes roaring down the Martian canyon! (My cat was scared as it was"
p14153
aS") It is oodles of fun and definitely worth trying if you have the motors or can get them cheaply, and adds a whole new dimension to the 'play' aspect of 'playset'"
p14154
aS' It is also as I said very quick to switch between modded and non-modded Reaper in contrast to the more fiddly Dino creations'
p14155
aS' The only problem I had is that if it moves too fast, the weight of the battery box at the back tends to pull the whole thing back and it rears up  It does correct itself though'
p14156
aS' I only trialled this on carpet last night so it may behave differently on other surfaces - I will need to experiment! Part 5: Summation This is a great set made even better with the addition of Power Functions'
p14157
aS" At $AUD79 95 it's well-priced  Buy it! Buy the motors as well (K-Mart still has stock of 4958 at $89, wait for a 15% off sale)! You won't regret it"
p14158
aS" Buy 2 and make competing battle machines! The only thing is    just don't torture that poor jelly Edited by Sinner, 24 June 2008 - 03:25 AM "

p14273

p14283
aS" Never mind! Here we have the handle that allows you to pick it up safely  A good idea, but it's placed waaaay to far back, way off the center of balance"
p14284

p14286
aS" It's centered pretty well, too, and you don't have to worry about knocking it over, just don't shove it back at all  Here we have the latch  When the button on top is pushed, this gets pulled inward "

p14288

p14484
aS' Firstly, I must emphasize that I am not a very big Harry Potter fan or owned many Harry Potter sets'
p14485
aS' For this review, I will be highlighting what is the beauty of this small little set, and the reasons to own multiple sets of it  Comments and critics are strongly welcomed'
p14486
aS" This set is featured in the Harry Potter movie, Prisoner of Azkaban  This set is orignally released in 2004, align with the Harry Potter's movie"
p14487
aS' This was actually one of the movie scene where Buckbeak the griffin is appeared in the movie  The group of students are supposed to be having up close and personal with him'
p14488
aS' However, Draco decided to disturb our lovely Buckbeak  Enough of this movie synopsis, I am sure fans of Harry Potter will know this better'
p14489
aS' Box art Featured mini-fig/creature Background scene The scene is a simple garden, which had a very good mixture of spare parts for your MOCs building'
p14490
aS" On its own, there is nothing outstanding about this set, except for the griffin  You can buy multiple sets for the griffin alone and for Draco mini-fig  Well, you don't need lots of Draco"
p14491
aS' But for Castle lovers, black cap are exceptionally useful, at least from my view  Now, I will point out the following why this sets is so great for other reasons'
p14492
aS' Hidden cover Note that, this is the only mechanism which you can find in this set  It looks rather simple but quite useful  There are some little things hide in it too'
p14493
aS' Greens, Foilage and Brown parts Needless to say much, it offer 3 foilage, a green plant, 3 brown slopes, 2 ideal bricks and 1x1 brown brick for building a tree'
p14494
aS' Great for jungle building, forest building and etc  I am sure there are many builders will look out for these'

p14498
aS' One of my entries, which is under the History theme  The Deep Forest Ambush was firstly inspired by this set, and made an improvement out of it  Look at the improved tree compared with the orignal'
p14499
aS' Summary review Playability: 4/10 (Not much to play with, except swooshing around the Griffin) Design: 5/10 (Too simple and its defintely not related with the movie scene) Parts: 10/10 (Great for parts, explained by the review'
p14500
aS' A great deal of green and brown parts) Price: 9/10 (An inexpensive set based on the 2004 pricing) Overall: 7/10 (A must have for all Harry Potter fans and collectors whom needs a great use of green and brown parts) Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine'

p14507
aS' It\'s a case of an old part coming back for a slightly new use, in a new colour  Beyond that, the "stone print" tile is a bundle or rolled up blanket or package, depending on where it\'s used'

aS' Thanks for the nice review - it was one of the first ones I got when emerging from my dark ages '

aS' I bought two of these, just for Buckbeack - I thought he would make a good statue in a Persian temple type MOC'
p14538
aS' I also liked the minifig head pumpkin and plant part in bright green - both new pieces to me at the time'

aS' Guys, thanks for your kind comments! I am glad that you have enjoyed this review  For this set, I think I bought about 7 to 8 sets, all for the griffins'
p14542

aS" imperialshadows, on Jun 9 2008, 11:13 PM, said: A very nice little review of a pretty nice little set that I wish I'd bought between 1 and 10 of  Just for the griffin  Oh well"
p14544
aS" Your review has shown me that it's useful for more than just that, so maybe I'll try to pick one up someday  Can't have too many black capes, books, or printed things"
p14545
aS" Speaking of which: The gray thing is technically a plume, like any castle plume, except in this case it's a feather (presumably from the griffin), and made from the mold to the old Indian feathers in the Wild West sets"
p14546
aS' It\'s a case of an old part coming back for a slightly new use, in a new colour  Beyond that, the "stone print" tile is a bundle or rolled up blanket or package, depending on where it\'s used'
p14547
aS" I don't think it's ever meant to be a stone  It was used as a rolled up pack on the back of the Star Wars speederbikes, for example  Nice pics, plenty of useful information"
p14548
aS" I'd give this review an A+ Thanks for doing it! I am very happy that you enjoyed and find my review useful  Thanks for enlighten me  Now, I know where is the origin of that gray plume"
p14549
aS' I wonder if I can use it to match with my castle knights as its plume  In addition, I mistook the rolled up pack as the stone print tile'
p14550
aS" Why didn't I think of it? I must have overlook it, and used it as a stone tile instead  Nevertheless, I am glad you have give me some good insights on the parts that I am not familar with"

tp14605
Rp14606
aS" Hello EB! Yes, I'm cranking out the reviews! The other day I picked up this gem for an okay sales price at Devonport, Tas, while searching for the new Batsets"
p14607
aS" I informed iamded of this as he is a Spidey-suckup ( ) and he informed me this was the only set he didn't have of the Wave 2 of this theme"
p14608
aS" So I ask you great EB members to please remind him of this when commenting! Here we go with the review of Doctopus' lair: Anyway, unlike other reviews, this stars more people, the Batbrick-iamded-dragonator-Daisy review! (Daisy is the mouse that came in the set) First up re the figs, and I must say they are great"
p14609
aS' I love fleshies and these are excellent to expand my Batman world, plus having a Spiderman to beat up is good too Doctopus is great, though his tentacles are annoying to keep in order'
p14610
aS' Peter Parker is a nice addition, I love that torso  Eve though Harry Osborn was totally absent from this scene, I welcome him as he is a good fig also'
p14611
aS" Best of all is Mary Jane, fleshie females are hard to come by and I love that hair, my very first one! Oh, and even better is bley Daisy on the far right: Another fantastic thing is that by mixing MJ with Doctopus you get a far more deadly and real villain than anyone could've forseen - The Hippy! Oh c'mon, tell me that ain't cool? Anyhoo, here is a pic of Doctopus showing his might: Random fact: Did you know I influence both dragonator and iamded in their sigfigs? dragonator adapts his from my IA series while iamded added Mutt hair when I had him like that in a pic I posted"
p14612
aS' Now onto the box, sorry about the lighting  The art is good and the cartoon spidey in the corner may have beenthe inspiration for a similar style in the new Batsets: Back of the box'
p14613
aS' Again, sorry about the lighting and blur, it was gtting late and these were the last pics: Finally we get to the first part of the set: The catapult'
p14614
aS" Is that movie accurate or what? I love the part in SM2 when he uses his homemade genetic spider powered catapult to launch himself to the scene! Oh well, it does comes with a cool spider web an trans blue spider, so it gets some points: And it is really fun! I launched spidey several metres once, I don't think he ever recovered"
p14615
aS' Infact, he almost certainly webbed himself Slightly cooler extras are these two'
p14616
aS' This awesome little boat is great for city, as is the simple but nice bouy, Daisy approves: Naturally dragonator ruins everything when he found out the "dragon" that would be riding with him was our nickname for Daisy Now finally, the main attraction - Coctopus\' Dock'
p14617
aS" iamded and I threw dragonator in the water to see if he could swim  He er, couldn't One Sweeney todd later, we continue! The overall construction of the building is very good"
p14618
aS' I know a lot of people hated stickers and i hated applying these, but they do look spectacular and perfect for any City setting, like a bank, a Gotham Bank As iamded has already noted below me the black lifesavers a very cool as are the web piece and log pieces: The inside contains the neutron copperplate triple bypass humdrum holy hum 5000, which does does, see movie'
p14619
aS' Anyhoo, it is very cool, and includes a little control thingy on the yellow brick next to it'
p14620
aS' Unfortunately, the inside is plain but for that: The other side has no wall too which is a bit of a letdown really, but atleast it allows Daisy easy access'
p14621
aS' one gripe is those yellow 1x1 bricks, they serve no purpose and break up the colour scheme: Better shot of the thingy thing'
p14622
aS' I quite like it, the use of technic parts actually works, and the whole set is worth it for those purple flames and dishes alone It closes up pretty well too, unable to hit the dish which is a nice feature: Me and iamded liked it so much we threw a revived dragonator into it'
p14623
aS' Unfortunately it disagreed with him, but it was fun: Another shot of the dock'
p14624
aS" I like how they have gaps in the jetty, I know the movie version was pretty wack, and although the set isn't very faithful to it (looks more like a seaside library to be frank) it still is very nice"
p14625
aS' This is my first large blue baseplate too which is wonderful, though funny how the set only uses about half of it: The roof is a well designed and fun feature, it uses some technic connections to render it flexible of any degree, as you can see here by my opening of it: Better shot of the roof design, it can lie flat or at any angle'
p14626
aS' I might use the design myself in the future: As much as I love the building this feature bugs me, for in order for it to work this wall has to stick out, which not only looks ugly but makes you be able to see through the corners'
p14627
aS' Still, easily modded, and log pieces are fantastic for mocing'
p14628
aS' It also means that there are 7 windows all up for a good, sizeable building: By pulling out the piece in the center the walls both collapss sideways outwards, which is actually pretty fun and works everytime: Overall view of the set including characters: Now for the story that makes no sense'
p14629
aS"at all: Spiderman is dead after falling down the wall mechanism (see above): Only Daisy can save the day! For dragonator is being held by the evil Doctopus! And iamded and dragonator are too busy not caring! And Brainbox is too busy complaining that this goes against all Marvel continuity! Unfortunately Daisy is on a lunchbreak so tough luck dragonator: And Daisy goes on a search for fortune and glory: Okay, this is what I think of the set: Build: 3/5 - Fun, but those stickers ruin the experience somewhat, and if you don't apply them the instructions are a bit hard to follow"
p14630
aS' Playability: 4/5 - Great little gizmos and bits, not the kind that keep you going like with the 2007 Aquabase, but good fun still'
p14631
aS' Design: 4/5 - Not very movie faithful no, but still a great little building and a smart design for certain aspects  Minifigs: 5/5 - Great figs with all different faces and very useful bits'
p14632
aS" Price: 2/5 Far, FAR overpriced even on sale sadly Total: 18/25 - A good set that could've been better with a few minor changes"
p14633
aS" Nothing wrong with it, but it doesn't really cross the line to greatness"
p14634
aS' That said, it has a lot going for it and definitely worth buying or atleast a look! Thanks for reading Batbrick Away! Edited by Batbrick, 13 June 2008 - 12:21 PM '
p14635
aS" Lookin' good so far! Though I must say it's Doc Ock, not Dok Ock  "
p14636
aS' The catapult is, well, ridiculous, but the boat is very spiffy, and the buoy is a nice addition! I actually like the stickers on the window pieces, perfect for this building, and great for post-Apoc scenes'
p14637
aS' Black life-saver rings are a nice addition too Anyway, hurry up dragonator and Batbrick! And Daisy! I want to see the rest of the review! ~iamded away!'

aS' Though not really a complaint, it would be nice if the entire astromech body was provided instead of only the head dome'
p14732
aS" :p Of course, then it wouldn't be movie-accurate, since the Q7 series astro-mech is integrated with the starfighter  :lol: He's definitely well-painted for a simple mini-fig"
p14733
aS" Since even the back is painted too  I have to assumed this is the same mini-fig provided for 7259 ARC-170 Starfighter too, since I don't have that set"
p14734
aS" Anyway, this mini-fig is much more accurate for this v-wing since his suit is rated against vacuum, while those in the arc-170 aren't "
p14735
aS" :p One thing that's lacking is the instruments panel in the cockpit    it's totally non-existent here  I wonder what went wrong during the design stage  Personally  "
p14736
aS' this is the second most anticipated set for 2006, the first being the tie interceptor, for me'
p14737
aS" One thing is that there's no known release of the V-wing starfighter by hasbro, nor the other well-known brands"
p14738
aS' The other thing is that being a star wars vehicle collector, I would really loved to see a replica toy of the V-wing  And the V-wing by the Lego Group does not disappoint  '
p14739
aS" it's nearly movie-accurate, except for the cockpit transparisteel cover which could used some paint like the x-wing's"
p14740
aS" Also, there's a permanent landing gear that quite neat, since it allows you to land the craft on uniform surfaces  The s-foils on the other hand can be quite a pain to pose into flight position"
p14741
aS' Very difficult for the s-foils to remain symmetrical during play  The "swoosh-able" or play factor of this product is quite good    just check out the pics for yourself  '
p14742
aS' :D *Crackle* General Skywalker, we have incoming! To conclude, the v-wing starfighter would make a much better companion to the Eta-2 Actis Interceptor (Jedi Starfighter), than the arc-170'
p14743
aS' Coz the arc-170 seems more like a long-range bomber to me, than a snub-fighter  :p And a final pic to show it at rest  '
p14744
aS' Comments (For 2008) Just an updated pic to show my latest display on the clone wars Hmm  '
p14745
aS' off the record, I do understand that sometimes, reviews by most tend to a certain set of guidelines like naming the set, and showing the boxed, and out of boxed pics, and of course, the grading portion'
p14746
aS' Regarding my review, I prefer not to grade any of the lego sets at all as far as possible, because to each, his/her own'
p14747
aS' My reasons to put up a review is not to belittle the efforts of TLG in coming out with these products nor to help them market them, but to show my appreciation and enjoyment of these products'
p14748
aS' I hope noone is offended by this, and would like to apologise for any misunderstanding that this may caused  For those who do not understand the above paragraph, care not for it and Play On! Like Me'
p14749
aS' Thanks for the detailed review valentin it had good picture quality and a nice little comic near the end'
p14750
aS' Although this is a slightly older set it still was a good one, I remmeber that I bought two of them to build up a small airforce for the Republic, and if I see another one I may buy it for use in the Starwars Comic game'
p14751
aS' Keep up the good work  '
p14752
aS' Thanks for another great review  I remember getting a few V-Wings cheaper because the boxes had been crushed on their way to the store'
p14753

aS'com said: Challenge the Rebels! Blasting out of Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi, the TIE Interceptor is the fastest fighter in the Imperial fleet! Open the cockpit canopy and fold down the instrument panel to put the TIE pilot inside and recreate your favorite classic Star Wars battles! Includes TIE fighter pilot! Cockpit opens and instrument panel folds down! It does seem to have more pieces than the average tie fighter, but this is actually cheaper than the 7263 TIE Fighter'
p14832
aS" Of course, there's no light-up feature in this set  :sweat: YesH!! Finally    A  "
p14833
aS' Tie Interceptor!! This is probably the most anticipated for all set for all lego tie collectors worldwide, since the fighter, bomber, advanced, and even the Expanded Universe droid fighter had been released by the Lego Group'
p14834
aS" This set is near movie-accurate, since the bottom part of it ain't  :p The cockpit and pylons uses the same design as that of the tie advanced piloted by Darth Vader"
p14835
aS' Except for one minor change, that is the aft interior of the cockpit is strengthen this time'
p14836
aS" And this is indeed good news, since the older models had a problem of hard hinge and loose brick connection  There's no landing gear for this set, but it doesn't require it anyway"
p14837
aS' This tie interceptor balances perfectly on its wings  Standard instruments panel and, of course, standard imperial pilot  The "swoosh-able" or play factor of this set is definitely very high  '
p14838
aS" Just take a look  :D *Camera view from own craft* *Camera view from Tie-Advanced* *Combat simulation of Endor's Battle from the archives* No bomber, since I started late in re-collecting"
p14839
aS" :p To conclude, for a typical lego fan, this set is a 60/40, 60 due to it's good design, and for a typical star wars fan, this is a must-get"
p14840
aS' The only flaw for this set is the same flaw for any lego set in SG, the price  :doh: Comment(Current in 2008) Being a starwars fan    no  '
p14841
aS' being a typical toy collector, space is definitely a premium    so much so that I turned to lego starwars to sate my appetite for more starwars products when I already have no more display space'

aS' For the next few non-lego pictures, they are the crown of my starfighter collection in 1/18 scale'

p14879
aS' There are 3 cheese slopes and two 1x2 tiles that glow in the dark, where the tiles are exclusive for this set  The total parts count is high at 142, but there are no really big pieces among them'
p14880
aS' Inside the box you will find the building instructions, a sheet with some odd sticky labels (thrown away) and 3 polybags marked by the bag building difficulty'
p14881
aS" The models The lime colored car doesn't bring out anything new  We have seen racers built like that before, but it does contain some nice bricks for the collection"
p14882
aS' The police cruiser surprises with an interesting design along the sides as seen here'
p14883
aS" It is harder to build because of the greater level of details: The helicopter is without doubt the hardest vehicle to build in a bag  I can't finish it because it's larger than the bag"
p14884
aS" You can't put on the top blades nor the tail of the thing, so it beats the forklift from 7733 where the top bar is the new kind that doesn't completely fit"
p14885
aS' There is also instructions for the alternate models, but it requires the bags to be opened  '
p14886
aS' The vehicles are pretty standard for the racers theme with the police car being the highlight of the set Conclusion I like the difficulty curve between bag 1 and 2, but the last bag should be labeled 1000000 instead of 3'

p15061
aS' must have!!" Me:"Goodbye" [pushes the incinerator button] Ph4tDuD3:"wut?! nooooooooooooooooooo           " and on that note, let\'s start the reivew of the UCS DEATH STAR II'
p15062
aS" Now this is an older set (2005) and I've only gotten around to buying it a short while ago  It took me around 2 evenings to build it and I must say that I am fairly impressed by this set"
p15063
aS" Time for a box pic: The Build: Since I started building this huge (small moon size) set at Morten's appartment, I wanted to keep as few polybags open at any given time as possible"
p15064
aS' With this set it is actually possible to have a minimum of bricks scattered over a table or two while building  Not sure why, but the division of bricks in the different polybags just work very well'
p15065
aS' And that is great with a set this size - 3441 bricks  The building of the set is divided into several "Build this times x"'
p15066
aS' For example the upper and lower part of the "unshielded" DS are completely alike'
p15067
aS' This is difficult to see when looking at the model, but heaven when building it: And this is how they solved the problem of having the wings connected to the buttom of the Death Star - geniously done IMO: Note that in the first pic the "skeleton" is easily seen'
p15068
aS' "The skeleton" holds the X to which both the upper and lower part is "clicked" on with technic pins'
p15069
aS' Also there\'s a steering wheel (I\'m sure there\'s a pirate name for that ) like the one in the bottom, in the top of the model to hold the upside "wings"'
p15070
aS' So after having build duplicate wings (upper and lower), the "belt" (all the way around the star) and the upper and lower part of the "unshielded" side, it was time to step back and watch the Death Star II in all it\'s glory: Such a great UCS set'
p15071
aS' Now I did have a few "huh\'s" during the build: HUH! #1 In the instruction the technic lesser-dragon-head should be dark grey, but I got it in light gray  Go figure and thank you replacement parts'
p15072
aS' I\'ve experienced this before and apparently TLG uses different colours when "out-of-stock"  All one has to do is call them and ask for the right colour and it\'s on it\'s way Still a HUH! experience'
p15073
aS' HUH! #2 Again it appears that TLG changed the design of the technic axleholed 1x2 bricks  The bottom has changed and I got the set where it was mixed up between "old" and "new" version'
p15074
aS' Not that annoying, but still got me perplexed as to: "Am I doing this right?" Kinda stressing to consider taking most of the star apart to check the remaining 231 technic bricks 1x2 with axlehole'
p15075
aS' Now for a verdict: : 1: looks great 2: even my "wife" likes it - female appeal 3: it\'s a great build 4: the polybags work for you 5: it\'s Star Wars 6: the design is awesome : 1: it wobbles if you touch it 2: very small parts come off, if you touch it 3: parts come off when you try to move it somewhere safe 4: zero swooshability So in short (yes even shorter]: The DSII is a well designed UCS set that has a great design'
p15076
aS" Like most other UCS sets, it is not meant for play - hence don't play with it"
p15077
aS" UCS verdict (the numbers) 5/10 (design++/instructions+-/bricks+-/sturdiness--/colourscheme+-) design: awesome look and great greeble set instructions: easy to follow steps with bricks mentioned hard to see wether it's black or dark grey bricks: loads of great bricks a zillion bricks of the same type sturdiness: DON'T TOUCH colouscheme: grey in grey with a little touch of black Need a missing instruction? Then click the logo"
p15078
aS" Thanks for the review KimT - it comes at a    confusing time You can take off the top disk and lift it like the Millennium Falcon from the top Now  I actually don't like this set that much"
p15079
aS' It takes about 5 hours and 15 minutes to build if you do it in one go, but the repeating sections makes this built the most tedious I have experienced'
p15080
aS' It has way too many holes from which you can see the colorful skeleton and is overpriced compared to the older 10030 ISD'
p15081
aS' I remember thinking it was too expensive when it was 50% off at S@H! Even the Snowspeeder was "kewler" to less than half the price:'
p15082
aS' Hmmm, ive still got this set and i must say, i think you did a good job of reviewing it  But  '
p15083
aS' Overall, i hate the set, probably the worst UCS set so far (apart from the naboo fighter but that hardly even counts as UCS) from my experience'
p15084
aS' Unless you really really want it and have nothing better to spent your $$$ on, in that case go for it  But in my case, it was a very repetitive build and final model was quite  '

p15199

aS' Name: Troll Warrior Theme: LEGO System / Castle Year: 2008 Pieces: 19 Minifigs: 1 An image of a 5618, Troll Warrior Let the march begin The mighty brave troll warrior, carrying a dangerous cart equipped with a "flick" fire missile'
p15304
aS" Marching into the lands of the Crown Kingdom  Crown Knights must be ready for this new troll addition  From what I see, this set has a very minimum piece count since it's an impulse set"
p15305
aS' There is no unique parts found in this set  However, this set has a couple of useful accessories, such as 2 spears and 2 wooden wheels and a grey mouse running around'
p15306
aS' This set is another alternative for Castle Army builders to buy multiple sets, to build a massive Troll armies  In addition, the flick missile really works'
p15307
aS' Use a little bit of force from your finger and flick it, the missile will fly  Well, it certainly does not impress me at all with such playing feature'
p15308
aS' Base of the cart Different angles There is one thing I dislike about this set  The wooden wheels are too big, and it is the same as the ones in the Crossbow attack'
p15309
aS' I prefer the smaller wheels that exist in old castle sets that produced smaller cart  Since this cart size is similar to the old cart size'
p15310
aS" The old wizard's cart is a very good example of the proposed wheel  Bits and Pieces Close-up on the warrior and the mouse Summary review Playability: 5 5/10 (The playability feature is not fanastic"
p15311
aS') Design: 6 5/10 (Design is adequate  If the wheels is much smaller and the flicking thing disappear, the score will be much higher) Price: 8/10 (An inexpensive set to get a troll warrior and a mouse'
p15312
aS") Overall: 6/10 (To conclude, this set is good only for army builders  A new range of millitary vehicle to be added  That's all) Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine"

p15478
aS' Now, I am illustrating him as a life guard instead  This set is simply wonderful  Among the 4 new impulse sets, Coast Guard Kayak is the best looking set in my opnion'
p15479
aS" The kayak design is very simple but looks realistic   Furthermore, if you don't need it to be a coast guard kind of stuff  Use it as a leisure water spot instead down in the marina"
p15480
aS' I will think any LEGO citizen will love to have some water spot in their busy life  So come down here and wind down with this new sport'
p15481
aS' Bits and Pieces Kayak and the bouy The bouy is very useful to position it at the coast of your water to highlight the boundaries in the sea, and warning incoming ships or vessels'
p15482
aS' Oh, I did not make it tilted purposely  There is a white round base which allow it to tilt on both ends  Useful parts These parts are useful to add on in your city'

aS' 7663 Sith Infiltrator Year: 2007 Number of Pieces: 310 Number of Minifigs: 1 Price: 29'
p15737
aS'99 USD Brickset Hello everyone, and welcome to my second review on Eurobricks, the Sith Infiltrator! Lets start with a pic of the box, shall we? As you can see, its a Limited Edition set, meaning the fig and set could be worth a lot in the future'
p15738
aS' This set takes about 20 minuets for the seasoned builder'
p15739
aS' An overview of the Infiltrator (also know as the Scimitar): As seen in the picture, this ship is very sleek, with very few studs on top (SNOT= Studs Not On Top)'
p15740
aS' Basically, Its the cockpit with two wings (with two "fins" on each wing), attached to the hull'
p15741
aS' Heres a side view of the Scimitar: Very cool- looking! It lands on two "feet" in the front while the cockpit rests on the ground  Rear view: The back'
p15742
aS' The outer cockpit is beautiful, a printed piece on the back (no dreaded sticker sheet! (DSS)) and a large printed disc on top: Heres a look at the middle: There is a flick-fire missile (trans-red cone attach to Technic pin) on the inner wing, a trans-red lightsaber blade in the back of the hull, and a trans-red lightsaber blade in between the fins on either side'
p15743
aS' All of those lightsaber blades may come in handy    Hey, look: the fins open from the wings!: The fins open due to double hinges on each fin'
p15744
aS' Unfortunately, you have to hold the ship up in order for the bottom fins to open'
p15745
aS' Now, lets have a look inside the cockpit: To open, you lift the back printed part, which is attached to the printed disc on top, which is attached to a hinge'
p15746
aS' It opens pretty smoothly, but is somewhat loose, so sometimes it closes on its own  Also, the disc isnt secured well enough to the door, and often breaks off, even with the smallest movement to it'
p15747
aS' Inside, there is an elevated control panel and two sliding pieces near the floor  This ship also comes with a small speeder bike: Its very cleverly built, and is a really neat addition'
p15748
aS' See that clear disc on the bottom? It fits perfectly into the sliding pieces in the cockpit: Hmm  '
p15749
aS" whats this?: A hidden compartment! Now this was a very cool idea by TLG, a secret compartment found by taking off the top slope of the hull contains Darth Maul's weapons and tools which include: A (CHROME!) lightsaber hilt, a pair of electrobinouculars, and three probe droids"
p15750
aS' A closeup of a probe droid: Just a plain, black minifig head with a black lever on top  Finally, the fig: Darth Maul in the flesh plastic'
p15751
aS' A good fig altogether, with a black hood and lightsaber blades taken from the ship'
p15752
aS' He did come with a crisp, new black cape (packaged in a small, white cardboard box), but I am currently using it for another fig  Note that this is a limited edition fig, so stock up'
p15753
aS' A comparison pic of the two Mauls: The 2007 version is on the left, and the 1999 version on the right'
p15754
aS' Note a few key differences between the two: the new one has smaller red tattoos and a smoother torso  Also, the new one has bigger eyes and a more cartoony look'
p15755
aS' Maul on the speeder bike: Of course, he fits perfectly in the cockpit wile sitting on the bike, and he can reach the controls: Well, thats about it, here is the  '
p15756
aS' FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, easy and fun, breaks every once in a while'
p15757
aS' Playability: 7/10, this set has many features, but is very fragile between the cockpit and hull and between the two cockpit pieces'
p15758
aS' Swooshability: 1/10, too fragile to fly around, plus the flick fire missiles fall out  Minifigs: 9/10, a great fig with a chrome hilt and a double sided blade  A little cartoony'
p15759
aS' Design: 7/10, very clever techniques, very sleek, but very fragile  Price: 8/10, fair enough, could be a few dollars cheaper  Overall Score: 6'
p15760
aS'5/10, a very sleek ship with clever building and play techniques, but very, very fragile, and shouldnt be picked up off of the shelf too often'

aS' Through your recent reviews on these, it gave me a wider perspective of space  I loved to play space as a child such as the late classic and Futuron sets'
p15959
aS' Back to the review, this 6927 is a great mobile command center vehicle suitable for all kinds of harsh terrain in the unknown space  The 6 big wheels are real solid and firm back in those days'
p15960
aS" Transparent blue windscreen at the front, is wonderful  I just love these parts, especially when it's in blue  4 computer printed tiles"

CP5670, on Jul 11 2008, 01:39 PM, said: I just modified mine to make everything fully enclosed: I love your modified 6927 with the enclosed front'
p15999
aS' 2 weeks ago I modified my All-Terrain Vehicle as well, in a similar way, but just *slightly* more modified from the original'
p16000
aS' I call it: 6927-C \'All-Terrain Vehicle Improved Class\' a few clues for anyone to easily build this themselves: Also, a much more extensive modification/MOC that I call 6927-W "All-Terrain Warrior" Quote 6927-W \'All-Terrain Warrior\' I wanted to make a combat variant of 6927, so I used the 6927-C Improved Class as the starting point and went from there'
p16001
aS' I added a completely new forward-cab, close to the ground, for a ground--observer to monitor the terrain  I added even larger wheels, allowing this variant to truly be "all terrain",   '
p16002
aS'besides, what good is it having a combat vehicle if it gets stuck in the middle of a firefight? The 6927-W has a five man crew: a driver, a gunner who also serves as overall-commander, a terrain observer in the very front'
p16003
aS' In the lab are the weapons systems officer and computer/tech specialist  The All-Terrain Warrior vehicle portion is armed with lasers and blaster cannons, with options for other weapons'
p16004
aS' There are short-range nuclear rockets on the lab, guided by the rader control  The lab now has blast-proof shutters on the windows protecting the crew from rocket blast'
p16005
aS' Additional protection can be added to the lab, if-need-be, such as more extensive blast-shielding  All-in-all, the All-Terrain Warrior is a beast of a machine'
p16006
aS' Two 6927s can protect an entire convoy of standard 6927 or 6927-C'
p16007
aS' These are my very first attempts at modification and doing a MOC of Classic Space LEGO! Edited by ParallaxScroll, 29 August 2009 - 03:03 AM '

I didn't you are also a Space fan Oh how I love Classic Space The all time perfect LEGO space related theme Everytime I see one I want to buy them more and more, when compared to modern fang dangled sets with detailed figs and cool new accessories, they have nothing on Classic Space, simple beauty Maybe its the blue/grey/trans yellow color scheme Classic Space Forever Edited by Piranha, 30 August 2009 - 07:51 AM"

aS' Yeah, first time that I am getting a set before everyone ^^ First of all: The package The european version has no "Limited Edition" button  Hooray!!! Sorry for the blurry back-shot'
p16018
aS' We see the hospital back, a few bubbles with set functions and a little comic  Comic: Bubbles: The figures are injured Spongebob, Patrick and the new Fish Doctor  Spongebob has a headprint      '
p16019
aS'and a backprint (other than the normal Spongebob)  Spongebob and injured Bob: The set comes with two litters  The ambulance car is a bit extraordinary'
p16020
aS' I dont know how the car is like in the show (and I saw a lot of episodes) but it looks a bit strange, mostly because the weehls are too small  Of course we get another SS (not so D this time)'
p16021
aS' The litter fits in the back, with help of this lid  I wish it would be the hinge-lid from before 2004  '
p16022
aS' Now we come to the meanpart of the set: The hospital! The entrance has got babyblue traindoors and a hudge sign that shows "Emergency"  The tubes are nearly everywhere in this set'
p16023
aS' I was getting insane when I came to the part, where I must put the stickers on the tubes  This parts are very usefull, but I wanted that the set looks good, because I will display it'
p16024
aS' So I stickered just two of the parts and not all four  Now we come to the interroir: The doctor has a desk with computer  Sadly its not very well placed and he must duck because of his fin'
p16025
aS' Next to the door, we get this little case, wash basin and two drawers  Again we get stickers    Not that I dont like stickers'
p16026
aS' Its just: Everytime I get to the part where I must put the stickers on, I think how I can re-use the model and if I rebuild the model, later and and and  '
p16027
aS' I hate it to deside! A few posters are in it, too  The set is a great addittion to your own Bikino Bottom, but the playability is not very big for the kids'
p16028
aS' They can just play that Patrick steals the ambulance car, like shown on the package, and is hitting Spongebob  Than the drive back, the doctor gives Spongebob two medicines and let him go'
p16029
aS' I bought the set mostly because of the parts (tubes in lightbley and a few woodpieces)  But I am thinking about let it stand in my little Bikini Bottom (just consist of Crusty Crab and Chum Bucket)'
p16030

aS'99 USD Brickset Welcome to my third review on Eurobricks, I hope you enjoy! While at any store that sells LEGO (Target, Wal-Mart, TRU, etc'
p16305
aS'), you will notice that the clone battle packs on the shelf are way fewer in number than the droids battle pack'
p16306
aS' As you might guess, the clones are way more popular, and finding them gets harder and harder as the release date of this set goes farther into the past'
p16307
aS' So stock up! Alright, heres a pic of the box: A small box, as expected for inexpensive sets like these'
p16308
aS' Note the "Build your army" button on the front: TLG obviously is encouraging customers to buy multiples, and with good reason, which will be explained later in this review'
p16309
aS' Well, lets get straight to it: The contents of this set  You will notice a speeder bike, a gun turret, and some clones'
p16310
aS' Looking good so far! Lets have a look at the turret: An excellent Star Wars element to have around, especially for MOCing'
p16311
aS' It is very cleverly built, using a tire guard from CITY sets for the general shape of the turret mount'
p16312
aS' All you have to do is attach the (new mold! explained later) gun to the 2x1 plate with the center stud, and    Presto! I wonder how the clones build these turrets to fast in the middle of battle  '
p16313
aS' A rear view: With a clone mounted: My only gripe about the turret is that you have to take off the gun in order for every clone to have a gun'
p16314
aS' Now, we move on to the vehicle of the set, the speeder bike: A rather sleek and good looking bike, with some useful pieces on it as well, such as the blue cones, the megaphones, and the engines'
p16315
aS' Some say it looks bare without the figs mounted on it, but I think it looks just fine  The commander drives while a trooper shoots on the back'
p16316
aS' A side view: And a rear view: My only gripe is the same as the turret: you have to remove the back gun for all the clones to have weapons while on foot'
p16317
aS' The back pistol attaches to a 2x2 round studded plate with a Technic hole in the middle  Finnaly, here are the new guns: This set comes with 1 new blaster rifle and three new pistols'
p16318
aS' It could have included one more rifle for the turret'
p16319
aS' And of course, the figs: Includes: 1 yellow commander (lovely fig), 1 Shocktrooper (comes with a pair of elctrobinouculars), and two regular troopers (so clean and white)'
p16320
aS' The figs are excellent, all that any SW or LEGO fan should want  It could have maybe included one more regular trooper, but that might be pushing it  Thats all for now, folks, here is the  '
p16321
aS' FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, extremely easy, should take the seasoned builder about 5 minutes to complete  A fun build, though'
p16322
aS' Playability: 5/10, I guess you can get this with the droid battle pack and make them battle, but this set has no real play features of its own'
p16323
aS' But it is good for collecting troops and using them for MOCs  Swooshability: 9/10, I guess you can zoom the speeder bike around  '
p16324
aS' Minifigs: 10/10, four great figs that should be bought in multiples, a great army builder  Design: 10/10, a clever turret, an awesome speeder, and four great clones'
p16325
aS' What more do you need in a 10 dollar set? Price: 8/10, not bad I suppose, but if you calculate a dime for each piece, this set should come out to 5-6 dollars'
p16326
aS' But still, billions of these are being sold world-wide, and TLG is making a ton of money off of them  Overall score: 9'
p16327
aS'5/10, a truly memorable set, one that will be a favorite for ages to come, and very popular'
p16328
aS' A great army builder for a small price, plus vehicle and turret! With only a few very minor flaws, this set is one of the best of Star Wars'

aS' Note the guns on the front: The guns and cockpit can turn a little bit left and right from the main body'
p16391
aS' Also, the guns can move up and down, free from the cockpit: And check out the cockpit: Two 2x1 center studded plates side by side for the pilot to stand on'
p16392
aS' Now, moving on to the STAP: A small, very useful vehicle in the SW universe  These are seen frequently in both the movies and games (as well as other multimedia)'
p16393
aS' The design is very clever, using vertical building and a clear stand  Rear view: The guns/ handlebars can go this far back: And finally, the figs: The figs are very good, but very common'
p16394
aS' We havent seen SBDs in a while, and now instead of metallic blue, they are metallic dark grey'
p16395
aS' The worst part of this set is that the battle droids have the old arms and guns, while the droids in the MTT and clone pack (both of the same year as this) have the new ones'
p16396
aS' I wonder why TLG decided to do that  '
p16397
aS' again, This set originally came with four megaphone blasters for each battle droid, but I replaced them (along with the crooked arms) with the new blaster pistols and new twisted arms'
p16398
aS' So thats about it, heres the    FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, very easy, should take the seasoned builder about 5-10 minutes  Playability: 6/10, has a few play feature, but nothing exciting'
p16399
aS' Is good for MOCs and army building  Swooshability: 8/10, I suppose you could fly around the STAP  '
p16400
aS' Minifigs: 7/10, the battle droids are good, but very common, and the dont come with new arms or guns  The SBDs are very nice, and in a new color  All figs are great for army building'
p16401
aS' Design: 8/10, the STAP was clever, but the carrier was a little bulky  Price: 10/10, as fair as it gets  Overall: 7'
p16402
aS'5/10, the figs are great to have and make MOCs and armies, and the vehicles are pretty cool (the carrier is a little lame)'
p16403
aS' The main problem with this set is that the BDs dont get the new guns or arms, so they dont fit in with all the new sets  Also, droids arent as cool as clones  But the price is very fair'
p16404
aS' And now, my review has ended'
p16405
aS" Unfortunately, I believe this will be my last review for a long time for two reasons: one, the remaining sets that arent done (according to KimT's index) I either don't have or are broken or have missing pieces"
p16406
aS' and two, my budget is low right now, and I wont be able to get the Clone Wars sets right when they are released, so someone will probably beat me to reviewing them'
p16407
aS' Too bad, because I would love to do an RGS review    well, as always, comments very welcome!'

aS" Hello all Eurobricks members and Town Lovers, This is my first classic town review  For today, I will be featuring the 6641, 4-Wheelin' Truck which is produced in 1987"
p16445
aS' For some younger members in EB, you might not have encounter such a baby roaming down the streets, horning at others with its big massive truck'
p16446
aS" Considering this is a 1987 set, such a vehicle size is considered big in those days  Name: 4-Wheelin' Truck Theme: LEGO System / Town Year: 1987 Pieces: 80 Minifigs: 1 Price: USD$6"
p16447
aS'50 An image of a 6641, 4-Wheelin\' Truck *Hello Everyone* Why the name 4-Wheelin\' Truck? It is because this truck is equipped with 4 heavy duty wheels which is considered "big" among other small vehicles in Classic Town'
p16448
aS' Please take note, most of the vehicles that are produced in Classic Town era, are 4-studs wide  This truck is no exception'
p16449
aS' Meet the driver and his truck! This truck has a very good combinations of different colors that are common for most town vehicles  It made used of blue, white and red as its primary combinations'
p16450
aS' I find that this combinations is quite soothing to its eyes especially the blue bricks  In addition, the mini-fig torso is superb  The driver must be a great fan of this vehicle'
p16451
aS' I realised most truck drivers in the classic town era wear this most of the time'
p16452
aS' I wonder if its some kind of an organization? Front view There is 2 red doors coupled with the truck, to enable the driver to get in properly  This vehicle is considered big in the 1980s'
p16453
aS' However, if you compared it with the current city vehicles, this truck certainly will not outsize the current designs  Please take note of the wheels  The wheels are pretty different'
p16454
aS' I don\'t remember seeing these wheels in many other vehicles, maybe some members can help me on this  Most of the classic town vehicles have a window frame on top which is known as a "sun-roof"'
p16455
aS' In this set, this feature is also included  Furthermore, the vehicle frame has a simple mechanism which all town lovers love  It is to lift it up and place their driver in and out the seat'
p16456
aS' Most importantly, you do not have to take off the entire window frame just to put in the driver'
p16457
aS" Different angles of the 4-Wheelin' Truck SNOT Technique? Back 20 years ago, LEGO had been experimenting with SNOT technique  You can see that the back looks very neat without the studs"
p16458
aS' In addition, it can be quite useful to place a mini-fig on top of it, or throw some baggage for some quick getaway  Summary review Playability: 8/10 (Great addition to your Town collection'
p16459
aS') Design: 8 5/10 (Very good design  I love 4-studs truck  At least, it is able to occupy one side of the lane) Price: 9/10 (An inexpensive set based on the 1987 pricing) Overall: 8'
p16460
aS'5/10 (A must have for all Classic Town lovers, we have been complaining for more wider range of vehicle) I gave it a "4" based on my Review Score Card'
p16461
aS' What about yours? Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine  Pictures can be found in My Brickshelf (When moderated) Edited by WhiteFang, 13 July 2008 - 12:08 PM '

p16642
aS': 6455 Name: Space Simulation Station Number of minifigs: 3 Number of pieces: 240 Release Year: 1999 First again a few pics of the boxes and the instructions: The main box: This theme had a kinda strange seperation of the pieces, the parts for the control center and the shuttle are in seperate little boxes, and the others are in polybags with the models printed on them'
p16643
aS" Also seperate instructions for each step: A general overview: We got 3 lovely minifigs here, from left to right the control engineer, the mechanic and the astronaut: The -i dont know the english word for it- testing-thing, the astronaut is being tested to hard nerves there The mechanics little car, on the back an extinguisher and a radio device is attached: the take-off station for the little shuttle with the shuttle itself on it: And without it: Tools, tools, tools! The shuttle as stand-alone: i think that would be fuel tanks, i like this little detail: And finally we have the controll room, would have been better with seats, but it's alright: A really sweet mid-sized set if you ask me, a few juniorized parts, but it fits perfectly with the set"
p16644
aS' The theme itself is also great, and i wish that TLG brings it back, i could see stunning sets with the quality city sets have right now!'
p16645
aS" you just bring memory's back i never had one of the space port sets, but i know that as a little boy i visited my toy store and kept on looking to the boxes"
p16646
aS' on BL those sets cost too much for what ist worth today  really, TLC should bring this theme back! Space port ON!'
p16647
aS" In the catalog images I thougt that the base was on a 16'16 baseplate    I have some sets of space-port and like them, but I would want real town sets in 1999  "

p16715
aS" Wow 59,99EUr is a LOT of money!! What country do you live in??? Here it costed me 46EUR, so quite a price difference!!! IMO the set's certainly NOT worth that much money! Reki"
p16716
aS' UPDATE: I WILL BE MERGING REVIEWS AS THEY GO IDLE, THIS IS NOW THE DINO ATTACK REVIEW THREAD "What, Jay\'s not doing Viking reviews!?" Nope, I think Christopher110 took care of those just fine'
p16717
aS" Instead, I have brought you what is most possibly the HIGHEST-ANTICIPATED set of the year (;) :D) - the T1 Typhoon  And I gotta say - Dinos apart, it's actually really cool"
p16718
aS" The Dinos Let's get the worst over with  Yes  Those are ALL the parts in that 'dino' "
p16719
aS" The Figs They're possibly the best part of the entire set, all in all  Nice new head, although the glasses limit its usability  I am in LOVE with the head on that fig"
p16720
aS" It's perfect for any number of figures - a good 'scarred hero' face has always been on my want list  I'm turning him into my Viking warlord after I post this review  Again, a new head"
p16721
aS' Great stubbly beard thing going on  My second-favorite head of the lot  Great for warriors, especially with helms'
p16722
aS" The torsos are fantastic for special forces figures, if anyone's planning to do something like that  Not TOO fond of the lime green on there, but it's still extremely usable"
p16723
aS' This is actually a really cool machine gun  I like it  I think this would be a good point to note that ALL designs you see - outside the figures and dinos - are stickers'
p16724
aS" That means a crapload of stickers  If you can't stand stickers at all in a set, don't buy this "
p16725
aS" The Copter This is one BIGASS copter  The photos really don't do the size justice  Lower cockpit with cool computer  Too bad it's a sticker, although I'll definitely leave this one on"
p16726
aS" Upper cockpit with cool computer  See above  Awesome gatling gun  Yes, even the TECHNIC BEAMS have stickers  I'm actually really fond of that little canister thing  I can see using it elsewhere"
p16727
aS" Yes - that's a sticker  The rope and hook  I forgot to mention it before, this set comes with two accessories besides the machine gun - binocs and one of those little things to slide down the rope"
p16728
aS" Also, the thing that 'extends' the rope turns  The other side, because they're slightly asymmetrical  One of my favorite stickers  The door says 'SURVIVAL EQUIPMENT'  It's on both sides"
p16729
aS' Definitely a keeper '
p16730
aS" The base of the propeller  It wobbles a bit, but doesn't fall off  Very sturdy  Right side of the rear propeller  And the left (and better) side  The tail"
p16731
aS" It uses construction similar to the X-wing's nose, but on a larger scale  Definitely cool  A very neat part of the copter  The guns are constructed so that      "
p16732
aS' they turn without turning the cockpit  The interior is rather blase, though '
p16733
aS' Another of my favorite parts - landing gear  This is the front section      and it retracts! Unlike most ships with landing gear, this does NOT retract without effort (coughXWINGcough)  Very sleek'
p16734
aS' The back landing gear      and again, smooth retraction  Gotta love it  FINAL SCORE: 8'
p16735
aS"4/10 Parts: 8/10 Figs: 10/10 Dinos: 2/10 Copter: 9/10 Value: 7/10 Don't Buy If: - you can wait for Vikings - you don't like any set with stickers - you're not a space fan Buy If: - you're a space fan - you don't mind stickers/don't apply them - you're like to create cool figures Overall, I think it was worth the price, even at 605 pieces"

p16800
aS" They're rubbery, one piece, and the only things that remotely indicate that they're made by LEGO are the holes on the bottom of their feet"

aS" They're unrealistic to an extreme unmatched by even the previously reviewed Dinos, in that they are waaaaaaaay too thin, one is pink, and they're all grinning"
p16802
aS' Fig: One interesting thing to note is that this one has the same torso as the iron-masked dude in the chopper, not his own bare-arms torso  Pic for the sake of comparison'
p16803
aS" Now, I don't consider this fig as good as the others because the other heads are useful for Vikings and assorted castle-type people, but this has sunglasses"
p16804

p16805

p16807
aS' My question? When this is brought to Europe, will the steering wheel switch sides? ;) Seriously though, I love that little steering wheel piece more than I love taffy'
p16808
aS" And I'm a man who enjoys his taffy  Left side in its entirety      and the right side  View through the right side - no seat here  Could've done with another fig to fill the nonexistant seat, as well"
p16809
aS" The    weapon  Whatever it's called"
p16810
aS" This uses the same mechanism as the longboat (for those that don't have either, you snap the little sports stand thing, which hits the 'missile', which fires, and since there's nothing holding the technic beam up to that height any more, it drops down so that the next missile drops into place"
p16811
aS" Pretty cool, if unrealistic )  The two on the side do NOT fire, I think they're mainly there for 'extra ammo'  My biggest problem with this set  Open bed"
p16812
aS" This could have easily been remedied with a few plates  Interior opened  The Fire Hammer next to the T1  They look very cool together, don't they? You can also see my curio shelf  FINAL SCORE: 7"
p16813
aS"4/10 Dinos: 1/10 Fig: 8/10 (but that's just me) Hummer: 8 5/10 Parts: 9/10 I'm a harsh reviewer  I still think that if space/vehicles are your thing, you should buy this"
p16814
aS" However, if you're a bigger castle fan, or just like to get all sorts of LEGO, I would still suggest buying the Viking Catapult before this"
p16815

p16837
aS" I think it would been better if they would have made a mechanism there to bring it up, but it's okay: A few floors higher the sea is being observated and watched: On the ground level we have the medical station/warm-up room: The helicopter as stand-alone: All in all for me this is besides the police station THE city set of this year"

aS' It looks real neat to have it placed it in the midst of the deep blue sea, awaiting of any emergency rescue  Sometimes, I feel that this set can used it to merge with my Aqua Raiders sets'

aS' Paramedic Unit Set #: 6364 Year Released: 1980 Piece Count: 140 Minifigs: 2 List Price: unknown Well, let me first say that the English name, "Paramedic Unit" is not really a good name for this set'
p16986
aS' The function of a paramedic is to take a patient from an emergent situation, and deliver them to a hospital for treatment, generally an Emergency Room'
p16987
aS' This is a rather small "clinic" that I would imagine is more for family care than an Emergency Room'
p16988
aS' In addition, the car looks more like a doctor/nurse\'s car rather than an Ambulance or Emergency Response Vehicle  I would call this a "Clinic" rather than a Paramedic Unit'
p16989
aS" In any case, it's a great set, esp  for Table Towns that need medical services  What I like is that this set is small enough to place anywhere in your Lego City or Town"
p16990
aS' Starting with the instructions: Like all the classic town sets, alternate models are pictured, although i never tried building one: I like the little medical bus/van'
p16991
aS' The set includes two minifigs, that include a female Doctore or Nurse, and what I presume is a patient, based on the torsos: I really like the vehicle'
p16992
aS" It's a 4-stud wide two seater: The colors work well and I like the use of the white bar between the seats (and the 1x1 blue plates for lights)  Unfortunately, the emblems are stickers"
p16993
aS' Here\'s a shot of the neat little "Clinic": I like the use of the blinds for the exam room  It shows that Lego considered patient privacy when making this set'
p16994
aS' The interior includes an exam room, desk, and two blue swivel chairs: And a neat little eye chart: Although the letters L E G O would have made a nice touch'
p16995
aS' Lastly, a picture of the complete set: I must admit that I remember buying this set back in the 80s and I regreted it after taking it home'
p16996
aS' I\'m not sure what I didn\'t like about it (perhaps the "girl" back then), but now I really think it\'s a neat set  Well, there\'s a line of patients waiting to have their eyes checked  '

p17123
aS' I know of at least one other set that had that: the biggest Extreme Team set from 1998 had a vehicle with those pieces  Quote This tow truck is pretty useful'

aS" Indeed they have; they've appeared in 15 different sets, in total  They also have an identical width with the wide 2x2 wheels holder which is used on cars today"
p17137
aS" They are still excellent today, since retrofitting these suspension parts onto today's off-roader trucks won't give them weird proportions or any problems, and it looks perfect"
p17138
aS" Plus they are useful if you're lazy and don't feel like constructing the pin-suspension used in the early 90's for truck-trailers, altough stability probably will suffer "
p17139
aS" 4/5  I've had this set since I was young  Never understood why a tow truck needed to be an off-roader; maybe it was used to tow the other off-road vehicles"
p17140
aS' The suspension made the truck too tall to tow some cars, so I often took the hook out and use the truck as just an great off-road truck like 6672 (which also had the suspension wheels)'
p17141
aS" Other tow truck sets better filled their roles better, but that doesn't diminish this set at all  WhiteFang, on Jul 18 2008, 09:19 AM, said: I think it looks really out of proportion"
p17142
aS' No, for 25-odd years this vehicle was perfectly proportioned with all others in the town/city line'
p17143
aS" It's all these new 6 and 8 and 20 wide vehicles that are ignoring convention and making it look out of proportion"
p17144
aS' Granted speed racer sets are more of their own line, but 6660 is smaller than most of the cars produced in the last few years '
p17145
aS"Superb review of a great set!This is one of my favourite classic sets becouse of all these functions(engine,suspension)and it's great design with less than 100 pieces used( only 52 )!Congratulations for the review!I think that it's an outstanding set and surely worth 5 stars"

p17282

p17283

p17284
aS" They are all the same, however  See those two rubber parts? Those keep it in place when on surfaces like glass  Next come the large part of the legs  These are similar to the Assault Tiger's legs"
p17285
aS' The final result is very sturdy, thanks too    Notice the amazing classic space sticker? So we finally come down to this: The final result is amazing  It is sturdy, and has great detail'
p17286

p17444
aS': 6097 Name: Night Lord\'s Castle Number of minifigs: 7 Number of pieces: 598 Release Year: 1997 Let\'s start with a few box & instructions pictures: The inside od the box, with a few alternate models: The back, with another possibility how to assemble the 3 main parts: Instructions: Next, the 6 minifigs, starting with the witch on her black dragon: All 5 figures of the fright section: And the poor royal knight: We go on with the set itself, first a general overview (it\'s really high!): On the "first floor" there\'s a trap with which you can drop stones or other things down on unliked guests, the pot comes originally from fabuland i think, i love this thing: In the same floor there is a second trap, if you pull the bar, the door opens: We move on to the tower itself (did i mention it\'s really high?), on the ground level there\'s the place for the witch to do her spells: The wall is a secret door, which reveals a skeleton when turned over: on the next level there is this little thingy, first it only seems like a barrel'
p17445
aS"but when you pull the two 1x4 tiles on the back, a skull is being revealed, scary, huh : I don't really understand what this is for but i assume it's a telescope to watch and observate the dragons, i do find that a bit senseless since there haven't been telescopes in medieval times (or have there been): The back of the tower with the prison and the room for the treasure chest: The prison opened"
p17446
aS" It's secured with a chain, which i like very much cause you really can lock it with that: Treasure chest: From the highest peak we now go down to the very ground level, at the back of the castle there is another secret wall-door, flanked by two shields: At the back half of the inside there is the throne hall for the Bat Lord, with a nice warm fireplace in the back (this is, where the secret door is placed): The second half is pretty empty, except for these two baskets"
p17447
aS" i don't know exactly what they are for, but i ike the idea for using them as water places for the horses: One thing that might be a bit stupid is that 2 of the 4 side entrances do not have doors, so they are open and a guard would have to stand there the whole day"
p17448
aS" You can see it in his face he isn't very happy with that : That was my last review of the sets i got the last weeks, but i'm looking forward to make much more in the future"

aS" Overall this is a pretty good set, i don't know any other one with so much details and playability"
p17450
aS' The minus point is, as already said, that it is too open on the sides, but that can be solved easily with a bit of modding'
p17451
aS" Also i must say, this set isn't that much juniorized as many might have thought, though the design is a bit unconventional, but exactly that's what i like most about it"

p17455
aS' The Fright Knights are probably the closest you can get for an evil human Castle faction'
p17456
aS' As for the building itself, on the other hand I like the fact that it can be modified, but some of the design choices are just stupid'

p17458
aS" I guess for a smaller kid the play value is great, it's easily accessible and it looks sturdy enough, but to an AFOL, it's not much else than a source for bricks and figs, in my opinion"
p17459
aS' Oh, and they did have telescopes in the medieval times (the witch most probably uses it for astrology)'
p17460

aS" I like all the play features, and at the very least it's a great parts pack  Two things I'm confused about though"
p17463
aS" In this pic, is that dragon being used as a swing set? And I don't get why the area where the witch casts her spells on the second floor is green  Green in Castle means grass (or Forestmen  "
p17464
aS' ), and having grass on the second floor of a building is just weird'
p17465
aS" I understand that it's modular and thus it would make sense if it were placed on the ground, but dark grey would make just as much sense, and would look much better than the green there IMO"

p17480
aS" I enjoy the design of this castle much more even if the towers are taller simply because the design in the King's Castle Siege left builders with an empty space right in the courtyard without even a base plate! AND it's nearly impossible to get your hands in and play in the enclosed space (why would anyone unless you're simply posing figs, and even that was difficult)"
p17481
aS" This Castle instead, had a variety of trap doors and surprises, so despite the varied colors used here, it's not that hard to realize that the designers for this Castle really took time to think things out and tried to make the Castle enjoyable for the children that will play with it whereas our 2007 Castle was strictly built to give kids the impression of an enormous magnificant Castle with little to nothing inside"

aS' First impressions were of how much brick there was to the set, as well as really useful large structural elements'
p17543
aS" And to be honest, while perhaps a bit childish, there's no doubt the style of the minifigs is kinda cute and useful for customs"
p17544
aS' It was really enjoyable building this set, and the scale is impressive when built, empty spaces notwithstanding (but hey, Lego has always had buildings with no back, etc'
p17545
aS' - just use your imagination and enjoy the access to playspace offered)  The traps etc'
p17546
aS' are neat and more like the kind of "action features" modern sets come with (I for one am in favour of these, for kids they are fun and I think for builders they give ideas cause they are often done with minimal parts or impact on the set design)'
p17547
aS" Anyways, needless to say my sister loved the set  Indeed she's currently rebuilding it for the second time  If I see it as cheap again, I will pick up one for myself"
p17548
aS' I got the first one at 30 incl postage I believe '
p17549
aS' Ahh    I remember how badly I wanted that set when it was new    oh well    Definitely one of the most original castles, if not THE most'
p17550
aS' I actually liked how the 1st floor was made into a throne room  The tower looks pretty impressive, too  Of course, the castle has a flagrant flaw -- the walls on the sides are open'
p17551
aS' I also think it lacks in the minifig count, though that is understandable for a castle with a dragon  Quote The Fright Knights are probably the closest you can get for an evil human Castle faction'
p17552

aS' I got a couple of the small sets from this line when it came out  Recently, I acquired several more from Bricklink because I just really love the way they look'
p17562
aS' This theme really had good intentions, but the execution was flawed  I hope one day Lego returns to a darker tone, but maybe next time it could be more Castlevania inspired'

aS" Fire Station Set #: 6382 Year Released: 1980/1981 Piece Count: 368 Minifigs: 4 List Price: approx  $20 Lego's third fire station was this little gem, 6382"
p17566
aS' The set offered new design elements not previously offered in previous sets  What really stands out for me is 1x3 car doors and torsos with printed designs'
p17567
aS' A decal was used for the large sign on the building and the #1 on the hood of one of the vehicles'
p17568
aS' I think this was also the first set to offer the sliding garage mechanism, a feature that added a great amount of realism and playability'
p17569
aS' The set also included two blue doors and the new fire hose with pre-connected faucet/spicket  Getting on to the pictures'
p17570
aS' I saved the cover of the box for this set but lost the instructions over the years  I was able to download some instructions from the web'
p17571
aS" Here's a shot of the box cover: And the back of the box: The set includes four figs, three of which are fireman, and a lady who can serve as a dispatcher"
p17572
aS' As mentioned above, the torsos are printed on: My favorite of the two vehicles included, I love the design of Fire Engine #1: I always loved the fire hoses included in this set'
p17573
aS' No string to have to tie or freyed ends: Engine #2 is this much larger engine with ladder'
p17574
aS' I like how it contains an oxygen tank and fire axe: On the other side of the engine are two shutter doors that reveal the hose and ladder controls'
p17575
aS' These are stickers: The ladder is much wider than previous Lego ladders and extends a good length: I like the baseplate of this set which has the numbers ONE and TWO marking each garage: The building is simple but has a nice design'
p17576
aS' I love the sliding garage doors: NOTE: Notice the two windows of the 2nd floor  The actual set should have blinds on these windows'
p17577
aS" I've lost one of the stickered windows, so placed the single blinded window on the 1st floor  Each of the two sides of the garages are the same"
p17578
aS" Here's a shot of the right side: On the first floor is the dispatch area and a classic blue Space computer: The 2nd floor has a bed and a chair: Here's a shot of the entire backside: And lastly, a shot of the entire station: This set is one of my favorite fire stations that offers a great amount of playability"
p17579
aS' Hope you enjoyed the review '
p17580
aS' This is a great set and a great review - Thanks for doing these! I remember my brother getting this set (I got the police station 6384 on the same day)'

p17742
aS' Both of them wear the standard fire fighter outfit that is present in almost all Fire Station sets in Classic Town  The torso is very nice and formal, and looks real impressive onto them'
p17743
aS' I love the buttons on them  Furthermore, these white helmets are a symbol to the world of Fire Fighting  These are the people whom save lives by risking their own lives in dangerous situations'

aS' Water Hose compartment The water hose is a string that is stored in the front  It can be rolled out, and the fire fighters are able to use it without much difficulty'

p17749

p17755

aS' This is a very good way to adjust the height  Oh, and I forget to mention that there are 2 storage compartments for the fighters to place their equipments behind  Quite easy to access'

aS' 7676: Republic Attack Gunship Number of Pieces: 1034 Number of Minifigs: 5 Price: 119 99 USD Brickset Hey everyone, I just got the RGS yesterday at TRU after I came home from camp'
p18070
aS" I saw all of the topics that I missed, and noticed a mini-review and a review with one pic, so I thought I'd make a huge, shiny new review that has lots of pictures and all of the requirements of KimT's index"
p18071
aS' NOTE: I did not apply any stickers to it, as a personal liking'
p18072
aS' So, lets start by looking at the box: A shiny, clean, and futuristic box, quite different from the other Star Wars box designs before this'
p18073
aS' There was so much Clone Wars merchandise with this font and design in the huge display at the front of my local Toys r Us store, and not just LEGO  It so beautiful, with the white and sky blue  '
p18074
aS' anyways, for some reason, the boxes of the new Clone Wars sets seemed more shiny than usual'
p18075
aS" Maybe it's because they were just shipped, but once you pick up the boxes, they will feel really good in your hands, despite the fact that only about half of the space in the boxes are used  "
p18076
aS' The back of the box: The back shows all of the main features of the set, plus pictures of the three other Clone Wars sets meant to be released alongside this one (although I did spot the Twilight and Homing Spider Droid, which were supposed to be released in September or October)'
p18077
aS' So, on to the Gunship: Built straight from the bags  It took me about 4 1/2 hours, with breaks  It has an overall great design, but somewhat fragile, especially when building it'
p18078
aS' The cockpits always fall apart when opened, as well as the bubbles on the wings (which I will get into more later)  The color scheme is very well done'
p18079
aS" You can always find the piece you're looking for thanks to the color diversity: Red, Dark Red, Lime Green (ooh!), Blue, Black, Tan, Light Bley, Dark Grey, Yellow and White"
p18080
aS' Also, split down the middle vertically, the ship is almost all symmetrical  Front: Side: Now, lets start with the many features that this set is hiding  The front has lots of lime green, a rare color'
p18081
aS' But more importantly:    a rotating gun is found on each side  They rotate in a pretty wide range, although fragile  Cockpits: There are two main cockpits, right next to each other'
p18082
aS' Not very detailed, and are the same  And for some reason, the whole cockpit element flips up to reveal:    nothing  Just the skeleton of the ship'
p18083
aS" Probe droid storage: Above the cockpit lies a plate that can be flipped up to reveal a storage area that holds: Two of these probe droids  At least, that's what I think they are"
p18084
aS' Hull: In this pic, two features are hidden  Mobile Command Center: The first of the two is a Mobile Command Center, but essentially just a hover chair'
p18085
aS' It is found by flipping up the two panels on either side of the hull  Bacta Tank: The second is the bacta tank found by just sliding it out of the storage area behind the MCC'
p18086
aS' One half of the tank opens:    so a minifigure can go inside and heal his/her wounds obtained in battle  Cargo hold: Now, this is probably the main feature for this set'
p18087
aS' The two sliding doors (two on each side) slide open thanks to a clever Technic mechanism  Not much in here, just a gun holder and a place where the passengers wait to be dropped off in battle'
p18088
aS' Speeder Bike: I guess you guys saw it, the speeder bike  It is found by opening the rear flap  The bike is very cleverly designed by using a brown trike body'
p18089
aS" It's only a few centimeters shorter than the bike found in the Clone Battle Pack  Rear gun: Just a gun similar to the front ones"
p18090
aS' Engines: Huge engines (or are they cannons?) that are really fun to build  They really give that cartoon feel to this set  Missiles: In between the engines are two sets of four flick-fire missiles'
p18091
aS' Bubble cockpits: There is one bubble cockpit on each wing that supposedly control the turrets at the front  Very fragile'
p18092
aS" Storage containers: Two storage containers on each side hold the clone accessories  But, I wouldn't recommend putting them in there, because the antennae can fall out, or you might forget about them"
p18093
aS" Sticker Sheet: The Dreaded Sticker Sheet (DSS) has all of the stickers you need for this set  Unfortunately, mine was crunched up  I don't like stickers much anyways, but I might still apply some"
p18094
aS" Note the Republic symbol stickers, why couldn't TLG just use that printed piece from a few years back? Also, you get to choose between a bird-rat thing or a sleeping Twi'elk as your hull decal"
p18095
aS" What they're for, I don't know, looks like the movie or show will explain it though  Minifigs: Finally, the five minifigs of this set"
p18096
aS' They are all great figs, including: Commander Cody: Amazing, especially with the gear  The orange is nice, but I thought he was yellow  Clone Trooper: Again, amazing'
p18097
aS' The gear is great, and the new helmet and torso are great! All of the clones in the Clone Wars line have the same heads  Also, you can see the flesh beneath the helmet'
p18098
aS' Asaaj Ventress: Not so happy about this one  The torso and dark blue legs are cool, but the dress is pretty ugly'
p18099
aS' The head is alright, but could do without the cartoon-y face (yeah I know, its from a cartoon)  Also has purple markings on back of head  Obi-Wan Kenobi: Pretty cool, besides the face'
p18100
aS" Cool hair and torso, though  Plo Koon: Beautiful! The true gem of this set, in my opinion  The head is the same material as Kit Fisto's"
p18101
aS" And the tosro is awesome, good for making a custom Ki-Adi Mundi  Well, that's about it, here is the    FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, very fun and easy, should take the seasoned builder about 4 hours"
p18102
aS" Somewhat fragile  Playability: 9 5/10, Lots of fun features, although some can break easily  Swooshability: 3/10, I wouldn't recommend flying it around much, as you can barely pick it up safely"
p18103
aS' But with two hands gripping the bottom firmly, it can be moved around, but not spun or swooshed, etc'
p18104
aS' Minifigs: 8/10, all very great figs, especially Plo Koon, but could have included more clone troopers  Design: 7 5/10, some excellent ideas included in here, although some spots are very fragile'
p18105
aS' Price: 7/10: Should have been only 100 USD if not for the new molds  Plus, at TRU, it was 130 USD  Overall score: 8'
p18106
aS'5/10, a great set to have for your star wars/ clone wars collection, with some flaws  Save up for this one  So, how did you like my review? Your feedback is much appreciated! JimButcher, out'

p18246
aS' We had a fantastic time and it gave me the chance to pick up some of the new Castle sets and battlepacks I was really impressed by the sets I bought and decided to do my first review  '
p18247
aS' let battle commence! Set name: Tower Raid Set number: 7037 Price GBP: 19'
p18248
aS"99 Pieces: 364 The Models Here's a shot of the complete set: The set is made up of two models, the Crown Knight's tower and the Orc's siege tower"
p18249
aS" Let's start with the Crown Knight's tower: A knight readies himself for battle! My favourite model from the set, the wicked Orc's siege tower: Please note that for the purposes of display I mounted the Orc's banner onto a small cone set on the top platform of the siege tower"
p18250
aS" This doesn't come with the set but saves any Orcs having to hold onto it all he time! There are other areas it can be placed without using extra parts"
p18251
aS' Features Both models look great and have excellent features'
p18252
aS" The set as a whole has great playability and seems to have been concieved with a storyline: the Crown Knight's have a captured Orc within the walls of their tower so the Orc army has been sent out to recover him"
p18253
aS" or are they merely after the gold the knights keep horded away?! The Orc's siege tower has a powerful ram - spring-loaded by the simple arrangement of an elastic band - so pulling it back sends it flying out the front, knocking down the wall on the side of the knight's tower"
p18254
aS"      and releasing the captive Orc! The floor panels inside the prison are laid over a lip on the inside of the collapsible wall, so fall in when they're not supported"
p18255
aS" There's a string at the rear for extending the boarding ramp      "
p18256
aS'and letting a fearsome Orc warrior charge across! Flick-fire action! The battle heats up as the Orcs close in! The Minifigures The Crown Knights: I really like the Crown Knights'
p18257
aS" They're metallic helmets look great and they come with nice accessories"
p18258
aS" The archer has a double printed head with a frightened look on the other side too! I'm not surprised, I'd be frightened when staring over the ramparts at these  "
p18259
aS' The Orcs: These guys really do look the part, worthy advesaries to the Crown Knights! The details are superb: the printed elements, weapons and helmets, all set the Orcs aside on the battlefield'
p18260
aS" The set comes with a great new molded armour neckpiece too  The mighty Orc leader looks wicked in his full battlegear! Overview There's so much to this set it's hard not to be impressed"
p18261
aS" The Orc's siege engine is a thing of beauty (or terror!) and would look great on any battlefield  The Crown Knight's tower although basic, looks good and has great playability"
p18262
aS" I'm a big fan of the new Castle knights and fantasy minifigures and the inclusion of five of them is just enough for this set and as a booster to any army  At 19"
p18263
aS'99 in the UK this set is well worth the money for content and quality'
p18264
aS" I'd highly recommmend this set as a must-have purchase for anyone A final shot of the siege tower with a host of Orcs ready for battle: I hope you enjoyed my review, I'll be posting my next one for 7040 Dwarves Mine Defender soon!"
p18265
aS' I got this set in the spring during my "buy every new Castle set available"-season  Granted, I couldn\'t afford all of them, but I do have most of them now'
p18266
aS' Anyway, I love the action elements to this set, and the siege tower really does look wicked'
p18267
aS" I'd like to attach the Crownie tower to the King's Castle to see how it fits, but I unfortunately don't own that set (yet)"
p18268
aS" I also love the turning head of the soldier, and I've used it in my Princess Quest-comic as well, along with the turning head of the princess"
p18269
aS' The Troll Leader brings good variety to the army of trolls, but they still could use another face type and more torso options'
p18270
aS" It's a nice review, in any case, although the set pretty much speaks for itself "
p18271
aS" Hey, good review and good photos  I also got this set just recently, and I wasn't very enthusiastic about it at the beginning, but after I built it I could appreciate it"
p18272
aS" The siege engine is very nice, but my complaint has do with the proportions of the knight's tower in respect to the trolls' machine - it's a bit smaller, and less bulkier"
p18273
aS" That complaint has to go with some other sets too  For example the troll warship is really humongous - it feels like it can load the evil wizard's tower and sail off"
p18274
aS' Other than that - a good set, I like it, 4/5 from me '
p18275
aS' Excellent review and your pictures are very good, I look forward to seeing more review'

p18316
aS" However, this is also the joy of LEGO as one can simply purchase a few bricks and build their own walls and/or expand the tower's size (or even attach it to a castle)"

aS' Of course, this increases the price of the set, but considering how cheap bricks are on BrickLink, Tower Raid is still a very good value  I hope you continue doing reviews, pedro '

aS'00 A basic review of 7624 (my apologies for the blurry and grainy pictures my camera is acting up ): The build is nothing speicial on to the figs Indiana Jones, Mutt Williams and Irina Spalkoi, nice array of minifigs although I think they should have included a russian soldier or two'

The First Step: Seccond Step: More Steps Of The Main Body: The Wing Assembly: (Sorry for the blur) Attached: Opposite Wing: Both Attached: Rear Engine Build: The Staffs"
p18398
aS' I have mine set up differently than in the instructions  I put one cone over the hump on one end of the staff, and the other in the original spot'
p18399
aS' Then, to load them onto the fighter, all you do is push the original placed cone down and put it right in'
p18400
aS' This way, the staff looks better and it works the same! See? It slides right in: Skeletal parts of sides attached: Close Up: Bottom: Both Wings Attached: Hidden Missle Launcher: Raised Up: Another Shot: Staffs Attached: Complete: Side Panel: Side Pods: Complete: Swooshable!: Finished!: Time to complete: >2hrs'
p18401
aS' Okay, Overall rating time! PRICE: 9/10- Could have been 40 00 USD, but due to new molds, this is understandable  PARTS: 9/10- Could have hade more Dark Red, but thats IMO'
p18402
aS' Plus, I love Dark Red! BUILD TIME: 8/10- I took my time on this and enjoyed the techniques the designers intricated  Also, taking pics added to the time quite a bit'
p18403
aS" PLAYABILITY: 7/10- The main playability functions are the missle launchers in the back and the sliding cockpit  My only gripe with these is they don't set right with the other slopes on the top"
p18404
aS' Also, the inside of the cockpit is easily modded for regular size minifigs'
p18405
aS' Just pop a handlebar piece in the already provided arm in the cockpit and bam, your favorite figs can have a ride! It also helps keep the Magnaguards in place if they hold it'
p18406
aS' MINIFIGS: 10/10- IMO, the new molds are great! The only downfall is the right arm on both is less moveable due to the hard plastic turban-thing connected to the head'
p18407
aS" SWOOSHABILITY: 9/10- The starfighter is pretty sleek, and very swooshable! DESIGN: 9/10- The most important aspect, and this one's a winner! It's only a nine because it needs to have smoother edges in a few spots, but they are easily MODable"

aS' Dino Attack quad for me'
p18539
aS" No, this isn't because I own it and not the other one, but because I think just about everything is better in it - the design is better, the colors are cooler, and it has a better figure"
p18540
aS" I don't like the figure in the coast guard quad at all - but since it was from World City, I'm not suprised  I also kinda like the dino, actually"
p18541
aS" It's flexible and fits in with the previous dinos a lot better than the cruddy bigger ones with bright red, yellow, and green highlights "
p18542
aS' ooooooh! this is a very hard choice,i like this new coast guard theme but i LOVED! Dino Attack The Dino Attack set has a weird looking gun,but IMO the Coast Guard set looks        '

aS' Price: 569 kr Minifigs: 2 Pieces: 592 Stickers: 9 (My sticker sheet wasnt curled up) Overview: Before I start I will apologize for the bad quality of the pictures'
p18551
aS' It is getting dark here right now, so some of the pictures are a bit dark  1) Minifigs: The set comes with two of the new Clone Wars clone troopers, which in my opinion are pretty cool'
p18552
aS' It also comes with two short blasters and a bag of clone accessories'
p18553
aS' Figs with helmets: Figs without helmets: 2) The tank: This thing is HUGE (25cm long and 22cm wide), and far oversized in my opinion, but looks great nonetheless'
p18554
aS' I very much like the white and dark red color scheme, mixed with a bit of lime green (even though there is no lime green bricks ;) )'
p18555
aS' Left side: Right side: Back side: Both of the wings contain a hidden compartment to store the blasters and a part that rotates to reveal three flickfire missiles'
p18556
aS' The front opens up as well to reveal the engine  The side guns and the gun on the top rotate'
p18557
aS' Inside the cockpit is space for two figs; one seated in front of two computer screens and one placed in a moveable seat, which moves up and down, allowing the fig to pop up the top hatch and staying hidden while the hatch is closed'
p18558
aS' This function is triggered by opening the backdoor  Hidden compartment and missiles: Engine: Top hatch (open/closed): Interior: 3) Rating: Build: 9/10 Not much to say here'
p18559
aS' Minifigs: 7/10 An extra fig or two would have been great; eventually a Jedi or a commando  Design: 8/10 This only looses a couple of points for being oversized, but its a great looking model'
p18560
aS' Parts: 10/10 At 592 parts, this is one of the CW sets with the best parts/price ratio  Price: 8/10 Sure this thing is great, but I think its overpriced at 569 kr  (approx  $120)'
p18561
aS' When build it feels more like a 450 kr  Set  Final verdict: 9/10 Despite some flaws this thing is definitely recommended, and it looks great on your shelf, too ;)'

aS' We had a lot of fun celebrating a bag-build at our event using the 8150 ZX Turbo of that theme so I knew what would expect me with this "extended" set'
p18779
aS' Price: normal 49,99 now 24,99 (well I paid 34,99 in a Lego store but thats another story  '
p18780
aS') Bricks: 796 Minifigs: - Hey, this is tiny turbos, stupid! Stickers: Dont ask (or read further) The open box reveals seven polybags, some with more smaller polybags inside, the instruction booklet, 2 ramps and the sticker sheet'
p18781
aS' Of course I put all of the bags on the table and not on the floor Hey, TLC didnt print this on the first page of the building instructions! And you wont see any piece callouts as well'
p18782
aS' On the other hand this is not adifficult build, so why show them? Still there is an inventory list of all bricks at the end of the instructions'
p18783
aS' Note the giant sticker sheet! We all now the DSS, but that is a new kind of extra super large sticker sheet  It holds 82 stickers! More to that later on  The build is quite basic'
p18784
aS' The only non-conventional parts of the build were the two slammers  And the most annoying part was fiddling the rubber band of the holder without destroying it'
p18785
aS' Bag 1: Easy beginning: Building the lime car, the limo and the two slammers  Nothing exciting about the lime car, but the limo was neat'
p18786
aS' Its an 18 studs long car! The normal racers are abot 10 studs long  Nice way to put the horns on the back! The slammers  Mmmmh  Nice invention if they would actually DO something'
p18787
aS' They are supposed to give the Tubros a kick in the butt to speed them up, but the result is a 80 cm long "run" and thats it  I had expected more acceleration from the slammers'
p18788
aS' But its also fun to play with the cars without slamming them  Bag 2: Convoy time: The tow truck and the fuel truck The tow truck is a great idea and a good addition to the set'
p18789
aS' The cars are supposed to crash - how do they get back home? Well, heres the answer  Quite american layout of the truck and its very well done: Horns, 5 flashing lights and a right color choice'
p18790
aS' You can move the arm up and down and pull out the hook  Note the metallic silver antennae  The fuel tank has got a "secret" function  It may break on the middle of the trailer'
p18791
aS' Therefore it has a hinge build in the bottom  City fire mayhem! And theres no fire engine    Bag 3: Long, longer, how long can a "tiny" truck be? The pipe truck, an unexpected buggy and the red racer'
p18792
aS' 36+ studs long: The pipe truck breaks every convention  The cabin is almost the same like the tow truck and the fuel truck and that is the good part of it'
p18793
aS' The trailer has to carry pipes and is functional as well as it can commute sidewarts  It looks quite unrealistic as well and you cannot drive this beast on tiny roads  Good for another crash'
p18794
aS' But there are more cars in this bag  Now this was a surprise: A buggy? This is the only 6(+)-wide car, but just because the wheels are large  Monster truck madness? I dont care for those cars'
p18795
aS' Personally a disappointment, I would have preferred another racer  + for variety though  Did I say another racer? Here we are: The red devil  Great looking, a real fast shape and red'
p18796
aS' The best racer in this set  Vrooommm! This is the most "played with" car of the set  (Not only from me )  As you may have noticed I didnt put any stickers so far'
p18797
aS' I dont like stickers especially when placed over two or more bricks! And here you are supposed to do it several times'
p18798
aS' Of course the cars look better with stickers on, but they are also great without stickers  Only the fuel truck looks boring without'
p18799
aS' My sons didnt know there were supposed to be stickers and they didnt ask for them'
p18800
aS' So everything is allright! Heres a closeup of the sticker sheet (did I already mention it was 82 stickers? ): The only exception I made using sticker was for bag 4: Bag 4: You go here? You pay! The highway toll booth'
p18801
aS' The only immobile part of the set, but great to brake though the barriers'
p18802
aS' That is fun! I only put on stickers on 2x2 plates where I had the idea to use those plates further on on different other MOCs  This looks a bit boring without the other stickers I admit'
p18803
aS' But still no cut off to the playability! There are also two ramps belonging to the set  These only make sense if you are able to speed up the racers with the slammers and hit the ramps correctly'
p18804
aS' I had problems with that, so they are on the shelves now    Could be a lot fun making a contest though'
p18805
aS' Like this (picture of the inventories frontpage) All cars put together: The usual leftovers: All in all this is a great set to call ones own! I did not regret buying it, especially when it was 50% off! Even normal price would not have been too much'
p18806
aS' Build: Great for smaller children, boring to AFOLs: 5/10 Special bricks/colors: None, all basics: 3/10 Design: I love the tiny turbos size and design: 9/10 Playability: -1 because of the slammers, another -1 because no minifig-scale'
p18807
aS' But that is not the intention of the set: still 9/10 Price/piece ratio: Dang! Its not on sale any more  But if you hurry you could still grab one in the Lego stores  10/10 All in all: 8'
p18808
aS'5/10 and a clear recommendation! It was and still is a set to play with your children'
p18809
aS' The size fits perfectly to Matchbox cars and that was exactly what my younger son did: Can you find all of the cars included in the set? P S'
p18810
aS': After buying this set I won an ebay auction with another tiny turbos set - 8135 bridge chase  This is even more fun! I will soon care for a review with some never seen photo-tricks as well'
p18811
aS' Stay tuned! Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 07:02 PM  Indexed'
p18812
aS'This set was on my wanted list for a long time and the sales at S@H came just in time I also loved the set, and like you only put the stickers on the toll both (it looks great on a town layout with almost no modifications)'
p18813
aS" The racers are great  The trucks and the limo are the best in my oppinion  The sticker sheet is huge, but I've seen bigger"
p18814
aS' Stickers over multiple pieces are the worst The slammers are ok, but not great'
p18815
aS' I played with my 4 years old son and we tryed to do what shows in the box (the cars passing the toll, jumping the ramps and crashing the trucks) but it is very difficult to get it right'
p18816
aS' But the crashes are very fun '

aS" Thanks for the review  I'll definately get this set sooner or later  IMO the Tiny Turbos are awesome"

p18833
aS' To get time going, I built the models and made this small review for you to enjoy (or hate) High resolution pics can be found here when public  Set# 4994 Title: Fierce Creatures Price: 9 99 EURO / 12'
p18834
aS'99 USD Pieces: 193 Minifigs: 0 The Box: The box looks awesome! It has some great animations of the 3 models in the instruction'
p18835
aS' The rear of the box shows some nice up-close-and-personal drawings of each model  I think it works better having the models drawn instead of a mere photo of them'
p18836
aS' Somehow it allows the great colour-scheme to really show  The Instructions: The instruction is easy to follow and shows which pieces are used in each building step'
p18837
aS' That makes it all a lot easier, especially with so many small pieces as in this set'
p18838
aS' The bricks are divided into 3 polybags and the instruction is a fine small book, which can be easily stored along the rest of your ever-growing amount of booklets and pamphlets printed by TLG'
p18839
aS' The models: Model 1 is a spider and its nasty  The 2x2 modified brick with the hole would allow one to hang it from a string'
p18840
aS' This beast is sure to give you several nightmares, were it hanging from a string in your bedroom'
p18841
aS'  So I wouldnt do that (plus the fact that my wife threw away the box and ordered me to take the spider apart when she saw it  Shes an arachnophobian and does not take spiders lightly)'
p18842
aS' It looks real, in a brickish-non-real-way  Model 2 is a snake  Theres not much to say other than the head is awesomely designed and the rest is bad'
p18843
aS' The body is poorly designed and does not live up to the coolness of the head  Build the head, ignore the rest  Model 3 is a flying scorpion or something'
p18844
aS' Not as realistic as the spider, but still a great model with a cool head  The tail is a bit poorly designed, but itll do and it does offer some good ideas on how to use bricks'
p18845
aS' All in All Verdicts: This is an ok Creator set  It holds a lot of fine pieces and the models are an ok inspiration  Given its size, its an ok set  But its nothing more than that'
p18846
aS' Ill give it an average score  I enjoyed building the models and fumbling with the bricks in the shade during a siesta on my vacation'
p18847
aS' And thats what it is, an enjoyable build and a little inspiration on a hot day with a Erdinger Dunkel Weissbier in my other hand  KimT Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 06:29 PM  Indexed'

tp18895
Rp18896
aS' Skipper, thanks for doing up all these SW Reviews  It certainly had given me some valuable insights on these sets especially on the Snowspeeder  It kind of making me regret to pass off this set'
p18897
aS' However, I had bought the hoth base instead but had never built it'
p18898
aS' I am just wondering if the snowspeeder had any difference? Keep up the good work and always strive your best to make each upcoming review a better one '
p18899
aS" There isn't much difference apart form it has stickers on and is grey  Also the guns and tow cable gun are different as well as the engines"
p18900
aS' But if you look at pictures of the Hoth base speeder not to much is noticeable '
p18901
aS" I have mixed feelings about this set  It's one of the sets that sent my into a dark age (the birth of my son contributed heavily)"
p18902
aS' When I first saw this set I was convinced that the earlier Snowspeeder (7130) was superior in every way  I liked the look of the 7130 version better, I liked the coloration of it better'
p18903
aS' The turret was better (it used a webbed 6 x 6 dish)  After seeing this review, I realize I was wrong on some accounts  The cockpit is much more movie accurate'
p18904
aS' The 7130 version had two separate compartments  This version also came with a tow cable, something that was lacking from the previous set'
p18905
aS' While I still am unimpressed with the overall look of this set, it is much less blocky, which is always a good thing  Overall, I still prefer 7130 to the 4500 version'
p18906
aS" But the 4500 isn't nearly as bad as I first assumed, and I regret never buying one of these when I had my chance "
p18907
aS' Great review! I bought this set when it came out but sold it a couple years later for some extra cash'
p18908
aS' I have no regrets selling this one, as I was never really impressed with it (different story for the 4483 AT-AT - oh how I wish I still had that one)'
p18909
aS' The snowspeeder was alright, just didn\'t have any sort of "wow" factor to it  The best part of the set is probably the Rebel Trooper'
p18910
aS" Looking at the last photo in your review, looks like you're about to have a major battle in your hallway"
p18911
aS" Apart from the snowspeeder & motorized AT-AT, I see the ARC-170 Fighter, Grievous's starfighter, and is that a podracer I see -- and what is the set with the treads? It's not Star Wars, but looks like a pretty cool set (maybe a Mission Mars vehicle)"
p18912
aS" Podracer not sure where you got that from (I didn't have them out)? The set with treads is a Dino 2010 thing which fits in well after a bit of modding"
p18913
aS' Also there are some of the old EXO-Force sets out there like the Fire Vulture because I always saw them fitting well with Star Wars '
p18914
aS"Skipper 24, on Aug 4 2008, 12:52 PM, said: Podracer not sure where you got that from (I didn't have them out)? I noticed the minifig between the Grievous starfighter & the mod-Dino2010 vehicle and it looked like a little person sitting in the pod of his podracer"

aS' Guess my eyes are playing tricks on me -- my eyesight is shot & my wife keeps pushing me to go visit the optometrist '
p18916
aS" Nope there is a guy sitting there  He's there because on Dine 2010 there were no guns like on Dino attack, so so I made a big gun like on the Dino attack set"

aS' Thanks for the review KimT  I gave this "Above Average"  I believe I had this one, but it was so long ago  '
p19234
aS' I\'m still a bit freaked out by the yellow ones! When I emerged from my Dark Ages I kept thinking "gee, I miss the people packs", but now that I have over 500 mini-figures I don\'t feel that way anymore'
p19235
aS' Even so, I wish they would re-release some of the classic old ones '
p19236
aS' I voted "above average" as well, but back in 1983, I would have probably gone much lower  Sadly, I wasn\'t as interested in minifigs at the time'
p19237
aS' I appreciated the ones I had, but I really just wanted ships or bases, and would have gladly passed this by for something with one or two figures and a small moon rover'
p19238
aS' I skipped all of the classic minifig sets, space, castle and town  It was only upon coming out of my dark ages that I went minifig crazy  For me, this is above average because of the accessories'
p19239
aS" Without them, it's an average set  With a small brick built droid or a rover, it would be outstanding"
p19240
aS" That said, I'd buy at least 10 copies now, though I'd rather have a 4 figure set with one of each colour including blue  I never had blue back then  I think Castle lured me away"
p19241
aS' Thanks for an interesting review! It gives me a chance to further explore why I changed from ship/set to minifig fan and bore all of EB with it '
p19242
aS" An ancient set revived from KimT's collection! Just take a look at the box art  This is one classic space minifig pack which deserve high rating, and I gave it above average"
p19243
aS' I never had any of these classic space figs before  If TLG could ever released this again, I am pretty sure I will grab multiple packs without a glimpse'
p19244
aS' You need to build your space agents/astronauts with a little bit of accessories added to explore the unknown space  I love this pack very much  Thanks for sharing!'
p19245
aS' I wonder why this set had no blue or black astronauts? Whatever the case, I always loved the small minifig sets that Lego released, as I could never get enough astronauts'
p19246
aS' My favorite was the set of Futuron astronauts  Why would the yellow astronauts freak you out, Sinner? Is it because they look nekkid? ;-)'
p19247
aS' Pretty nice set, but the newer minifig packs had greater variety in both the figures and equipment'

aS' 7674 V-19 Torrent Number of Pieces: 471 Number of Minifigs: 1 Price: 49'
p19301
aS'99 The V-19 Torrent starfighter was an assault fighter with exceptional speed and maneuverability used by the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars'
p19302
aS'It was a predecessor of the Alpha-3 Nimbus-class V-wing starfighter, in terms of purpose and usage  It first appeared in the Genndy Tartakovsky?s Clone wars 2D series'
p19303
aS' Basics Box front: The box art shows the torrent flying above Tatooine, with the new blue and white ?clone wars?? style packaging, Box back: The back shows some of the features of the set including the lifting mechanism and adverts for 7679 Republic Gunship, 7675 AT-TE and the 7673 MagnaGuard starfighter Inside the box, there are 2 instruction books, a very small DSS and 9 bags that are not numbered'
p19304
aS' Bags: Instruction books Random manual shot Parts list Book one is mainly the construction of the body and one of the engines, Book 2 is the other engine and the wings'
p19305
aS" For better pics of the manual look on lego's website  Sticker sheet: A very small sticker sheet is included, which includes 2 republic insignias and a nose sticker"
p19306
aS' Minifigure One minifigure is included, a clone pilot'
p19307
aS' The whole "OMG only one minifigure in this set" and "Its not movie accurate, i hate you TLC!!!11one2" has been beaten to death, so please don\'t make this review turn into that and to be honest i don\'t care because its an awesome figure'
p19308
aS' TLC have made the effort to print the life support device onto the chest plate so props to them'
p19309
aS' He has the "clone head" like the rest of the clones have in the CW releases, there are no extra clone bits apart from a long blaster, that\'s not included here'
p19310
aS' Interesting/other pieces Printed piece! Rare/unusual pieces: there are 2 pistons included, as well as 2 weird looking technic pieces that serve as the landing gear during the build'
p19311
aS" which might explain why the set is quite expensive, it musn't have been cheap to manufacture them"
p19312
aS' The build It starts off relatively simple, the first 16 steps is getting the basic shape of the cockpit and the mechanism to make the middle wing move up and down'
p19313
aS" After that the next few steps are getting the landing gear/wing folding device done, it's actually the same thing so when the wings move into attack mode the landing gear retracts"
p19314
aS' This is then locked into place by the white beams that form the basic shape of the fuselage  Up to step 46 is the fuselage, as well as fitting the hydraulics'
p19315
aS' This is what it looks like when the fuselage is complete'
p19316
aS' The cockpit is not "air tight", there\'s is quite a big gap Top: Bottom: The final few steps of book 1 is the construction of one of the engines, here it is attatched : The yellow bar is not permanent, its used to keep the white bit at the top from moving downwards'
p19317
aS" The steps are repeated in the second book so that both engines are now in On to the wings! First one attatched, The middle one is attached now: and finally the last one: It is now finished! The pieces that are left: So, you're probably wondering, how does it enter attack mode? well can you see this bar? push that bar to the center, and pick it up, the hydraulics move the central wing downwards as well as the side wings to enter attack mode: The outer wings have flickfire missiles on them, they obviously don't work, but it increases the playability of the set"
p19318
aS" The cockpit opens in a similar way to General Grevious's starfighter released last year, using a sliding mechanism For other pics see here : http://s25 photobuck  "
p19319
aS"eview/?start=20 and i'll be taking other requests for pics, maybe a video of it switching between modes  Build: 7/10 very symmetrical build, the mechanism to move the wings might annoy some people"
p19320
aS' Minifigs: 5/10 1 fig in a 50 set, however it is a starfighter Design: 9/10 very accurate to the source material, Lego have really made the effort to make the movement feature work'
p19321
aS" Parts: 8/10 lots of technic, white and dark red pieces Price: 7/10 could be slightly cheaper, Playability: 6 5/10 need to buy some enemy sets to get the most of it, flick fires don't work"

aS' Great review simonjedi -- I really like that you included lots of photos of your build  I put together my V19 Torrent last night, and I was surprised by how heavy the completed ship is'
p19362
aS" It has some real heft  Once it's finished, WOW! it is a really cool ship  I was disappointed that the central wing doesn't really lock into place once it flips down"
p19363
aS" It just kind of droops there, so I attached a technic pin to the locking arm so it could plug into the 2x4 brick that's on the underside of the starfighter (this brick can be seen in your photo of the bottom of the ship)"
p19364
aS" Overall, the build is one of the more confusing that I've seen (I had to dismantle and re-build the first engine after I realized I'd left out a piece) and I kept thinking of the poor 7-year-old that gets this set as his/her very first LEGO set ever"

aS' Access is provided by a plate which is connected to the platform with a few hinges'
p19453
aS" There are however two lamp posts, a timetable and a few chairs so if you don't like the platform you can still use these parts in a variety of other constructios"
p19454
aS' To end off I took a pic of the complete set (with extra wagon) and a friendly surprised train driver opening the door and greeting the camera man'
p19455
aS" Conclusion Being a '90s set, the train basically builds itself"
p19456
aS' The entire build cost me two hours and a half (I lost quite some time simply admiring the set) and was extremely straightforward with no suprises at all, but I need to admit it has its charm'
p19457
aS' The exterior is simply amazing  The sleekness of the design, the colours, it matches perfectly! I believe however that a width of 8 studs would be more to scale but 6 wide still looks amazing'
p19458
aS' The interior is somewhat simplistic but is easily moddeable with a few extra pieces  I basically bought the train as a parts pack'
p19459
aS' The standard set (three wagons) includes no less than 8 train doors with windows, 14 train windows, 4 smaller longer ones and 4 freight doors'
p19460
aS' The front and back of course count as unique pieces as well  One feature I am displeased with are the printed doors'
p19461
aS' I like printed pieces and while the blue-white-red stripe looks beautiful on the side the printed doors kind of limit MOCing capabilities to carriages with a stripe on the side'
p19462
aS' I considered simply removing the stripe but I found out I could just get normal grey ones from bricklink for a fair price'
p19463
aS' I am very pleased with the train but since you already know my opinion, feel free to tell us yours of this fabulous set! Edited by TheBrickster, 09 July 2009 - 01:51 PM'

aS' The great level of playability and detailing makes it a terrific model  Specifically, I was just noticing the details of the passenger car'

p19486
aS' The color scheme is the same one that Amtrak and many local subway systems use  I picked it up along with the club car expansion when they were re-released in 2001'
p19487
aS' I have made various modifications to mine, rearranging the car layouts and adding a second train motor into the rearmost car along with another set of lights, so that both ends light up'

aS' This is a great review of a great set, Hairy Ruben! I voted for Outstanding since the only thing you can say about this train set is that it is outstanding'
p19514
aS" It has been the best passenger train in all the time from Lego's beginning on until now  I bought the rereleased version of it in 2003 - and I really, really do not regret it! Klaus-Dieter"
p19515
aS' I also voted "Outstanding", for the simple reason that I\'ve owned this set for a long time, but for most of the time it\'s been an anonymous heap of bricks mixed with all the other bricks I have'
p19516
aS" So about a year ago I started rebuilding it, and it now sits proudly next to (also rebuilt) 2150 on my shelf  IMO; It's an excellent set, best of the 9V passenger trains, no doubt"
p19517
aS" And it combines the best of the 80's trains with that of the 90's - it's not some futuristic panorama-glassed low-slung train, but an honest, realistic-looking train that captures many of the features that passenger trains used to (and in some cases; still) have"

aS' The space in the front carriage is occupied by a cockpit (or whatever it is called in trains) and some space to store your cable connecting the front lights with the engine'
p19520
aS' I can imagine it must get quite cramped and dangerous for the minifig driver with all the cabling  Further back we have a quite random, weird looking engine'
p19521
aS' One part reminded me rather of a jet engine on a commercial airplane  The engine is accessible by means of the two side cargo doors'
p19522
aS' At the end of our first carriage we hit what looks like the train\'s restaurant, two tables and no chairs  There shouldn\'t be so much of the light cable in the front section or "cockpit'
p19523
aS'" Most of the cable should be in the central part of the train  Then it is not so crowded for the engine driver  I have never had a problem with the cable and the space available for it'
p19524
aS" The only problem I had was that the cable had a loose contact after some time  When the train went into a curve (can't remember if it was a left or right curve) the light went off"
p19525
aS' I have now got the same problem with the cable that I put into my Santa Fe Super Chief  Always when the engine turns into a right curve, the light goes off'
p19526
aS' My dad could repair the cable for the metroliner'
p19527
aS' Even though he is quite skilled at repairing electronic things, he found it very difficult to repair since there were no screws to open the electronic plate  It annoyed him a lot'
p19528
aS" So I've been asking myself if I should really bother him with a second cable with the same problem  The train set itself is outstanding (and that's what I voted for)"
p19529
aS" I only have the legend 10001, but it's 99% identical to 4558  I also have club car 4547  I don't have the legend club car 10002"

aS' The reason for this is I always had the choice between one big LEGO set or several small ones for Christmas when I was a child  I always went for several small ones'
p19531
aS' Metroliner 4558 would have been a big train set, but I really wanted a passenger car  So I bought 4547 with my savings without having the metroliner'

p19581
aS" My buddy CopMike would probably love to be the first to review this set, so I've dedicated my review comic to him: My rating Playability: 8/10 (You need to add some other sets and characters to really play with this set) Design: 9/10 (Great techniques and inclusion of rare parts, but loses a point for being an unrealistic size for a jeep) Price: 10/10 (Part of the BrickMaster package, it is a reasonable prize for an exclusive set and everything else that comes with the subscription) Overall: 9/10 (Great, but not perfect and definitely needs to be offered overseas"

aS" It could do with some replacements, but I haven't had the time, yet  The verdict: A fine little classic set  Not much more than that"
p19646
aS' It holds some useful bricks and worked fine as an "impulse" back then  The classic children\'s birthday presents during the early 80\'s  I got quite a few space and town sets back then'

p19651
aS' Usually it was either this set or 6844 The really nice thing about this set are the alternate builds  For the low price you got a nice range of parts and cool ideas what to build with them'

aS" Outback Amazon Crossing G'day Mates! Another fine review from the Legoland's Desert Down Under"
p19670
aS' This set makes for an excellent addition to your jungles, deserts, outbacks, or other wild and untamed places'
p19671
aS" Set #: 6490 Theme: Outback Year Released: 1997 Piece Count: 117 Minifigs: 1 List Price: $15 (USD) Starting with an image of the box, one can conclude that this doesn't look like the Amazon at all, but rather the Outback: On the back of the box are some great alternate models, including a creative idea for a crocodile zoo scene: The instructions have the same images on the front and back: The set comes with one Outback fig, a man dressed in green with a bright red cap - I call him the Crocodile Hunter"
p19672
aS' Also included in this set is a crocodile, some bones, a skull, backpack, pan, and a few extra trans  round 1x1s'
p19673
aS" The tools are pictured on the truck: Now here's a great desert/rugged terrain truck: Ready for some 4-wheel'n fun  I love the liftable top window/sun roof and the windshield"
p19674
aS' I like the use of these colored trans'
p19675
aS' blue pieces that contrast against the yellow, rather than hide like regular clear pieces: The truck has a few hooks/clips to attach a pick, rifle, antena, and camera'
p19676
aS' Also attached is a water/oil can and an extra tire that just rests in the back section: The front end of the truck has a great winch and hook to help the truck out of hard places: Working suspension helps the vehicle travel on rough terrain: The truck is just half the fun'
p19677
aS' This set also offers a nice bridge/creek bed for the truck to drive across: I like the use of six fence/ladder pieces for the bridge  The two in the center have double open sides'
p19678
aS" Here's the left side: And the right side with a single burp as a mountain/hill: I really like the use of the tan and brown baseplates representing desert and water"
p19679
aS" The complete set as the Crocodile Hunter tries to climb back into the truck after attaching the winch: Final Thoughts: I've always liked this little set"

p19793
aS' The extra piece is a TransYellow 1x1 round plate  According to Brickset and Peeron, the difference between box and polybag is the sticker "sheet"'
p19794
aS' You choose whether the nose is better with or without the sticker: I\'d say "with"  The judgement: it\'s cheap, it has a cool minifig with a cool head accessory and a nice torso'

aS' Emergency Evac Set #: 6445 Theme: Town Res-Q Year Released: 1998 Piece Count: 97 Minifigs: 1 List Price: $8 (USD) In 1998, Lego introduced a new theme called Res-Q'
p19942
aS' The theme was really a quasi-Coast Guard sub-theme of Classic Town  The theme included boats, helicopters, emergency vehicles, and even a water hovercraft'
p19943
aS' Most notable was the black and yellow color combination that predominated the sets  I only picked up a couple of sets from the theme including this Emergency Evacuation vehicle that I consider a van'
p19944
aS" I never got into the theme, but looking back at these sets, I have gained a better appreciation for their value in Classic Town  Let's take a look at 6445 in greater detail"
p19945
aS' Starting with the box: The back of the box providing a few alternate models: And similar imagery on the instructions: The set includes one small sheet of decals for the van: 6445 has one Res-Q minifig that I find pretty nice'
p19946
aS" I like the neon orange reflectors: He has a nice printed backside with the word RES-Q prominently displayed: This little set includes an abundance of tools: A black walkie-talkie is not pictured Here's the emergency van: I like the back section that has a nice winch with turning wheel and a few hooks for tools: Here's the minifig pulling the grappling hook for some Res-Q action"
p19947
aS" This is my favorite part of this set: The van isn't too fancy but has some neat features: While I like the blue windshield piece for maybe space sets, I'm not really fond of its use for the van: The van has no steering wheel, but rather two levers for steering: On the top of the vehicle are two emergency alarms and some extra lights: The back of the van has a large opening piece that allows wide access to the back section: It comfortably fits a long gurney/stretcher: Here's the driver resting on the gurney: He should never have tried to pick up the gurney without a 2nd Res-Q minifig"
p19948
aS' And a shot of the back section without the gurney: Lastly, a picture of the complete set: Final Thoughts Res-Q is really a neat theme that has great play value for kids'
p19949
aS" While it's not one of my more favorite town sub-themes, it does offer some nice pieces and an abundance of black and yellow pieces"
p19950
aS' I think a few of the Res-Q sets go nicely with the Divers theme released one year earlier in 1997'
p19951
aS' I had a chance to purchase the largest set of the theme, 6479 Emergency Response Center, at half the price, but passed back in the late 90s'
p19952
aS" I'd be interested in finding out what other EB members think of this set and the Res-Q theme "
p19953
aS' Wow, and people complain that a military type line would be to violent'
p19954
aS" Here we have half dead soilders and a space shuttle bombing people with severed skeleton heads! i have to say this is the first time i've heard of this theme"
p19955
aS' I like the colors as most have pointed out  The base plate is preety cool two  Could use it to moc up some garages '
p19956
aS" I am a proud owner of this set  Like others, I got it discounted and couldn't resit the parts pack  This is the type of lego sets that bothers me"
p19957
aS' When you look at it now, you\'d be tempted to say "hey not bad", but at the same time, some years ago, it wasn\'t good enough to buy it full price'
p19958
aS' I was kinda disappointed because usually sets using that kinda baseplates are excellent (castle, paradisa), and this one is just "ok"'
p19959
aS' One really minus point would be the lack of any opponent faction in the set'
p19960
aS" That's IT! Thanks for the review but now you make me want to build my own one! THANKS A LOT! ON a more serious note, I really like this set and have always wished to aquire it"
p19961
aS' I have two broken Tie Interceptors, so this should be a easy build'
p19962
aS' And as someone in the pirate forum, I think, said, It would be a great baseplate for building cave to hide the booty! Thanks PMG and welcome!'

p19974
aS" When rumours of the set name first circulated, speculation was swift: 'Twilight - that suggests something sleek, elegant and mysterious"
p19975
aS"' Anticipation mounted! Fan-frenzy grew! Finally a pic leaked! And the verdict was  "
p19976
aS" 'clunk-a-dunk' It appeared that in the Jedi off-season, Anakin was running something that looked like an intergalactic garbage scow, like Roger Wilco in the old Sierra Space Quest PC games"
p19977
aS' Blocky and bley seemed to sum it up  The set went from being one of the most anticipated to one of the least liked of 2008 pretty much instantly'
p19978
aS" It's a mark of that dislike that in the EB Clone Wars review feeding frenzy nobody has so far even bothered to post a few pics of this set even 2 weeks after it's official release! I'm here to redress that imbalance now and find out if 7680 is as horrendous as everyone originally thought Part 1: Box & Parts Front of the box"
p19979
aS" It's quite big, same size as the 10144 Sandcrawler  Annoyingly, it's the old style with the perforated corners that you have to tear to flip open the lid"
p19980
aS" Detail of the back, showing set functions: Interior of the box - a lot of wasted space  The set comes with 2 instruction manuals, each 76 pages  And no DSS sheet! Polybags! 13 of 'em"
p19981
aS' Like the other CW sets, these are unnumbered'
p19982
aS' Parts ahoy! You can tell at a glance that this set is comparable to the AT-TE, although there a large proportion of the 800+ parts here are technic pins and bley plates'
p19983
aS' Part 2: Minifigs and Build The set comes with 4 figs (or 3 5, depending on how you look at Rotta ): Anakin, Ahsoka, R2-D2 and Rotta'
p19984
aS" Very disappointing that there's nothing new here for such a high-priced exclusive, although I guess it is maybe movie accurate"
p19985
aS" Anyway, to paraphrase the wise Patsy Stone, you can never have enough hats, shoes or new Anakin/ Ahsoka hairpieces so it's not too bad  Pics of the build in progress"
p19986
aS" A quarter of the way through we can already see that this is one of those 'convoluted technic frames with some plates affixed' type builds: Half-way and the smaller wing is added: At the three quarter mark the giant single wing is added: And voila! Done! The final quarter is a race to attach all the exterior surfaces and details such as the engine and escape pod"
p19987
aS' The build itself is a mixed blessing  It is VERY technic oriented'
p19988
aS" I'm not a Technic-ally minded person and don't really have much of a conceptual grasp of how everything functions until I see the final result, so I find these type of builds a little uninteresting"
p19989
aS' Pins, axles and beams? Give me bricks any day! I really liked the 7676 Gunship and the 7679 Fighter Tank although they do contain some technic framework, they are largely brick-built ships, especially the Fighter Tank which is solid, largely brick built and full of neat functions'
p19990
aS" The 7680 build is one of the most technicy builds I've ever undergone in a System set, akin to the experience of building the 10178 Motorised AT-AT"
p19991
aS' But whereas with that set you could understand the need for a technic framework (the thing walks!) a lot of this seemed excessive'
p19992
aS' Yes, the Twilight does some have nice functions, and it is so large and heavy it does need a strong skeleton, but to me it just seemed too much and aesthetics have been sacrificed for (in some cases limited) functionality'
p19993
aS' I will discuss in more detail what I mean as I look at different parts of the set'
p19994
aS' On the upside, this is the only non-symmetric set in the CW range, so at least every page and new step brings something different! Part 3: A Closer View Close-up of the main body of the ship: Front-on'
p19995
aS" It is well-designed how the figs appear in line of sight (unlike the 6211 where Jabba and Leia were photoshopped in to the box art)  Don't ask what Rotta is doing out of the line of vision there"
p19996
aS' Some things are better left unsaid  Side view, showing escape pod (smaller cylinder) and drive: Top view: Rear view, showing back door  The rear deck is huge  Indeed, the whole ship is huge  Oddly so'
p19997
aS" I don't know if this is movie-scale or not, but I've seen people complain the fighter tank is too big (!) and that set is nothing compared to this baby! It's wider than the Gunship and in wingspan and length is almost bigger"
p19998
aS" Here's a few pics next to an MTT for comparison  Pretty big, hey? Turning to the dark side must be good for business"
p19999
aS' Even if all you can buy is a rusty old beast like this, at least you could comfortably squash pretty much every vehicle in the opposing fleet just by landing on it'
p20000
aS' At least now you can see why it costs so much  The official pics make it look smaller, somehow, by truncating the rear and wing'
p20001
aS" The ship is in fact so big you can't really pose it with wings open - only hold it that way  I was too lazy to build a giant trans-clear support strut so propped it up on a shoebox instead"
p20002
aS' The wing opens very neatly - you push a technic lever and a pin holding the bottom wing pops out quite smoothly  The little top turret can move up and down as well to get the full cross-shaped effect'
p20003
aS' Part 4: Features and Functions The front cockpit folds down very neatly, although I find the build here a little weak  Whee! It goes all the way down to the floor'
p20004
aS' The mechanism is cool, but it takes up an awful lot of space'
p20005
aS" Basically the whole front is cockpit and all Lego could manage for controls is 2 printed 1x2 tiles as well (not pictured here, but they're attached to the part that folds up and down)"
p20006
aS" There's also no way for anyone to get in or out of the cockpit  And an invisible windscreen! Technology has come a long way  Side view, looking from wing  R2D2 is here as well as some tools"
p20007
aS" You can also glimpse here one of the main problems with the set  Despite being a huge boxy ship, there's no interior! None! The Twilight doesn't even have an internal floor"
p20008
aS' All the room inside is taken up by the landing gear which folds up - again, a clever function but it really gets in the way of the set as a whole'
p20009
aS" Kudos to the designer for coming up with stable, working landing gear, but too clever by half if it means that this giant ship ends up basically being one tiny cockpit and a rear door at the back that doesn't lead to any interior! Underside showing landing gear when open: And closed - when the wing is folded down, the gear is locked in place, which is pretty neat"
p20010
aS' Space-consuming, but neat  The rear section  The door, when opened, reveals an orange cupboard and a tow-line, as Ahsoka uses in the box art'
p20011
aS' The door clicks into place when open and can be released by pressing the technic bit at the top'
p20012
aS" Again, clever, but pointless as you can't get inside! Ahsoka can indulge in a little recreational bungee-jumping if she so wishes: The rear deck is so large that it is wasted just being used so Ahsoka can bungee-jump"
p20013
aS' I came up with a much better use for it  Outdoor garden! Despite having one roboticised hand, Anakin was still quite the green thumb  And his light-saber was very useful as a hedge trimmer'
p20014
aS" So much so that he set up a side business between Rotta-rescue missions  Here's a promotional postcard: A few other bits and pieces"
p20015
aS' The gun turret on the enormous mega-wing can only hold one flick fire missile at a time (you do get two, though ) Rear engine detail: The escape pod sits neatly on the side and is basically built the same way as the Gunship bacta tank: The pod sits on these tehcnic pins and is held in place by the light bley parts: Part 5: In conclusion The Twilight is a huge ship, with a huge amount of great functions - folding wing, folding cockpit, rear door, escape pod, retractable landing gear! But this functionality comes at a price - a very complex technic build and zip interior'
p20016
aS' Compared with the Gunship, for example, which is stuffed with nooks and crannies, the Twilight suffers in this respect'
p20017
aS" I also think it is just too large - it doesn't really fit with the other craft and vehicles released with the Clone Wars line"
p20018
aS' I may be wrong and it is movie-accurate, but when you have all the CW sets laid out it does stick out like a poor thumb'
p20019
aS' Part selection is OK, with the only interesting things being a few dark orange plates, the orange cupboard and the big trans-neon green radar dish'
p20020
aS" Don't get me wrong, I don't think this is a bad set at all  It's just the other CW sets are so sweet! I would say it's an above average set in a field crammed with excellent ones"
p20021
aS" If you're a completist, buy it, but if for example you'd rather invest in another AT-TE to upgrade your Republic Army, then I couldn't really disagree with you either And to finish on a light note, I'd like to remind you that you do get another Ahsoka hairpiece, which can be used for all sorts of things"
p20022
aS" Ugha warrior upgrade: Dr Inferno hair transplant: And finally, attack of the deadly blue-ringed octopus, native to Australia's beaches and oceans! Thanks for reading!"
p20023
aS' Another outstanding review by the "awesome set reviewer"! I enjoyed reading this review very much and I felt that you have redress Twilight in an approriate manner'
p20024
aS' I have very mixed feeling about this set especially with its design  It seemed I will need to watch the Clone Wars movie in the theatre before I compared with it'
p20025
aS' Most of the time, when this LEGO set is used in a movie, you will tend to compare it and what is the actual purpose for Twilight, same as the rest of the SW vehicles and aircraft'
p20026
aS' For a high price like this, I can actually top up a little more and get the AT-TE, with the same batch of minifigs plus Commander Rex'
p20027
aS' If there is a special figure such as the V19 Torrent (Clone Pliot), it will be a much ideal scenario'
p20028
aS' At the moment, I have not bring in any Clone War sets into my collection, and I am quite sure Twilight is not in my priority list especially when I am not a full-pledged Star War collectors or I have strong intentions to complete the entire range in this recent release'
p20029
aS' Therefore, I need to prioritise my purchase, and likely to get two RGS, since that is my favourite ship in Clone War era  I am not comparing it with RGS  Both sets defintely have their pros and cons'
p20030
aS' Oh, I love that postcard you made  Certainly looks very nice! svelte_corps, thanks for doing up this superb detailed review which had given "Twilight" the neccessary attention it should have '
p20031
aS' Really awesome review svelte_corps   You did a really complete and in-depth review of this beast and with your nice pics is really enjoyable reading your review, so congrats '

p20038
aS" I will try and take a pic with some other CW sets, I don't have all of them though and some need to be reassembled as I built them on holiday and then had to pack them away I do think this line of sets has been the best SW Lego wave released though"

aS' I have the same issues with technic structured sets, and svelte_corps summed up my feelings on this beautifully  This was an even handed review, so thoughtful'
p20062
aS" Finally, you gotta love a bit of humour in a review, that gardenis brilliant  I was probably never going to get this set anyway but it sets a new world's best standard for reviews"
p20063
aS" I strongly encourage anyone that's going to review a set to have a good look at this to see how well it can be done  Thanks for the magnificent review!"
p20064
aS' Oh no! Anakin has gone over to the green side of the force! Well, I guess someone had to review the Clunkadunk eventually'
p20065
aS' And you did a good job at it, svelte corps! I liked the punchline with the Ahsoka-hairpiece swapping  The "Ugha warrior upgrade" is an interesting way of creating male Togrutas'
p20066
aS" And Ahsoka looks even hotter with Inferno's hair! Matteo Kenobi, on Aug 11 2008, 09:30 PM, said: If i am really impressed with it in the film i suppose that would change things, but i will have to see =] I wouldn't count on it"
p20067
aS' Spoiler After its first flight, the Twilight will crash and burn! Wookieepedia says so, and you can see it in one of the trailers  So, I guess the Twilight will stay mostly unbought  Poor Clunkadunk '

aS' Thanks a lot for a very nice and entertaining review! Your photos were really nice and there have been some reviews lately that have such blurry pics    cough   cough  '

p20070
aS' handle your camera! I think this ship is underrated, it is really nice! I love the playing features like landing gear and back door, perhaps just cause I had to get along with so called landing gears in the past, that did not work at all (7140 for example'
p20071
aS' )  And I simply LOVE that there is space inside  You said there is not really some cause of the landing gear mechanism, but it seems it should be easily fixed'
p20072
aS' Do you think there is enough space to put some plates over the landing gear and add some beds, kitchen und TV? I think this set is so perfect to mod it into a Clone Wars mobile home, your back garden ist just perfect for this'
p20073
aS' I prefer this over the AT-TE and over a 2nd gunship! Thanks a lot for the review!'

p20077
aS' You could do it from either the side door or rear door though, maybe move that tow line at the back  I have to say, it is a set that grows on you'
p20078

aS' I voted outstanding  Greets The-Force!'
p20080
aS' I will not be picking this one up  The main thing is that it simply looks akward  It is big and bulky, and seems to have random pieces on it with not reall streamline feel to it'
p20081
aS' I also agree that for an exclusive that it $100, it needs more than just 3 5 mini figures  Anikan and Ashoka and Rotta already come in the AT-TE, which is cheaper and has more figures'
p20082
aS' R2-D2 is a figure that I am sure everybody has at least 4 or 5 of  For that kind of money, I expect something with at least one unique figure, and more than 4'
p20083
aS' I also want just a cleaner and better designed set  This is probably the letdown of the collection so far  Every collection needs one '
p20084
aS" Seems like TLC has done a pretty accurate representation of the ship  The real fault for the ship's messy design has to go to Lucasfilm, not TLC"

p20092
aS' This sums up my opinion exactly  I can easily admit that the design of the kit is spot on - but unfortunately, the actual design of the ship in the new movie is garbage'
p20093
aS" Actually, despite the Millennium Falcon's odd design, I really think it's a pretty appealing ship - and its really cool! I can't say the same for the Twilight, though "

p20185

p20188
aS" What could possibly go wrong for this knight? The helmet I really love  IMO it's a lot better than the old knight helmets (see review of 5615 The Knight for a pic of one of those)"
p20189
aS" The Skeleton Knight: The black skeleton horse ROCKS! I love that design and in black it's even badder than than the white version"
p20190
aS" The shield reeks of dread and the knight is one bad skeleton on the rampage  I do find that the helmet is a little off! I'd rather have a black knights helmet instead"
p20191

p20201
aS" I'll buy this if I see it there though, because it looks like a great little set  I could use the awesome knight, and a skeleton that has a regular body so he looks like he is in armor!!!!!"

p20203
aS' "The only thing that puzzles me is; why would a Crown Knight joust a Skeleton?" Good question'
p20204
aS' For a joust to make sense, this set should contain two human knights instead -- which would be fine with me so long as they had differing armour and colours'

p20207
aS" Given that in prior years it wasn't possible to get a barded horse in such a small set, this set is actually a decent way to build a mounted cavalry for your kingdom"

aS" It's useful for picking up a few knights, but I'm not really partial to the skeleton  The idea of a knight and a skeleton tilting just strikes me as being odd"
p20226
aS' My biggest issue with the current castle line is that most sets force you to purchase a mixture of skeletons/knights orcs/knights orcs/dwarves etc '
p20227
aS' This is fine for those of you who love your fantasy, however it makes the line a bit underwhelming for the rest of us'
p20228

p20231
aS" And while not obvious at first, it really is backwards compatible with every castle set with a horse in it  Nonetheless, I think this set is great  It's simple, cheap and has charm"
p20232

aS" I'm a bit curious, does the knight's helm have a hole for plume? I've been debating whether to purchase this set or not"
p20253
aS" I'm not a big fan of horses so I'll likely barely use them, but I do like the unique minifigs, weapon rack/weapons, and the fact that the divider has a few useful pieces that can be added to other sets"
p20254
aS" However, I just don't feel the set is worth $8 when compared to Crossbow attack and the Knight's Catapult unless the buyer is really wanting some mounted minifigs"
p20255
aS' Luckily, Amazon just lowered their price of this set from $8 to $6 (along with another 20% if using Bill Me Later    just in case anyone was also in the same situation I was in)'

p20258
aS" Yes, there is a hole for placing the knight's plume  Do correct me wrong, if I had answered wrongly  It's been awhile since I last touched my castle sets  Thanks KimT for this fine review"
p20259
aS' This is one of the castle sets which I had bought high volume, mainly for its horses, barding and the weapons  A great army builder and accessories for your castle armies  This is an instant "5" '
p20260
aS" First things first  The knight's helm does have a spot for a plume  Now, I really like this set and it was the first one I dug into when I got my collection in the mail"
p20261
aS' It has a great selection of equipment for good or evil figures and the barding for the horse is outstanding  My only wish was for one of the long chrome swords for the knights'
p20262
aS' I think the new knights with the tall shield and chrome sword look excellent on foot and on horseback'
p20263
aS" It would definitely be neat to revisit this set with another human knight instead of the skeleton  Make that change and add a lady to joust for and it'd be bang on "

p20265
aS" I remember reading once that it was because they contained wine glasses and TLG felt they wouldn't be able to market a toy that encourage the drinking of alcohol  This set was one of them"
p20266
aS' I remember seeing this in a catalog that came with a Fabuland set and wondering what it was and where I could get one'
p20267
aS' I wrote to LEGO and got an overseas catalog which had the Futuron 6990 Monorail Transport System in it before it was available in the US  I was amazed'
p20268
aS" I ended up buying 6349 Holiday Villa from that catalog but, for some reason, gave it to my best friend for his birthday  I've always wanted this set and finally bought it from Bricklink this year   "
p20269

p20271
aS' This base plate is an excellent piece and was only available in two sets: Classic LEGO telephone: Technically, these blue windows 1 x 4 x 5 windows are only available in this set, according to Bricklink'
p20272
aS' It was available in different form (with and without fixed glass, trans blue glass) in other sets  Regardless this size and color window is rare and the blue door was only available in 4 sets'
p20273
aS" This was a huge selling point for me as I'm a window monkey"
p20274
aS" Never heard that term? It's like a parts monkey (a collector who buys mulitples of sets just for parts or large lots of bulk from BL and sorts them into bins) but just for windows"
p20275
aS" Tell your friends I coined the term: These sloped windows have endless possibilities in many themes (maybe not with the curtain decals applied) but are another great rare part that appears in this set: The build Remember this piece? I'd like to see a badass Agents car built on this car base! : I am a fan of the six-wide car but I see the appeal of the four wide"
p20276
aS" It has a very nostalgic feel to it: There's no denying that this is a beauty of classic LEGO 4-wide cars: This set comes with two mini-figures, one of which appears to be a painter"
p20277
aS" Classic vintage LEGO figs: Onto the house which begins with the basic floorplan: A kitchen that's open to the rest of the house and a little oven and hood vent is one of my favorite touches"
p20278
aS" It's one thing to throw an oven into a house set, but the designer of this set made it a cool part of the architecture of the house which gives it a unique feel: The completed first floor and carport: I do wish the sides of the roof were white with a little overhang like an actual roof"
p20279
aS" This method of white on bottom, red on top looks more like a child's drawing than a real house  This is easily fixed with some modifying"
p20280
aS' Still, you get a lot of roof pieces in this set: Here we have the completed set  The husband cleans the yard while the wife gets plastered on wine'
p20281
aS" Don't tell the American kids! Another angle: Working in the kitchen: Getting smashed before dinner  I think she may have a serious problem: The bedroom"
p20282
aS' A little stark, but the bed looks comfy: Overall shot of the interior: Rating Playability: 9/10 (The possibilities are endless with Drunky McWine-Wine and husband'
p20283
aS" Really, playability is up to the imagination of the player  It's a house, not really very action-packed ) Design: 9 5/10 (Great design with plenty of rare parts"
p20284
aS' Love the classic car, too! Loses half a point for the all red roof   ) Price: NA (I believe this was inexpensive, but since I have no proof, I will have to leave this factor out of the overall rating'
p20285
aS") Overall: 9 25/10 (Classic sets like this all deserve 10s in my book, but looking at it with an objective eye it's Excellent, but not perfect )"
p20286
aS" This looks like a really great set! I wasn't around in '88 to get it but I like it! It actually has things inside the interior! Thanks for the review"

aS'Aerial Recovery Set #: 6462 Theme: Town Res-Q Year Released: 1998 Piece Count: 201 Minifigs: 3 List Price: $25 (USD) My personal favorite of the Res-Q theme released in 1998 was this helicopter, 6462 Aerial Recovery'
p20466
aS' The set offered a pretty modern helicopter, raft, three-wheeler, rescue gurney and net, and three figs including a diver  The set is action-packed and offers a high degree of play value'
p20467
aS' Starting with the box, front side and back: Front Back I always liked the rough ocean/sea water pictured in the boxart'
p20468
aS' The same image from the front of the box appears on the cover of the instructions: But the back of the instructions picture a plain view of the copter: One sticker sheet with a few "Res-Q" stickers is included, mainly for the tail section of the helicopter: Interestingly, the set includes three figures, one being a diver'
p20469
aS' What I always found strange is the inclusion of an "X-Treme Team" Diver who has the logo on his torso (although it\'s a very nice fig): Back shot: I think this was my first set with a Lego three-wheeler'
p20470
aS" I always liked it a lot: The set includes a yellow raft (also found in the Divers sets) and some scuba gear: NOTE: the raft has a black piece in it's center for lifting up by the helicopter For sea and emergent rescue, a gurney can also be lifted by the helicopter: The set also includes a net with hook to lift the three-wheeler and other items"
p20471
aS" An extra string pulls the net closed: Here's a shot of the helicopter: The front section has a large trans  blue piece enclosing the cockpit: Inside is a printed radar slope: A smaller trans"
p20472
aS" blue piece appears a bit higher for access to the middle section of the helicopter and/or a small storage area: In the middle section is an place for the gurney and a box for storing some of the adventure gear: Here's a picture showing the gurney: On the side is a pulley mechanism that swings to the right when not in use: On the opposite side is the winch to raise and lower the grappling hook: Here's a picture of an open storage box: I like the tail section with propeller: Decal is not shown Here's another shot of the copter from a different angle: And the final image, the entire set: Final Thoughts Personally, I think this is pretty nice set"
p20473
aS' I like the thought of using the helicopter to rescue people at sea using the working winch  Extras like the trike/three-wheeler and the rescue net make the set even more fun'
p20474
aS' Hope you enjoy this Res-Q review '
p20475
aS" Thanks for this review TheBrickster, i also have this set and think it's one of the best helicopters TLG made in the 90's  It's quite big and has got place for 2 minifigs in the cockpit"
p20476
aS" I also like the fact that there's a victim included in form of the x-treme diver, which also is a theme i always loved as a kid"

p20874
aS" We got a bridge over troubled waters, but be aware, it's very unstable! Love the wood patterns on the yellow 1x6 tiles: On a corner a camera is mounted to document the wild life: For the evenings we also got a little campfire: Down by the river sits a grey falcon and watches the guys on their challenges: What's that? Seems not very safe, to be honest"
p20875
aS' be aware when you pass by these rocks        '
p20876
aS"cause it will collapse! Let's move up again where the tent is placed, inside is plenty of space to take a rest for the figs and to store their equipment: But i think they should have built the tent on another place cause the ground isn't very good there: When you pull the mechanism, a trap door opens: Will the guys all come back home safe and not injured? You decide! All in all this is a really great set, ome may say it is a bit juniorized because of the baseplate, but it really isn't"

Rp20929
aS' Thanks for the review! Rock Raiders was one of the last new themes i knew as a kid before my dark ages came'
p20930
aS' Unfortunately i never managed to get any sets from it, beside a few months ago the 4910 The Hover Scout, which i review a while ago  Wish i can get some of the bigger sets in the future '
p20931
aS' I always thought that this set was under-rated  It contains a really interesting collection of parts, a decent fig, and introduces an odd theme in only one set'
p20932
aS" Very well designed for one of the 'not greats'  God Bless, Nathan"
p20933
aS" Hello all Eurobricks members and Classic Town Lovers, *** Editor's Note: To mark the celebration of Classic Town, this set which is released in 1994 and re-released as a LEGEND in 2002"
p20934
aS" Pizza to Go Review, is dedicated to Classic Town's opening cermony and members such as Hinckley, Brickster, ImperialShadows, Sinner and many others whom have contributed to the final success of Classic Town! Thank you so much for inviting me to be part of this wonderful project, and I wish all the best to the success of Classic Town! I urge everyone of you to check out Classic Town and take alook at the cool stuff we have done! *** Today, I will be doing up a review on Pizza To Go set"
p20935
aS' This outlet is one of the most favourite eatery for any LEGO citizens living in their town  When they are driving on the road, they are sure to look out "PIZZERIA" signage'
p20936
aS' They offer the best pizza in town  No one in town can resist the delicious aroma of Pizza, coming out from the red chimney'
p20937
aS' Let us find out why is this shop so popular among so many LEGO citizens and was one of the famous sets that is re-released under the "LEGEND" theme  Pizza To Go is my favourite set of all time'
p20938
aS' I believed there is no other pizza outlet lying around in any LEGO city apart Pizzeria  It seemed there are the sole outlet that is selling pizza for many years'
p20939
aS' This set was re-released in 2002 and it is part of the LEGEND theme  This is one of the few sets that are highly demanded to be brought back by many fans of LEGO around the world  I owned the 6350'
p20940
aS' Any members whom had owned both sets before? Is there any difference between these two? Because when I searched through Peeron, it shown 144 pieces instead of 194 pieces for the 1994 set'
p20941
aS' Name: Pizza To Go Theme: LEGO System / Town Year: 1994 (Re-release: 2002) Pieces: 194 Minifigs: 3 An image of a 6350, Pizza To Go Let the delivery begins! Pizza To Go is the regular pizza outlet that sells nothing but pizza'
p20942
aS' They deliever pizza to every household in town, with their trusty delivery van  Walk-in are welcomed too'
p20943
aS' There is a stand for customers to dine in their pizza quickly before making their way to their next destination'
p20944
aS' In my opnon, no town can ever survive without the Pizza Tradition! Devoted "PIZZERIA" staff Every outlet comes with 3 dedicated staff, making sure that operations will run smoothly'
p20945
aS' On the left, we will have the Pizza Boy, whom is wearing the regular blue dungarees and its white cap  I wonder who is that boy? On the middle, we will have the Pizza Girl'
p20946
aS' She looks like any typical sweet girl in town that the boys will look at  She is wearing a suntop strapless on her  She reminded me of one person though, I think her name is called Alice'
p20947
aS' Taking a careful look, I wonder if ImperialShadows is the Pizza Boy back then, without that black patch on its left eye? On another note, this mini-figure was my favourite'
p20948
aS' Female mini-figures are very uncommon back then  I am glad I have this figure, adding to my town population  On the right, we will have the hardworking chef, preparing the pizzas in the oven'
p20949
aS' He wears the regular white chef outfit, but he wear a grey pants instead of the usual full-white outfit in most resturants such as Breezeway Cafe (6376)'
p20950
aS" Let's take a closer look at the Pizza Boy's van! This van is very very small looking and very fuel efficient  It is able to cut lanes very fast due to its small size"
p20951
aS' The pizza van is made up of 4-studs wide design  No doors by the side  However, in this vehicle, I think the doors is not a must to be included in this design'
p20952
aS' Our Pizza Boy will need to leave vehicle pretty fast, and ensuring that the pizza delivery is on time'
p20953
aS' Common mechanism This van has the regular rooftop that can be lifted up to place the Pizza Boy into the driver seat'
p20954
aS' There is a sun roof on its top, which enable him to let him have some sunlight from above! The logo on the side of it, is actually a transparent sticker, which have the PIZZERIA itallian logo and a tasty looking pizza on both sides of its van'
p20955
aS' I like that sticker very much  Mine looks quite worn out over time  If its a printed piece, It will be a terrific bonus  Nevertheless, I can still accept the sticker'
p20956
aS' Our pizza van can deliever up to 2 pizza at a go! At every trip, 2 piping hot pizza will be stored at the back of the van  The pizza is fitted in perfectly in each compartment'
p20957
aS" Furthermore, the white window shutter, is terrific in this design  You don't see this kind of design anymore  I think, I have not seen much delivery vans on the street anymore too"
p20958
aS' Base of the van From the base, you can see that it is using of the regular red car base that is common in most 4-studs vehicle design'
p20959
aS' In fact, this car base served as a foundation for its vehicle design  Back of PIZZERIA Alice and the Chef will be showing you around at the back of the kitchen'
p20960
aS' There is an oven on the left, a water tap and a holder for the oar stick  Looks pretty empty right? Look below for a surprise! My favourite feature! This oven can be used to heat up 2 pizzas at a go'
p20961
aS' Now, I understand why, this set is named "Pizza To Go"  I have been using their slogan unknowingly  This feature is superb nice'
p20962
aS' Now, we know that the pizza is prepared from the outlet instead of using delivery van to collect it from a factory'
p20963
aS' Alice, what are you waiting for? Help the Chef quickly! PIZZERIA! The signage sure looks big from far and catches their attention easily too with its pleasnt looking design'
p20964
aS" As you have already noticed, this is made up of sticker  I don't mind, for this set, it contains sticker"
p20965
aS' Sometimes, I do hope they can give us spare sticker for us to change, after a long period of time  Distinct red chimney This is the front of the oven, and that is where the smoke comes out'
p20966
aS' Using only bricks to construct this, is simply wonderful  I like the use of their white bricks to construct the wall layout, and a combination of red parts, especially on the top'
p20967
aS' I like the look of this very much  Another picture on its side Printed parts In this set, you will get a total of 5 pizzas! And, I believed no other sets offer so many pizza'
p20968
aS' You can placed up to 4 pizzas in the van and oven  Alice will be carrying the last pizza around  The green and red round dish is a printed part'
p20969
aS" Most Exclusive part in 6350/10036 The most unique and important printed parts that is only exclusive in this set  It's at the front of the Pizza van"
p20970
aS' It is none other, but the Pizzeria logo, standing at the front of the delivery van  (Forgotten to take a picture of this piece, took it from Peeron'
p20971
aS') Different views of Pizza To Go outlet Another bright sunday day in Pizza To Go! Summary review Playability: 10/10 (A lot of playing by doing up the pizza process'
p20972
aS' From preparing to delivery) Design: 9 5/10 (Outstanding design, with great use of bricks  I like the structure of it very much) Price: 9 5/10 (An inexpensive set based on the 1994 pricing'
p20973
aS' It comes with 3 mini-figs, shop, a van, and a exclusive printed piece) Overall: 9 7/10 (I am not trying to be bias  In fact, this set is absoultely filled with minimum flaws'
p20974
aS' Look at my review again, if you are not satisfied with it, or tell me what you don\'t like!) I gave it a "5" based on my Review Score Card'
p20975
aS' What about yours? Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine  Comments and Critics are strongly welcomed  Pictures can be found in My Brickshelf(When moderated)'
p20976
aS' Easily one of the best town sets ever (and pretty expensive for its size too, is/was it that rare?)'
p20977
aS' I hope I still have all the pieces from mine, unfortunately, my stickers are in pretty bad shape (took them off because I needed the bricks, stupid stickers covering multiple parts , only downside to this set)'
p20978
aS' The design is simple, yet so detailed, and the pizza van looks great  5/5'
p20979
aS" I do like the set, although I don't own it  I do remember lusting after it when I was a kid, though (mainly because of the female minifig and the colors)"
p20980
aS" It's a bit simplistic, but comes with a few great parts  You also did a great job on describing the set, and the pictures give the full impression of the appearance"
p20981
aS' For the review, I just have to point out a few things, to give you constructive criticism: first of all, it\'s chef, not "chief" (entirely different professions), and secondly, the scale you give in the poll isn\'t very even'
p20982
aS' "Above average" jumps to "outstanding", which is a too big of a gap in my opinion  You should\'ve used "Good" or "Great" in between them  But these are only minor faults, this is a good review anyway!'
p20983
aS" I rate it a full 5 too  And I wish Lego would make a set like this in 2010  A town needs pizza! Edit: don't always trust Peeron"
p20984
aS" Sometimes they miss some pieces, and sometimes they just can't count them! Edited by The Cobra, 24 August 2008 - 11:41 AM "

p20990
aS' But these are only minor faults, this is a good review anyway! Sandy, I appericate your constructive comments in order to improve the quality of my review  I had amended the word "chief" to "chef"'
p20991
aS' You might want to check it  I did not notice that I was using the wrong word  As for the poll definitions which have been used, for 1 to 5'
p20992
aS' We used "Poor" to represent value "1" while "Outstanding" to represent value "5"'
p20993
aS' We need to use clear definitions to illustrate and demostrate non-bias towards the review for the readers to cast their vote depending on their individual liking'
p20994
aS' Therefore, we used a common word which is known as "Average"'
p20995
aS" In surveys, for measuring its sample size's liking, we have to use words which is neutral such as Strongly agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, Strongly disagree"
p20996
aS" That's why, we used this rating approach to represent the terms  The Cobra, on Aug 24 2008, 07:37 PM, said: I rate it a full 5 too  And I wish Lego would make a set like this in 2010"
p20997
aS" A town needs pizza! Edit: don't always trust Peeron  Sometimes they miss some pieces, and sometimes they just can't count them! I am hoping to see a pizza outlet again, maybe in 2010"
p20998
aS' Well, Peeron can sometimes be not very accurate but it can served as a very useful guide in most areas '

aS": 6479 Name: Emergency Response Center Number of minifigs: 5 Number of pieces: 420 Release Year: 1998 Unfortunately i don't have many of the boxes of my res-q sets anymore, so i'll start right off with the instructions this time: On the backside there is no alternate model as usual this time, but only a different shot of the whole set: Next, a general overview, sorry about the slightly bad picture quality on some pics this time: Originally this set has 5 minfigs (which all are really nice!), but the guy who drives the tow truck has been lost in the flood Here's a picture of the missing fig: Let's move on to the vehicles, we have something for the water, the ground and the air in this set, first the great tow truck: I love the mechanism with the hooks in the back: Next on, da Speedboat! At the rear, it's got a stretcher and a wench, which adds a lot of playability: If there's a a little accident near the coast, the trike comes to appearance: For more complicated stuff, we have a little helicopter (i broke the rotating piece at the top yesterday, ouch! : ) No space for a victim you say? Well, not really, but the helicopter also got a wench with a hook in the back: Now it comes to the station itself, at the docks a neat life belt sign is mounted (remember, at this time there weren't real ones as today): A little more right an equipment holder is placed, with various tools on the front"
p21105
aS"and fire fighter equip at the back: At the very front a little lighttower secures the shelter: I haven't quite found out what this thing is supposed to be, maybe somebody knows Another equipment holder, this time with all the stuff you need for diving: More equipment"
p21106
aS'and even MORE! We come to the hear piece of the station, the control room with lots of buttons and scrrens: Last but not least, a quick shot of all the accesoires and tools that you get, which really is an A-MA-ZING amount! This set might have a few junioriced pieces, as the big window in the front or the "briedge" on the roof, but that doesn\'t matter, because there is nearly one other set in which you get so much rare pieces and such an overwhelming amount of accesoires, so i can recommend that for everybody who is a pieces-fanatic'
p21107
aS' Not to forget the playability, the great figs and the, in my opinion very good color scheme  Once again thanks for taking the time reading and looking at my review, i hope you liked it'

p21110
aS' The Res-Q theme is one of my faves of all time actually, I own nearly all of them (missing a small set that was only available in the US or Japan, I think)  Dr  S '

p21117
tp21118
Rp21119
aS" I have this set and it's pretty nice  I love the Res-Q theme in general  I think that tow truck is easily the highlight of this set and is probably the best such vehicle I've seen in any City set"
p21120
aS" The other vehicles are also great  The base itself is lacking though, as it basically consists of one room that doesn't even have side walls"
p21121
aS' It does include a cool 3x6 computer sticker and a vast array of minifig tools and equipment though'
p21122
aS' I have some plans to modify the building and make it larger but have never gotten around to doing it '
p21123
aS' I just built this set in MLCad as a requestfor a fellow Eurobricks member  Somehow I missed out on this set completely when it came out  I was really suprised how long it took to build (virtually)'
p21124
aS' Despite its size this set is packed with details, minifigs, vehicles and tools'

p21127
aS" With it's futuristic look and yes, that tow truck too, oh yeah heaps of equipment ! It's not over Junorised, there is still plenty of building in it  Thanks and have A HAPPY NEW YEAR, 'Metalandi' !"
p21128
aS" Hi everyone, this is my first review on LEGO sets here  Hope you guys like it  And I would like to apologise for the bad quality pictures  Hope you guys don't mind"
p21129
aS' First I will start with the box art  Box art: I guess this is the first time that LEGO Star Wars sets use white and blue colour for their box  I like the new colour scheme, a nice blend though'
p21130
aS" Here's the front: The back: Not to waste space on the box LEGO do some advertisement to attract us to buy more sets  :grin:the more The side: At the top side there is this minifigs scale picture"
p21131
aS' It is great as we get to know the real size of a minifigs  Contents: The contents consist of a sticker sheet, instruction book, and 8 packet of bricks  The packer are not numbered'
p21132
aS' But it is ok as there is not much pieces'
p21133
aS' Instruction book and random page: As usual the instruction book have brick checklist, other sets pictures, and tutorial on how you should assemble your set (I mean the very first page)'
p21134
aS" Sticker sheet: There is not much sticker sheet and is a great news that the Republic logo on the round plate is printed unlike Republic Gunship  Anyway, I didn't apply the stickers"
p21135
aS' The Commander Gear: This is a new thing to minifigs as well  Well is like Batman accessories, they pack it in one small packet  However, you only get one commander gear pack in this set'
p21136
aS" Anyway, i didn't use them  The minifigs: Well, we get the the new minifigs  The ugly face clone, new printed torso and new mold of helmet"
p21137
aS' However i not really like the new head stud, i prefer a black one or at least the one like Jango Fett, black colour with face'
p21138
aS' The helmet: Everything is printed, no holes at the visor there, but there are hole on the both side  This new helmet mold also made the headgear turn 360 degree freely'
p21139
aS' Without helmet: With helmet: You can see the flesh tone at the hole beside  The blasters: @ short blasters were given instead of long one  Is great, at least they give us two blasters instead of one'
p21140
aS" The tank: Here is the pics of the tank  It was not badly design nor nicely design  But it looks great if you didn't saw the beneath or under the tank"
p21141
aS" View from front: View from side: View from back: What's beneath? Under it was 4 wheels, to make it move fluently"
p21142
aS' It is made by the thread supporter like the one we fet from TIE Crawler or Bat-Tank The functions: Well firstly, you can open up the hood (I guess) to see the engine'
p21143
aS' Secondly the side cannon that can move upwards  The thing is quite tight (see random instruction page) and there is barrier to block the cannon from going downwards'
p21144
aS' The cockpit: Well the cockpit is small and the space is limited  The monitor stuff is printed brick and is another great news'
p21145
aS' You have to remove the piece (pic below) to reveal the cockpit and put your clone to pilot it  Pop-up gunner mechanism: Well the backdoor have a thing to attack to the seat of the gunner'
p21146
aS' The top hatch is very loose  So it there is a clone as a gunner and you open the back door, the clone will pop-up and automatically open the hatch on top'
p21147
aS' This is how the top looks like without a clone  There is this movable cannon (upwards, left and right) and a little keyboard thing with it  But the cannon fall off quite easily'
p21148
aS' The flick launching missile mechanism: The mechanism is on both side and you need to turn the thing inwards to reveal the flick fire mechanism  Below are the pic of how it is turned'
p21149
aS' You can keep you blaster at the front of the side  There are place for you to store them  It close nicely  Completion: This is how it looks like  Extra parts: There quite a number of them'
p21150
aS' Overall: This set is not bad  The price is quite expensive but you will like it'
p21151
aS' The pop-up mechanism is something new (to me) but this set have more function and 2 Clone Trooper with a pack of Commander gear'
p21152
aS' Pros: -2x Clone Troopers -high playability -nice design Cons: -a little expensive -sticker sheet -cannon on top falls off quite easy Edited by KimT, 27 August 2008 - 12:16 PM '

p21301
aS' 2/Contents The instructions: There are 2 books included with the set: One for the forklift, and one for the truck  Minifigure(1) The first minifig you build is a simple cargo worker'
p21302
aS' Interesting/new parts: Here we have some interesting and new parts  They include a yellow seat, a 1x2 plate with clips, and a 1x4 slope'
p21303
aS' 3/The build Cargo1 The first cargo palette has a few crates on it  I really like the sticker on the small box'
p21304
aS' Forklift: The forklift is a very fun extra to build, and it is probably the best forklift that we have had so far  It is very realistic and is very strong'
p21305
aS' Cargo2 The next piece of cargo is some Octan barrels on a meter  I am not sure what It is supposed to be, but it is still a nice addition to the set'
p21306
aS' Minifgure(2) The second minifigure is a classic driver with sunglasses and a coffee mug  Very nice  New piece! This is a very nice new piece that is included in the set, a hollow canopy'
p21307
aS' I believe it is also in White with the police mobile command station'
p21308
aS' Truck: Now anyone who has had one of the Lego City Harbor sets from last year, then you will probably find this build to be very similar  Mostly in the cab part of the truck'
p21309
aS' The trucks build is very solid, and very realistic  I sense ths will bring the ratings up quite a bit'
p21310
aS' Mystery Cargo: For some time specualtion has been going around, what exactly is this? It seems like nuero poison   I am very happy with those 2x2 cylinders in trans-yellow'
p21311
aS' In fact, you can join in and guess what it may be in this topic  Containers: The first container is built to hold one palette  It fits onto the truck'
p21312
aS' It produces a very pleasing result, and has a better look to it than the Containers from last year had'

aS"99 1/Box The box for this set is suprisingly small  It's about the size of a $3 99 set  It shows the Main Forklift, and the set information  The back of the box features the Dragster"
p21376
aS' A very cool model, and the suspension works perfectly  2/Contents We have two instruction booklets; One for the Forklift and one for the Dragster'
p21377
aS' The bags: Here are a few interesting pieces: The long double pin in blue, a bionicle connecter joint, and a yellow L joint'
p21378
aS" 3/Build We start off build nice and solid, with your average technic build: The following steps build up the detail of the bottom part  Next comes the cab  It's pretty simple yet effective"
p21379
aS' After that comes the Forks  They work very well, but If you have the palatte on them, and you let go, it might topple off'
p21380
aS' Hint: Put the edge of the palatte on the small lip on the pieces that connect to the forks  This will hold it on better'
p21381
aS' The finished Product and palatte: Extra Pieces(keep them, as they are used to build the alternate model): Here is something that I found- how to put a minifigure into the cab'
p21382
aS' First, remove the side doors  Then, set the fig into the cab, with his arm sticking slightly out the gap  And finaly, seal off the cab  A nice way to put system into technic for your towns'
p21383
aS' ---------------------------- Parts: 9/10(Loving them all ) Price per part ratio: 8/10(Somewhat Pleaseing) Playability: 9/10: Works in any system town, and has a great dragster alternate model'
p21384
aS' Overall: 26/30 86% B+ Overall I would definatly recommend this set to anyone, whether you are a system or technic fan, this is perfect  It has great parts, and is pretty cheap'

aS'99 (It seem no source online has the price) Peeron com Bricklink com As always lets have a look at the box first as I?m luck to own a boxed version of this set'
p21407
aS' Walking across a planet with a grid pattern sky! The back shows a great selection of alternative models'

aS' After opening the box we find a single instruction booklet Inside the instruction booklet Now we come to the man in the black visor the Mark I Blacktron and black and industrial he look'

aS' In my opinion I think he probably has the second best Lego Space torso'
p21410
aS' Before the focus group decided they needed to be brighter Now turning to the walker itself, it?s a simple build which I don?t think even I with my great skills for messing up could get wrong'
p21411
aS' The final unit is built in three key parts  The command pod which is attached to the body by two pins at the back  The walker legs, this is pure design genius'
p21412
aS' Simply built easy to replicate and no fancy parts  The top section which open to reveal the Blacktrons high-tech tools'

p21419
aS' A set which in my opinion showcases what Lego was about in the 1980?s  The set has an excellent design ethic and looks great, with very limited parts it retains great action and functionality'
p21420
aS' Twinned with the great main model you?re shown that there are a number of other great models you can make with the same parts'

aS' The Cardinal then asked was all the rejoicing justified   Set Name: The Knight Set Number: 5615 Number of Pieces: 21 Figures:1 Released: 2008 List Price: 2 00 Lets us begin with the box'
p21573
aS' The front shows us are knight and his rack of arms  The back shows us two sets from the Castle range  Moving inside the box now  The contents of the box, it doesnt look like much'
p21574
aS' The instructions to help you through the build  Now the reason you probably bought the set, well at least why I did the Knight  This features the new torso for 2008 and is the height of fashion'
p21575
aS' This brings the number of printed torsos from the Crown Knights to three, which allows for a greater variety in building your armies'
p21576
aS' A new fashion sensation and all the must have accessories for this season  With a more heavily armoured look hes ready for anything'
p21577
aS' The rest of the set is a weapons rack, I assume that once youve got a few of these set youll probably like me give up building them and part them out'
p21578
aS' But anyway here are some pictures of what the rest of the elements are spent on  A long and complex build begins'
p21579
aS' After 360 hour finally its finished sadly five minfigs were hurt in the construction of this rack  Now the money shot, where we can see it all come together'
p21580
aS' It looks great even the rack doesnt look to bad  Sadly are hero wasnt ready for other themes just yet  In total we have a good army builder which castle fans have wanted'
p21581
aS' However there remains a question in my mind as to if this set is good enough on its own  Without any other castle sets I cant see it being to much fun so its not a good present'
p21582
aS' The Rating System Figures: 9/10 (Great new fashion for this season ) Parts 8/10 (Shield, sword, spear, helmet and armour what more could I want? Well two shields'
p21583
aS') Fun Fun Fun 3/10 (Sadly its rather dull on its own I cant think or to much else to do ) Design 7/10 (Yes its the army builder Ive wanted design, well apart from that Pirate one ) Price 9/10 (At 2'
p21584
aS'00 what more can I say ) Grand Total 36/50 (Let down by being to small to stand alone  ) Conclusion'
p21585
aS' So lets answer the question, is it the army all castle fans have wanted? Well yes and no is the answer  While it is a great set and at the now reduced UK price of 2 00 amazing value'
p21586
aS' I still think its inferior compared with the army building capability of Cross Bow attack, I much prefer army building both factions at once '

p21600
aS' Now the single minfig of the set, nothing new of special that I can see  got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company'

p21603

aS' This set is yet another in a long line of Lego digger and to be honest its not the best in my opinion  I still hold nostalgic memories for 6504 which I still think is a great digger'
p21608
aS' From my point of view the set sits to high off the ground and make me wonder how the worker gets in'
p21609
aS' I really dont like the digging arm action it will never be smooth and while it poses better I just think its inferior  Despite this I still think its not a bad set, Id just like it to be so much more'

p21627
aS" His is a very neat little guy, but sadly, he doesn't really become a weapon  More of a block of red and black bricks"

aS' The torso: Now the torso design for Assault tiger is very different from the past years  It now uses a castle-like piece as the main structure  Also of note is that he has a mini throne'
p21629
aS" No controls, sadly  And with the orange cockpit piece, it's impossible to see takeshi when looking at the AT close on  See the third pic"

aS' Thanks for the review, ~VBBN~  I have to say, EF has never really caught my attention, but this set seems alright  To be honest, when I saw the topic title, I was expecting a tiger- looking mech'
p21639
aS' The mech itself is cool, except for the huge leg pieces  I think the minifigs are great in EF sets, with the dark colored outfits, like dark red or dark green '
p21640
aS' Thanks for that good review, ~VBBN~  Thats really a fine and pretty solid looking mecha'
p21641
aS' I think that the designers did a good job on this last wave of EF sets, and the inclusion of these mini robots was also a pretty smart idea!'
p21642
aS" Nice to see a well done review  This set is one of the few Exo-Force sets I haven't built myself yet, but I will get it on sale, guess soon"
p21643
aS" I'm do not like the use of Slizer-style ball-joints in Exo-Force, even though they are modified to 2x2 bricks"
p21644
aS' In this particular set I think the arms look weak, and they lack elbow joint like the "green 2008 mech" set  (forgot name of this years green mech)'
p21645
aS' Quite a shame, I find it really hurts the functionality of that "green" set and could imagine the same with the "Tiger"'
p21646
aS' I guess with the new pyramide brick as cockpit, the cockpit is still open from the sides and the back'
p21647
aS' I modified my "green 2008 mech", which use the same cockpit design, with a few green bricks, and it is now completely closed from all sides'
p21648
aS' I rate the Tiger at average, but I may change my mind when I get to build it myself  Front'
p21649
aS' This was my first Exo Force set and I was quite skeptical towards the mecha theme, so I got it because it seemed to have nice parts'
p21650
aS' It turned out however that the mechas are quite nice :) I really like the poseability of it and since then I got another EF set '

aS' If you want to increase the number of your firefighter and their equipment this is a great way, though there is something missing in my mind'
p21782
aS' The Rating System Figures: 5/10 (Fairly standard I already have a fair few) Parts 6/10 (Good selection of tools, but lacks the breathing apparatus Id expect in a set like this) Fun Fun Fun 5/10 (Theres clearly something to do even if you just own this set'

p21785
aS' This isnt a set Id necessarily buy, but while I was at Bluewater today I decided I should try to review every impulse set myself, so that why I bought it'
p21786
aS' Still I think it has some good playability and a good set of accessories if you need more firefighting kit, I just cant get passed the lack of breaking apparatus, that would have made it a better set in my view'

p22058
aS" Feels very solid as you build the pickup (compared to the Fire pickup & trailer I also have) The orange pieces (my first pieces in this colour!) The tyres which give the smoothest ride of any Lego Town/City vehicle I've ever built The raised suspension and side runners The Coast Guard dude (again a first for me) and his mega-cool flippers and aqualung The jetski controls - The handlebars actually move left to right which is a great detail Little details that Lego didn't have to do (the grey handle by the ball joint; moving handlebars; the new tyres) As you can probably guess, I have voted Outstanding for this set!

aS' Trim the large sticker that goes on the roof of the vehicle by cutting along the angles at the front of the sticker'
p22070
aS' If you use it as it is, it will extend beyond the "flat" surface of the roof and will overlap the lower sections'

aS' Anyone have any idea is there any other sets that contains this piece? The blasters: We are given a 2 long blasters which is great'
p22217
aS" Which I it is more accurate as most of the Clone troopers use a long blaster  The minifigs: The minifigs is 2 Shock Trooper but is different with #7655 clone troopers battle packs's Shock Trooper"
p22218
aS' The leg is different in colour, we are given white hip while the one in the battle pack are given a black hip'
p22219
aS' Furthermore, we get a new printed headgear, which I think they have improve it, check out the mouth printing, the colour is brighter'
p22220
aS' So here is the headgear: The headgear limit itself from turning to the side this is because the front part it is too low until it block by the torso'
p22221
aS' The Shock Troopers: Without helmet on: We are given a black stud, no face printed  How I wish that I have extra'
p22222
aS" With helmet on: Comparison with Shock Troopers from Battle Pack: The AT-AP: Here's the AT-AP  It looks ugly at a certain angle and looks great in a certain angle  Anyway I still like the set"
p22223
aS' I like the walker vehicle  Below are the pictures taken randomly: Top view: Side view: Without stabilizer leg: With stabilizer leg: Rear view: The Functions: Well, the functions are not so impressive'
p22224
aS' Just something turning around, open here and there  The only function that is say as special is the retractable stabilizer leg'
p22225
aS' The cockpit: The cockpit can fit two Clone Troopers but too bad we are only given two and is not enough as there is no gunner on top'
p22226
aS' Inside it there is a guns holders, which can hold two guns but fall off easily when you are trying to remove the guns  Well the other side have some speedometre thing and a controller'
p22227
aS' To reveal the cockpit, you have to open the top hatch'
p22228
aS" Look below: so you can see what's inside: Oops, the side hatch and back hatch as well: Open and close: I think this pieces is use not to let you open the hatch but to make some design, I mean make it able to move inside"
p22229
aS' With Clones: Beneath: So this is the pieces that hold the stabilizer leg when is not in use'
p22230
aS' This is how the stabilizer leg move: At last~ And of course the revealing cockpit from below and at the back  Guess the droids have alternative way to take this things down faster'
p22231
aS' The leg: There are pieces blocking the leg to go to the front I mean overhead and lose balance  The base in not movable The side armor: The side armor has door and this is how it is attach'
p22232
aS' It is very flimsy, when you want to adjust it to be a little steep to creat the shape, they might just fall off  So it is connected to the body with just a technic pin'
p22233
aS" and to hold it properly, here is the support: The side hatch: It open and close easily, very loose, nothing to hold it tight  Here's some view when the side hatch is open"
p22234
aS' The cannon: The cannon on top is movable and adjustable  The big cannon can move up and down while the smaller one can cove sideways'
p22235
aS' But the smaller one tend to lose balance when it is without minifigs, means the one on top and below will not b align  This is the pieces that only enable it to move up and down'
p22236
aS' To prevent it from moving freely, LEGO put two pieces to block it  Completion: I try to make the sets looks great  I think this angle is right'
p22237
aS' Spare parts: It is so few compare with #7673 Magna Guard Starfighter and it is more expensive  Overall: This set is not really a good set'
p22238
aS' The hatch is quite flimsy, top and the side since there is nothing to hold them tight  Besides, it is lack of one clone  But to complete your walker collection, you must have it'
p22239
aS' Pros: -no sticker needed -new improved headgear -long balsters Cons: -lack of clone -flimsy -expensive as few pieces are given] Hope you guys like it  Edited by KimT, 30 August 2008 - 12:01 PM '

This towering engine of mechanical destruction from the Clone Wars strides across hostile terrain on four independently positionable stilt legs, then uses its movable laser cannons to blast Republic forces'
p22303
aS' Includes Commander Fox, Clone Trooper, Battle Droid, Super Battle Droid and Battle Droid Commander minifigures! Rotate the laser cannon on top! Laser cannon underneath bends to change direction! Measures 6" (15cm) tall and 10" (27cm) wide! Also known as the homing spider droid, this is what I would usually reckon as a mini-fig set if not for the high price point'

p22481
aS'99 GBP Brickset Hello everyone, today I will review the extremely underrated Hailfire Tank and Spider Droid set  I hope this review does it justice'
p22482
aS" So, let's start with the box: NOTE: This picture is not mine  Standard box for Star Wars in that time"
p22483
aS" The background on the box looks like it's from Geonosis, indicating that this set is from Episode II, and not III or the Clone Wars"
p22484
aS' The back of the box (not shown) shows the playability functions and some other sets that were released at the same time as this  Overview Here is an overview of the whole set'
p22485
aS' It comes with one construction manual and no sticker sheets ( )'
p22486
aS' This is a very simple set, but with not much to it, it is still a very important part of the CIS army, especially if you are interested in army building'
p22487
aS' I like to call this set a "super battle pack", and you\'ll find out why soon  Let\'s get right to it, and look at the feature of the set: the Hailfire Tank  Front A front view of the very cool tank'
p22488
aS' Here you can see two triangular shields on the hull'
p22489
aS" The main body is very simple, but altogether very effective and clever, and making it really look like a hailfire tank, although a little bit sized down from it's movie version"
p22490
aS' The trans-red stud used as the "eye" makes the tank look more menacing  Side The side view  The wheels are very easy to make, but it\'s a real pain to connect all of those chain links together'
p22491
aS" I don't see what you could use the links for, except for another tank, but maybe someone creative will find something for these  The dark tan is nice though"
p22492
aS' The wheels are held on by Technic poles, and the tank rolls on the wheels fairly well on carpet or a hard surface  Back This is the back of the tank'
p22493
aS" Here you can see eight flick-fire missiles (four on each side) of the new type, so they don't easily fall out  Also note the modified 2x2 with extended hole piece sticking out of the back"
p22494
aS' This may be used to easily push around the tank  I just wish you could fit a droid in the body for the cockpit  '
p22495
aS' Now we move on to the Spider Droid, or what I like to call "The Dwarf Spider": The front  This one is also simple, but very cleverly built'
p22496
aS' The main body is two semi-spheres connected together for rotation, and an antenna, a cannon, four legs, and eyes made out of a useful telephone piece'
p22497
aS' The picture speaks for itself as far as how the gun and eyes are built  Side A side view  You can now see the legs better, which are more sturdy then you would think'
p22498
aS' Each one is made out of two pearl bronze Exo-force robot arms, a useful bley handgun piece, and a dark bley battle droid body, all connected to the under body (a big knob-like piece)  Back The back'
p22499
aS' Not much to say here  I like this spider droid because it is very sturdy, and the legs are easy to adjust'
p22500
aS' Finally, we look at the minifigs: There are four minifigs in this set, which is quite generous for a set of this size'
p22501
aS' It comes with a yellow battle droid commander (I really like this one), two battle droids, and a super battle droid  All three battle droids have the new blaster pistols and one twisted arm'
p22502
aS" That's about it for the review, so here is the FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, Very fun and easy, besides the chain links  Should take the seasoned builder less than 20 minutes"
p22503
aS' Playability: 7/10, the flick-fire missiles are fun, as well as just zooming around the tank  Could use some clones for a battle  Swooshability: 8/10, you can roll around the hailfire fairly well'
p22504
aS' Minifigs: 9/10, a generous amount of figs, and all are pretty good  Design: 9 5/10, a really simple and clever set, although a little too small for the movie version'
p22505
aS' Price: 10/10, a very fair price considering the price-per-parts ratio and the coolness of the set  Overall Score: 8'
p22506
aS'5/10, a very neat set to have, a great army builder, and great for display next to all of the other CIS sets  The price is fair, the figs are good, and the build is very clever'

p22544
aS' At first glance, this ball on legs may not seem like much, but hopefully this review will change your mind  The box'
p22545
aS' This box is the standard for all of the new Clone Wars sets: sleek, shiny, and a right-out-of-the-factory look'
p22546
aS' The blue-and-white color scheme is fantastic, and portrays that the sets are based off of a cartoon well'
p22547
aS' This box has a "LIMITED EDITION" (in Spanish, too! ) seal slapped on the front, although you won\'t have trouble finding this in your local Toys "R" Us, because of the big Clone Wars display in the front of the store that you can\'t miss'
p22548
aS' Overview In this picture, you can see the contents of the whole set (minus the instruction booklet) built'
p22549
aS" You can spot five minifigures (which I'll get to later), and a very tall CIS weapon, known as the Homing Spider Droid"
p22550
aS' This weapon of destruction is a must-have for your CIS army, although the color scheme (mostly dark bley and light bley) is a change up from the regular colors (brown or blue) of the CIS'
p22551
aS" This may have something to do with the blended armies of the Trade Federation and Corporate Alliance, but I don't know for sure  The instruction manual is very thin, only about twenty pages"
p22552
aS' Homing Spider Droid This is the main part of the set  Four huge legs, two mounted guns, and a red sensor eye are the highlights of this artillery unit'
p22553
aS" There's not many playability factors to this one, but sometimes its just fun to squash the little clones, a change-up of the contrary"
p22554
aS' It also looks good next to all of the other CIS sets, but you might want to clear some room in your display area; the legs take up a lot of room! This thing is also massively tall, about the same height as the Republic Cruiser'
p22555
aS' Main Body This is the main body of the spider, which has no cockpit and is remote controlled  This spherical body (not in that sort of way  '
p22556
aS') is a very quick build, and features a big, red eye connected by a red stud and hinge'
p22557
aS' Top Gun Here is the top gun (not with Tom Cruise), which is connected to the body using a clever Technic system (pun not intended)'
p22558
aS' As you can see from this picture, you can see that it can rotate a full 360 degrees, but only if you remove the eye'
p22559
aS' Also, the gun can be pulled back, and if you let go, it will snap back, like the a gun does when fired, due to the force of the shot'
p22560
aS" I'm not sure this was intended by TLG, because it wasn't showed anywhere on the box or in the manual  Lower Gun Here is the gun attached to the under body of the main part"
p22561
aS' It is attached using a hinge, which allows it to move up and down  I also like the cord (that presumably transfers power) included on both guns'
p22562
aS' Hips Here is one of the hips attaching the legs to the body  There is one on each side, with two legs each  The are attached to the body and legs with Technic pieces'
p22563
aS' Legs You can see the tall legs in this pic  They are basically just Technic poles and connectors  Feet This is one of the feet, the essential to balancing the whole vehicle'
p22564
aS' These and the legs are repetitive, so I suggest doing them all at the same time to avoid flipping back in the manual and repeating the process three more times'
p22565
aS' The picture speaks for itself for the design of the feet  All are connected to the legs using a double-holed Technic piece'
p22566
aS' One Massive Son of a Gun This thing is so tall! It frightens the skin off of even the toughest, most experienced soldiers'
p22567
aS" Run for your Lives!! Look at how much havoc and fear it causes! Family Photo Enough of the battle scenes, here is a shot of this spider with it's smaller cousin: the Dwarf Spider Droid"
p22568
aS' Minifigs Finally, here are the minifigs that come with this set'
p22569
aS" There are five in all, which include: Battle Droid: Nothing special, but still an addition to your army Commander Battle Droid: I love that yellow torso! Super Battle Droid: Again, nothing special Clone Trooper: I'm glad they gave us one in this set, I can add it to to my other Phase 1 clones"
p22570
aS' Commander Fox: I love it! Everything from the dark red markings to the accessories are fantastic! The head is just the regular anime style Clone Wars face'
p22571
aS' This set comes with two flashlights, two antennae, one visor, one pauldron, and one kama  Close-up of Fox Here is a close-up of Fox, so you can see the detailed insignia of the Republic Guard'
p22572
aS' That wraps it up for the review, here is the FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, very easy and straightforward, a little repetitive with the legs  Should take the seosoned builder around 20 minutes'
p22573
aS" Playability: 6/10, not many play factors, but it's fun to just squash puny clones with this giant arachnid"
p22574
aS" Swooshability: N/A Minifigs: 10/10, you really can't ask for more in this sort of set! Design: 8/10, not very sturdy, but it is altogether clever"
p22575
aS' Price: 5/10, yes, it is limited edition, but pumping up the price fifteen dollars more than it should be is a little ridiculous  Overall Score: 8'
p22576
aS'5/10, An excellent set for display, although not very sturdy  Minifigs are superb, but the price could be better'

p22619
aS" Sticker sheet: and they're numbered! Random instructions page: connecting legs to the body Instructions page - sticker detail: that's why they're numbered"
p22620
aS" Instructions page - parts inventory: does anybody check if they're all there before building? Surely not me"
p22621
aS' Loose pieces: nothing rare, I think; small Techinc parts come in different colours, as usual (you often don\'t see them when the model is complete, but sometimes you do) The Iron drone: "strong and durable" (and much better looking than those crappy MM jelly aliens) Building starts'
p22622
aS' The open cockpit - front and rear view Left leg - front and rear view; right leg is built of the same pieces'
p22623
aS' Left arm - with laser cannon The cannon - great use of the hollow studs with the "Plant Tree Palm Top" Right arm - with twin missiles Complete model - front view Complete model - side view and rear view Rating and review'
p22624
aS" Parts and building: nothing new, but both models are O K  Instead of waiting the last page of the manual, you'd better put the stickers in place while building"
p22625
aS" Looking at the box you'd tell stickers background is (trans) purple  It actually is trans clear (excpet for the yellow and black stripes - warning: hazard!)"

aS' Try not to put your fingerprints on the sticky side! Consider using tweezers'
p22627
aS" Posability: both legs and both arms feature three joints; and that's good, so that the weight doesn't have the Sentry falling down"
p22628
aS' Final model: smaller compared to 2007 Claw Crusher and 2008 Batlle Arachnoid, but cheaper and surely worth the money  The "minifig" is just another Iron drone, not much to say'
p22629
aS' Final rating: 3,5/5 Edited by Sinner, 01 September 2008 - 02:22 AM '
p22630
aS' Thanks for the review  I really do like the first year of EF  Nowadays they mecha are perhaps more cleverly designed, and use ball joints for playability'
p22631
aS" But I really love the blocky bulky look of the first Drone's machines  And somehow the older ones seem a better value of parts  I'm more inclined to buy duplicates of them than the newer models "

p22646
aS' It was something completely new and different for Lego as no mini-fig scale sets and/or adventurers had ever ventured to the Arctic'
p22647
aS' The set offered new orange pieces and combined elements of blue and white pieces to provide a number of sleds, vehicles, a mobile outpost (6520), and even a large polar base (6575)'
p22648
aS' The theme was unfortunately short lived and did not see 2001  This particular set is a "value pack" that combines sets 6578 (Polar Explorer) and 6586 (Polar Scout) at a reasonable price of $10 (USD)'
p22649
aS' I may have even paid a few dollars less at a discount toy store back in the early 2000s'
p22650
aS' A picture of the "Bonus Pack" with the two sets combined within the box: The backside features an advertisement for the Lego Club and pictures of other Arctic sets: Starting with the smaller set, The Polar Explorer (just a tip of the iceberg ): Instructions Front of Box Back of Box Both sets include the same minifig, an Arctic fig with glasses and a thick arctic coat: Here\'s a shot of the fig with his hood on'
p22651
aS' I always thought the hood is a nice piece that would work well for Hoth Rebel snow scenes'

aS' On a slightly random note I do know that at least one Lego minifig did make it all the way to the real artic with a research team, sadly I dont have any pictures to offer you '

p22896
aS'99 Year: 2008 I think many people were deterred from this set because of the low piece count and a high price for it although it does come with 4 minfigures  1  Overall set and figs Official box pic'
p22897
aS' This indicates it is a Geonosis set from the background but it is no different from any other set same old brown separatist ship/s  The whole set'
p22898
aS' Some red tan droids would have been nice like in the Geonosian fighter set  All the minifigs  The super battle droid body is slightly different to the one in the BP  It looks more grainy and silver'
p22899
aS" I doubt this has any relevance for it being a geonosis set but I like them better how they were in the BP's The Super Battle droid body dwarfing the commander droids body"
p22900
aS' I think that the new Commander droids body is better than the old one with just the yellow strip even though it is less accurate  New twisted Battle Droid arm, each droid has one of these'
p22901
aS" I don't really like having droids with these new guns I think the older guns suited them much better  2  Hailfire Droid Hailfire droid by itself  It is certainly smaller than the original"
p22902
aS" Seeming as this is the main part of the set I was hoping it would be bigger but I don't mind it being this small too much"
p22903
aS' Wheels and rockets can fold outwards and inwards The wheels which spin round two large clear discs and made from loads of these tiny links'
p22904
aS' This is probably the best way to make the wheels on this small scale'
p22905
aS" The only other alternatives I can think of are using the tracks from the Wookiee Attack set or catterpilla tracks, both of which wouldn't look right  One of the missile pods"
p22906
aS" These use the new flick-fire missiles which don't fall out are an excellent idea"
p22907
aS' They should have come with the purple cones like on the Magna guards staffs instead of red though because in the film the missiles are purple'
p22908
aS" One of the new flickfire missiles that don't drop out when the model is tilted forward  I don't know what the holes in them are for though"
p22909
aS' The 3 "eyes" are made up of 2 trans red cheese bricks for the sides and 1 trans red stud for the center You can also see how the missile pods are attached to the side of the body'
p22910
aS' This is the back of the Hailfire Droid  There is a plate with a hole in, I have found only one purpose for this'
p22911
aS' The Hailfire Droid is the Commander droids war chariot! What do you use the plate for? 3  Spider Droid The Spider Droid  The design has been greatly improved from the Wookiee attack set'
p22912
aS' Not only is it more accurate but also more poseable which is useful when setting up battle scenes'
p22913
aS" The ball joint provides the place to put the antenna which isn't long enough but the dome form the old set looks more like the droid form Star wars Episode II"
p22914
aS' The eyes are made of a telephone piece with 2 trans red studs on  In the original it had orange studs  The eyes can be seen in action 2 pics down  I told you it was a telephone  1 of 4 identical legs'
p22915
aS' These are very easy to adjust into what ever position you want and are much better than the originals'
p22916
aS' But a word of warning never pull them apart as I did they become very loose when put back together so I put some blue tack in the holes  4 Overall Build: 7/10 A little to repetitive for my liking'

aS" Minifigs: 8/10 4 figs for 20 isn't too bad plus they come with new guns  Design: 9/10 Both vehicles are very well designed but the hailfire's small size let the set down"

aS' The front of the torso is great, featuring shoulder straps, armor plating, and a life support system'
p22968
aS' While this minifig is not altogether accurate to the movie, it has still been one of my favorite Star Wars figs  Back The back of the fig that can double as the front of clone marines'
p22969
aS' This side features shoulder straps and armor plating  Cockpit Lastly, here is the pilot seated in the cockpit  He fits perfectly, although it is not air-tight'
p22970
aS" We wouldn't want the poor guy to suffocate, now would we? That wraps up the review, here is the FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, a nice, easy, build, and the last of the small SW ships ($10 or less)"
p22971
aS" Playability: 6/10, pretty fun to swoosh around, but that's about it  Could use a vulture droid, but that would take away the 'small' factor"
p22972
aS' Swooshability: 10/10, very fun and easy to swoosh around endlessly, without fear of it breaking  Minifigs: 9/10, there really is no need to have more, although a Palpy fig would be outstanding'
p22973
aS" The pilot is a great figure though  Design: 9/10, extremely accurate to the movie, but the cockpit is not airtight  Price: 10/10, you couldn't ask for a better deal! Overall Score: 8"
p22974
aS'6, an excellent set  Unfortunately, this is the last of the small SW ships currently  The fig is great, and the sleek design is accurate'

aS' This was one of the first sets I bought from the new Castle theme and I love it  So many figs and awesome skeleton horses in just one set'

aS" It's a small battle wagon with blades on the front, probably to demolish rocks in mines"
p23390
aS' But in this case, our hero dwarf has to use his machine against the evil trolls who want to destroy his happy kingdom'
p23391
aS' There is only one small booklet for instructions, no alternate model: Parts come in two bags, one for small pieces and one for bigger ones: Apart from the lovely figures, the brown parts will be quite useful for any castle builder'
p23392
aS" Extra parts are not even worth mentioning, there are no stickers: Figures are detailed enough, dwarf is lovely with his beard but his legs won't move because he is short: Figures are the main attraction for adult players"
p23393
aS" We haven't seen castle army builder sets for a long while and this is closest we've got in recent years"
p23394
aS" The dwarf is a little taller than it should have been but it's not possible to do so without creating a completely new mould for figures and that would be expensive"
p23395
aS' Its beard is oversized as well but that gives him a Legoish look which I like a lot'

p23398
aS' There are not enough weapons to arm everyone but the flag pole is really nice: Unlike the Star Wars army builders, this set has very little weaponry'
p23399
aS" Only one sword and one pike creates scarcity for 3 figures - Star Wars sets had 4 figures for same price! So I hope our middle age warriors don't come across any stormtroopers :) Building in progress: When you pull the chain the catapult fires a round brick: The set has quite good playability, moving blades and firing catapult should be fun for little children"

p23434
aS' While I was studying for exams a few weeks back I decided to take a break, built the monorail and take some pictures of it  Resulting in the present review  Along with this I made my first ever poll'
p23435
aS" Here we go: First, some data: Setnumber: 6399 Setname: Airport Shuttle Released in: 1990 in Holland, though Bricklink says 1991 Number of parts: 731 Number of figs: 9 Price: unknown, prices on Bricklink vary from $261 up to $2300 (!) but this was an expensive set even in the nineties The box: Mine is a bit battered by the owner before me, but there's still plenty to see"
p23436
aS' This is one of the largest boxes I have (look at the minifig in the down-right corner for the comparision) and it is a really neat storing facility for many sets'
p23437
aS' The box shows the set, and in the background the silhouet of the set that is to accompany this one: the airport from 1990'
p23438
aS' I like the angle of the box, showing the two stations, track and train in one picture'
p23439
aS" The back of the box shows some really nice ideas for other setups, why oh why has Lego abandonned this kind of showing what's possible with one set  "
p23440
aS'? Inside flap of the box, showing details of the set and the functions, Detail on the front of the box, displaying the dimensions, it really is a huge track layout for one set! The instructions: there is a nice little booklet showing the same picture as the box art with the figures lined up underneath'
p23441
aS' The last page nicely folds out to show the entire setup of the tracks, The figures: A brilliant selection of minifigs including airport people and a cook'
p23442
aS' All figures that are supposed to go on the shuttle carry a ticket and there are also some suitcases (tickets fit inside, of course) Station # 1: The set includes two stations'
p23443
aS' Here is the first, depicting the airport  There are lots of details: a phonebooth, two seats, some flowers, a map, luggagelockers and of course the streetlights'
p23444
aS' A detailed shot of the station showing the luggagelockers and ticket-validating machine, Part of the beauty of this set is the fact that it is so extremely detailed, just look at the signs to show where to go next (stickers), and the scenery opposite the street'
p23445
aS'   The station has the same shape as the Airport Shuttle logo, how sweet is that? The station pictured as part of the layout'
p23446
aS' The stations ends are made with airplane wings to smoothen the arrival of the shuttle'
p23447
aS' Station # 2: Here is the second station, my personal favorite: An elevated stop with a little snackbar underneath and stairs leading to the platform'
p23448
aS' Some chairs and streetlights here as well plus two old fashioned trees, The part of the set that can be used in any layout: the snackbar with hamburger sign (sticker)'
p23449
aS' Yes, those hamburgers look tasty indeed! Also notice the lights hanging from the platform overhead and the ticket-validating machine at the bottom of the stairs'
p23450
aS" Here we have the platform with information panels and seats  Also notice the two trafficlights for the train  Here's how it works: the train will travel in the direction the arrow is pointing"
p23451
aS" When turning the knob the two grey blocks will move towards or away from the track-center, activating a button on the centerpiece of the train (the motor) which makes the train start it's journey around the track"
p23452
aS' There is only one speed and the train can only be put to a stop or change direction at stations  The station as part of the layout'
p23453
aS' The Shuttle: Now on with the train: There are two carrriages connected to a centered motor  the power is provided by means of a batterybox containing a 9v battery'
p23454
aS' The batterybox is in one of the carriages and displays: Airport Shuttle  A total of five passengers can be seated inside leaving room for their luggage and two drivers'
p23455
aS' The front carriage with the button for the batterybox showing  The underside showing the gearwheel (metal) that brings the power from the motor onto the geared track'
p23456
aS' The black pointy things alongside the gear-wheel react with the direction knobs at stations'
p23457
aS' This is how the shuttle negociates with height differences, everything hinges and rotates, making the shuttle capable of performing steep climbs'
p23458
aS' The motor is powerful enough to not slow down at such a climb! Detailed shot, showing the first set of covered wheels in hinged position  The shuttle on the layout'
p23459
aS' The full layout: This layout is quite huge, involving lots of track pieces, ramps, ten large stanchion-poles and the two stations'
p23460
aS' To show the movement of the shuttle I have made a 20 second movie, which can be seen in My Brickshelf gallery of this set'
p23461
aS' Conclusion: Well, to conclude the review, some final thoughts: This truly is one of the more detailed sets around (at least from the nineties) and one of the largest in dimensions'
p23462
aS' The monorail system is cleverly thought out and works excellent  Track extensions are hard to get however and very expensive nowdays (especially the switchpoints and long straight track pieces)'
p23463
aS' The tracks included with this set will provide you with hours of fun though, because there are a lot of them'
p23464
aS' It can be quite hard to incorporate the monorail in your town without having a clearly-based-on-the-monorail-alone town  I tried to incorporate it some years ago (link here), posing a real challenge'
p23465
aS' The Ratings: Price: 8/10: this is an expensive set, if you can get it for under $200 get it!), this set is rare in any condition'
p23466
aS' Parts: 10/10: lots of rare pieces, cool minifigs, 9v system, roadplates, lots of minifigseats en red trainwindows'
p23467
aS' Originality: 10/10: there are very few monorails released, this one being the only town set'
p23468
aS' Compatibility: 8/10: can be a bit hard to incorporate in a town, but hey: you got the monorail so no complaining here! Total: 36/40: I can only reccommend this set to anyone, It is my personal favorite set upto this present time! If there are any questions, ask them, all comments are welcome of course!'
p23469
aS' You chose the perfect set for your first poll, Simon! No question this set is one of the all-time-beauties  I rated outstanding of course'
p23470
aS' I never hat the chance to get a complete copy of this set, but I do own the engine and quite a bunch of monorail tracks  Your very detailed review made me think of getting the whole set some day'
p23471
aS' Thank you very much for this! I never realized there were so many details included to this set: The snackbar and the telephone cell and all the other nice things'
p23472
aS' Really strange for a nineties set which often lacked details  The only thing that comes to my mind right now is that the engine looks quite blocky'
p23473
aS' If the set was released today, TLC would use more of those parts which make a better design imo  And it would fit better to the curved walls of the stations as well'
p23474
aS' [wishful thinking]How much would I love to see the monorail system back again! [/wishful thinking] I had to lough when reading your comment on the minifig seats'

p23476
aS" I got this set last month and I can definitely say that even if you think it is one of the best sets ever, you won't fully appreciate it until you build it yourself"
p23477
aS' The elevated city station is much more complex than it looks, and the whole set is extremely detailed'
p23478
aS" The good: - As stated in the review, there's a lot of track, roughly twice as much as the last monorail made, 6991"
p23479
aS" 5 long straights too! - the designers didn't need to put in the hamburger stand or the ticket readers, but they did and made it even better - Great figure selection; airport workers as well as civilians The bad (if you can call it that in such a great set): - Hard to incorporate into an existing town if using the default track layout"
p23480
aS' The center loop would be inaccessible to vehicles and the layout is very large'
p23481
aS' - The monorail needs nearly a full straight section on either side of the city station or it will impact the corner of the station and stall if a curve is too close'
p23482
aS" - As far as I know the only town set with road plates that doesn't have a wheeled vehicle  A car would have been nice, a bus would have been incredible"

aS' This is an outstanding review which deserved to be featured here! After seeing this set, it prompts me to own this set, and match with my 10159 LEGEND City Airport'
p23485
aS" It's very nice to see such outstanding set being reviewed and presented to our very screens  Everything about this set is simply outstanding"
p23486
aS" I can't imagine that such incredible set actually released before"
p23487
aS" Why don't they ever continue with this anymore? Sigh, it's nice to see so much detailed from its shuttle, snack bar, stairs, waiting platform, validating machine and etc"
p23488
aS' This is an instant "5" set! If given a chance to own a MISB set, I will defintely seriously consider about it '
p23489
aS' Best  Set  Ever  I got my copy years ago from a guy on the old rec toys lego newsgroup (anybody here still remember that newsgroup??)'
p23490
aS" I traded him a Guarded Inn, a Black Falcon's Fortress, and a couple other small castle sets for it  No regrets on that trade"
p23491
aS' It is hard to incorporate a monorail into a town, especially if you have a bunch of trains too! I ended up making my entire monorail system elevated'
p23492
aS" There's just no easy way to make a monorail / road crossing  I also gave up on having it run in a loop  Instead, it runs back and forth between two endpoints "
p23493
aS'An excellent review of one of the jewels in the crown of the Lego town range, to answer one of your question I think the lack of people owning this set is one of the reasons that its yet to have a review'
p23494
aS' Personally Ive only seen this set in the flesh once in my life when I was a child just before it was withdrawn from sale'
p23495
aS' It is a lovely set, well made and well produced though I think there is a flaw and thats when the passages get of the other end of their train ride what picks them up, a bus set for the airport would have been a good addition'
p23496
aS' Apart from that I cant really fault it and that fact it comes with three female minifigs is just stellar  As for incorporation, keeping it elevated seems the most sensible suggestion'
p23497
aS' Ive always thought it I have it and wanted to integrate the set to a town to use it in the style of the DLR in London, but thats just a thought '

aS' INDEXED Name: Refuse Collection Truck Set No'
p23600
aS': 6693 Theme: LEGO System / Town Year: 1987 Pieces: 103 Minifigs: 2 Price: unknown Special parts: 4215ap08 (Yellow Panel 1 x 4 x 3 with Recycling Pattern), just occurs in this set (2x)'
p23601
aS' 4598 (Red Bracket 2 x 3 - 2 x 2), occurs only in this set and only one other set'
p23602
aS' This truck was introduced in the same year that LEGO came up with the garbage bins that of course also appear in this set'
p23603
aS' Have you ever wondered why most of the time the streets of LEGO City are so clean and neat? No litter, no garbage everywhere, no chewinggum on the streets'
p23604
aS' Even with so many different inhabitants, it seems to always stay that way'
p23605
aS' However, the older AFOLs amongst us, have experienced totally different situations: rubbish everywhere, smelly and dirty looking pavements, minifigs that were losing their standard grin'
p23606
aS' That is why LEGO came out with this magnificent truck back in 1987  Before that, people needed to put there garbage in bags or maybe barrels'
p23607
aS' From that year on, every miniman and miniwoman is happily using a trash bin'
p23608
aS' The minifig civil servants never seem to become tired and the Garbage truck comes every other day to collect the rubbish and keep the city clean'
p23609
aS" The secret behind the clean LEGO city and the always happy 'standard grin' of our minifolks are the anti-litter warriors that use their powerful machines and handy tools to just get the job done! So if you don't own a garbage truck, better try to get one, before your standard grins also fade and your streets become as dirty as Naples (where the garbage collectors recently had a strike for quite some time)"
p23610
aS" An overview of the set including instructions (actually one is included in the set)  Unfortunately I afraid we don't have any boxes of this set left  Another image of the LEGO items in the set"
p23611
aS' It shows the truck, two civil servants to perform the waste collection duties, two garbage bins and a broom and shovel'
p23612
aS' The two chaps that always seem to smile, even when the litter that they collect really stinks  The accessories that accompany the set'
p23613
aS' A broom and a shovel to help cleaning up in case a dustbin tips over'
p23614
aS' A very nice feature of the set is that the elevator at the back can be lifted in more or less the same way that real garbage trucks do'
p23615
aS" As you can see here, the dustbin is emptied through a red 'train window'  (It seems to be that the hinges of my version will need some 'revision'"
p23616
aS') Panels inside the back of the truck maximize waste capacity for this 4 stud wide truck  It is nice that the designers added this simple red round brick on a clip'
p23617
aS' Presumably it should depict cylinders to let the back compartment tip for emptying or otherwise it might be gastanks  Again the complete set'
p23618
aS' It is very complete set but some additions could make it even more playable: - garbage (e g'
p23619
aS' a green flower bottom or some round plates 1 x 1) - a place for the second worker to position himself on, when the trucks needs to drive to the dumpsite or an other street and also vertical bars for that second worker to hold himself by'
p23620
aS' This is what the truck will look like when dumping the litter at the recycle plant or dump site, the whole back nicely tilts, so that all the litter will fall out of the truck'
p23621
aS' A view on the back of the truck  Quite a small but yet effective opening  The front of the truck'
p23622
aS' Only one seat for just the driver, but I personally prefer that to a 6 wide truck that fills the total width of the streets and has problems with corners'
p23623
aS' Of course set 7991 (The orange garbage truck of last year) is also nice, we also own some of those but we never put them in our LEGO Town since they take too much room and the color scheme of 6693 is also more preferable to us'
p23624
aS' The two panels with the printed recycling pattern are a bit worn so we might recreate the recycle logo and put it on a sticker some day'
p23625
aS" Playability: 8/10 (Like I mentioned it is too bad that the set doesn't have any litter [however LEGO also saw that and has put litter in the 6693 set]) Design: 9/10 (a really nice truck with two minifigs and very nice details) Price: -/10 (I was not able to get any price information, at bricklink one can still obtain a 2nd hand one for about 25$"
p23626
aS") Overall: 8/10 (a set that should be entitled a 'classic' in the same list as the pizza restaurants, the 7750 and the blacksmith shop) That was all the pictures I was allowed to take since it seems that those brave man still have quite some trash cans to empty"
p23627
aS' Thanks guys for doing the dirty work so our minifigs stay happy and our streets stay clean! Peeron Lugnet Brickset: Bricklink entries Additional notes on the review: My brother has always been keen on garbage trucks'
p23628
aS" However when he became aware of this truck it wasn't available in the stores anymore  Newer sets that had the 'recycling theme' we not that good  They didn't have the emptying mechanism"
p23629
aS' So after our dark ages, one of the first sets we bought, were some of those nice refuse collection trucks'
p23630
aS' Although the new orange truck has the desired mechanisms and thankfully is a decent garbage truck, we more like 4 wide trucks than 6 studs wide trucks, so for the years to come our LEGO town inhabitants will still be seeing this great truck to control their waste problems'

p23662
aS' Having two minifigs is a superior point for this earlier Lego rendition of a bin lorry'
p23663
aS' In fact, even though our bins are now emptied by a private company rather than the local council (as was the case up till the mid 90s), and of course for the last two decades there have been wheelie-bins, bin lorries have three guys - the driver and two collectors'
p23664
aS" However, our bin collectors for sure don't use a broom or shovel! Indeed on occasion they've befouled the street themselves if something goes wrong with hoisting the bin on the mechanism! The shape of the lorry in the set is still quite accurate, pretty good for a four-wide vehicle (I must admit to preferring the newer vehicles)"

p23689
aS"99 EUR/ Theme: Star Wars: Episode VI Year Released: 2006 Brickset Folder Bricklink Catalog Welcome to my ninth review the boards, today's review is the long awaited TIE Interceptor"
p23690
aS" But does it live up to expectations? Well, let's find out  I believe this is the first and only time TLG made this set  So, let's begin the review"
p23691
aS" The box The box is standard for it's time, with silver font  The background on the front has some planets and the Death Star II, clarifying that this set is from episode VI"
p23692
aS' Overview This set comes with the Interceptor model and one fig  The Interceptor has a very sleek, futuristic design, with four wings and a ball-shaped cockpit'
p23693
aS" The TIE Interceptor is a stealthy, speedy vehicle in the Imperial fleet  It is used for scouting missions, and not meant for attacking due to it's weak structure and low arsenal"
p23694
aS' Front This version of the TIE group is very attractive and cool-looking  It has an aerodynamic shape, giving it looks and speed'
p23695
aS' While not accurate to the movie\'s grey and black colored TIEs, the blue in place of the grey is just fine, and does not alter the "coolness" of the design'
p23696
aS" Thankfully, there are no stickers in this set  Cockpit Here you can see the ball-shaped cockpit  Be very, very careful when opening it; it's very flimsy and breaks off almost every time"
p23697
aS" Fortunately, both the windshield and the dish on top are printed, and not stickers  Please don't mind the dust  Cockpit Interior This is the inside of the cockpit"
p23698
aS' It is very roomy, airtight, and one of the few cockpits in SW sets that are this good  It makes up for lack of detail by giving the pilot plenty of room, so you should have no trouble there'
p23699
aS' It is also very smooth in the back and where the windshield folds down'
p23700
aS' This is by far the best SW cockpit I have ever seen done by TLG, good job! The only bad thing is the two tan bricks that clash with the rest of the color'
p23701
aS' Wing attachment This is how the wings are attached to the cockpit on each side  Unfortunately, the design on this part is not so good, and sometimes the wings break off'
p23702
aS' Plus, this part is very blocky, and there is a big juniorized piece on the base of the wings  Wings Here is what each wing looks like  There are three parts on each wing: a middle and two fins'
p23703
aS' The wings are very aerodynamic, with a diamond-like design  Note the Imperial insignias and the blue tiles lining the wings'
p23704
aS" Wing attachments cont'd Here, again, you see how the middle wing part is attached to the base (juniorized piece), and the fins attached to the base by hinges"
p23705
aS' The hinges allow the fins to fold in and out a bit, but again, this is very fragile, and the fins often break off'
p23706
aS' Gun placements This is an example of four guns on the ship, one on the tip of each fin'
p23707
aS' The guns consist of a tile with a Tenic tunnel hole on the bottom attached to a Technic pin, which is attached to a black bar  A good design altogether  Back Here you see the rear of the cockpit'
p23708
aS' You can see why the opening mechanism is so flimsy: the whole top and front is connected to the body only by a weak hinge system, as seen in the picture'
p23709
aS' Also note the small, trans-blue dish and the four trans-red studs  Minifigure Finally, here is the single figure that comes in this set, a TIE Pilot'
p23710
aS' It is an all black figure, with a life support system decal on the front and a helmet with silver Imperial insignias'
p23711
aS' An overall good minifig, with a different helmet mold than the Stormtrooper or Shadowtrooper'
p23712
aS" Well, I suppose that's about all, let's get to the FINAL VERDICT: Build: 6/10, a little difficult due the flimsiness of the ship, but should only take the average builder no more than 30 minutes"
p23713
aS" Playability: 7/10, it's fun to fly around ( ), but has no real functions  Swooshability: 7/10, you can swoosh it around fairly well, just be careful not to accidentally break it"
p23714
aS' Minifigs: 8/10, a good fig, although having only one leaves something more to be desired  Design: 4/10, very, very flimsy with the wings, windshield, and fins, but good for display'
p23715
aS" Price: 7/10: I think it was actually 30 USD when I got it, but I'm not sure    Overall Score: 6 5, an average set  Very delicate, so much that you can hardly pick it up, but good for display"
p23716
aS' The minifig is okay, and having no stickers is good  I would recommend this to a hardcore OT fan'
p23717
aS" That wraps it all up, please vote your opinion on this set in the poll, and I'll see you next review! Edited by JimButcher, 15 September 2008 - 03:10 AM "

aS'50$ (which equals about EUR 19,26 and GBP 15,57) Introduction: One of the sets that especially my cousin likes is this one'
p23752
aS' One time at the Dutch LEGOWorld event we had three of those there with flashing lights and loud sirens trying to put out the fire that was caused by the crash of again some LEGO aircraft'
p23753
aS' We never had this set before our drak ages and the sets probably came from ebay or so'
p23754
aS' In my opinion the newest Airport rescue is nice too but in the conclusion I will make some additional remarks about that'
p23755
aS" Just imagine what it would be like for your LEGO town if the pilot of one of your smaller planes, just couldn't stop before the end of the runway"
p23756
aS' Here you see the disaster that happened some day in our town: Fortunately all passengers got out safely thanks to our brave fire fighters'
p23757
aS' This magnificent truck was used to help putting out the fierce fire caused by the aviation gas from the small plane  The set includes two firefighters in distinguishable airport uniforms'
p23758
aS' In order to be able to safe the passengers and go for a quick intervention, our brave firemen have an axe for each of them, airtanks and a portable fire extinguisher'
p23759
aS' Here you see the truck on the right side  The large spout on the roof really makes it a remarkable truck'
p23760
aS' As you can see, behind the red door, there is space for the airtank of our brave firemen, at the right there is also place for the small hand held extinguisher'
p23761
aS' The left side of the truck has a water hose instead  For a truck from 1991 there is quite some room inside  Actually both firemen fit inside  Unfortunately there is only one seat'
p23762
aS' At the back there are two clips for the axes  There you can also find the main switch for the light and sound system  As you can see, the red flashing lights, do their job quite well'
p23763
aS' The sirene is just behind the bar with the flashing lights  The main spout just seems to begin emitting water  The front of the truck  For some reason there are two hidden spouts there as well'
p23764
aS' What their purpose is seems unclear but they look nice  KimT suggests that it is for foaming the runway and that is a real option of course'
p23765
aS' This set can be found on: Peeron Lugnet Brickset Bricklink entries Playability: 8/10 (Very nice set, details that are movable and of course the light and sound) Design: 8/10 (nice sets with nice details, but could have even been better: seat for 2nd fireman missing, no oxigen masks and only one airtank) Price: 7/10 (For a light and sound set and two firefighters, the price is reasonable I would say'
p23766
aS') Overall: 8/10 (nice sets, some details could even be better, too bad that there is only a five to choose from a sticker when you have more than one truck) Last but not least an overview of the complete set including instructions'
p23767
aS' "Fire mastered" as the Dutch firefighters will say when they have completed their job  We have also bought the newer airport rescue truck (7891)  However we think this 6440 one is much better'
p23768
aS' The light and sound, all the nice features and the nice details are much better than the new truck  Edited by JopieK, 11 September 2008 - 10:25 AM '

p23807
aS" (Most Interesting Piece): it's SNOT time! Building starts: and it's fast and easy Notes: car has doors! and that black plate with rail helps so that the roof doesn't only weight on the windscreen"

p23809
aS' Do you remember when Lego cars had doors? It seems so long ago  '
p23810
aS" The car is simple; but as well as a set can be designed, this one doesn't look so realistic (isn't it what Lego has been doing over the last few years? Going realistic?) Doc is OK, but I guess many people would have wanted a female fig (and: brown eyebrows with black hair? that's odd ) As I said, no Red Cross, but a politically correct Caduceus on the roof and sides"
p23811
aS' Extra pieces: 1 small antenna and 1 1x1 decorated tile  Overall, a cheap way to own a doctor minifig and a nice vehicle to add to your town  Just above average  Rating: 3 5/5'

p23832
aS" since they didn't have a construction site like nowadays, they released these small road-works"
p23833
aS" I was only six years old and really into small sets since my ADHD didn't allow me to sit and build for long periods of time  So these smaller sets were ideal for me  The instruction booklet"
p23834
aS" The complete set  The set itself is not really a surprise to set up and play with  First you'll build the smaller parts of the set like the container and the small verhicle"
p23835
aS' No real surprises there, except for the smaller car that fits perfectly in the cargo container  Just pull off the seat and steering wheel, and the car just fits'
p23836
aS" The crane itself is just as easy to build as the smaller parts  just place bricks on top of eachother  Although you'll still have the wire to connect and pull through a diversity of bricks and plates"
p23837
aS' The carco container and small car  Being out of my dark ages really tunnelled my vision toward bigger sets and completing my town'
p23838

p23839

p23853
aS" It's one of the most amazing older city sets, thus making it a really valuable review  This is the story about four handsome firemen living in one of the most amazing city structures out there"
p23854
aS" The 6389 Fire control center  The box I actually didn't remember the box to be that small"
p23855
aS" (Borrowed from Peeron) The four hunky firemen Oh jeah what women doesn't like a man in a uniform The manual Even the manual is aging  "
p23856
aS" but then again it's 17 years old! Review As you all know a city must have some standard civil services, like a hospital and a police station  A fire house also is a must for any lego city"
p23857
aS' This particular fire house is one of the most amazing sets ever to be released'
p23858
aS" In this cool set you get 4 minifigs, all fire fighters, two verhicles, and a helicopter Firefighters have to move around The futuristic fire truck is definately my favourite! Chief's car The smallest verhicle of the set, it's a small all-terrain jeep for the fire chief"
p23859
aS' pretty much a standard car in those days  a real simple layout, and a trunk which holds a small fire hose'
p23860
aS" It's lucky to be in this set, because it complements the whole thing The car Luckily it's red and it has de cool signs on the side"
p23861
aS' Helicopter Another great addition to the whole set is the helicopter  Again in a basic setup for that kind of verhicle at the time'
p23862
aS' This one has the nice addition of two hoses to put out the fires raging in lego city'
p23863
aS" The chopper No, it doesn't really fly Really cool fire truck thingy This fire truck is definately the best of the verhicles in this set  It's actually a futuristic model of fire trucks"
p23864
aS" I haven't seen any other fire truck like this  I saw a police truck like it though"
p23865
aS" but we're talking fire fighters right? Actually the whole thing han open up to reveal a number of fire fighting appliances such as a hose, a computer, and a oxygen tank"
p23866
aS' The fire truck click for bigger version! The main building actually looks kinda empty when the trucks and chopper are gone  However, this still is realistic compared to a real fire house'
p23867
aS' Also the front has those amazing sliding doors, which make this thing really look cool and clean'
p23868
aS' Off to fight a fire Main structure, with the slinding doors pulled down Actually those sliding doors are also the hard part of the model'
p23869
aS" Since all the bricks must be perfectly aligned, or else the doors will stutter  But if you're a little familiar with lego then you don't need to worry"
p23870
aS" From the back Enough room to play with I'm going to give my perspectives on each of the sides On the left we have the garage for the bigger fire truck"
p23871
aS" The only real flaw about this set is that this garage isn't long enough for the fire truck  This could have been solved by making it two or three studs longer"
p23872
aS" Notice the cool sunroof! In the middle we have the chief's office  complete with coffee machine, a diversity of computers, and a tape recorder, most likely to tape any incoming calls"
p23873
aS' A lot of details are crammed up in there  just like in the rest of the set  To the right is the helicopter platform'
p23874
aS" I really like the grey-blue-yellow of the platform because it doesn't look so red anymore"
p23875
aS" Don't get me wrong, red is a cool color, but not too much red! And the helicopter actually fits, and stays in place during playtime  The baseplate filled up This picture says it all"
p23876
aS' Again the four lego hunks are greeting all the ladies The minifigs are from a classic series, this happens with more of my lego sets'
p23877
aS' Bottom line is that this set is one of the best fire houses lego created  Verdict The build is pretty easy but takes a while to really see where you are with your building'
p23878
aS" It's nice to have a hospital from the same era, this create a more uniform look to your city  once you completed the model your baseplate is pretty filled up but still has a lot of opportunities"
p23879
aS" Playability: 10/10 (cool trucks, a chopper, and sliding doors, nuff said!) Design: 9/10 (insanely good design) Price: 10/10 (couldn't get better than this) Overall: 9"
p23880
aS'6/10 with a score like that one can only say    get one    NOW! Time to go home The trucks and chopper back on their rightful spots'
p23881
aS' I have this one  The newer 6571 station is better in some ways, but I always liked the big airport-style fire engine in this and the windows covering the garages'
p23882
aS' One mod project I have in mind is to expand the base, adding a second room in the area beneath the control center  Interestingly, this set had two different box pictures'
p23883
aS' There was the original 1989 yellow Legoland box and a 1991 blue System box, and the blue box has the vehicles in different places  Quote Price: USD $85'
p23884

aS" This is the whole model at step 5 Just attach the steering mechanism and wheels and you're done Total: The worst alternate model of the complete set"
p23930
aS" Just a boring 4/10 3rd Model: Balance Very original small model  It's a small model of a working classic Balance"
p23931
aS" And it works with small parts laid on the scales, altough they've got just a 4x4 Footprint  IT's a fast build  just 15 minutes and you've done it  The model as it looks at step 3 Finished"
p23932
aS' Easy build with just 63pcs out of 180 Total: Very original model, it actually works with small weights, but a very simple build'
p23933
aS" Still a 7/10 Alternate Model: Tractor with equipment This is the second model  It's a simple but boxy design featuring a harrow and a plough"
p23934
aS' The tractor has a similar design to the very first tractor set, but much smaller  The plough is about 24-wide and the harrow is completely SNOTTED even back in 1983'
p23935
aS' Has two functions: Working steering and the coupler for the equipment  Uses almost all pieces of the set'
p23936
aS" The tractor at step 8, the steering isn't completely attached now This is the completed tractor The complete harrow Finished alternate with the plough attached"
p23937
aS' Total: Nice, but quite ugly and boxy design for a tractor with 4 wheels of the same size'
p23938
aS' Takes me to a 6/10 Main Model: Desert Racer This is the main model, with a nice (for early 80s) but boxy design  It has two functions'
p23939
aS" Steering and a working 1-cylinder rear engine, which is of the old 2x2 piston type, since the small piston design wasn't invented back then"
p23940
aS" This is the only model of the set, which has piece callouts in the instructions  The printed alternate model has no callouts, they weren't invented on both models back in 1983"
p23941
aS' The three smaller photo instruction alternates have a piece callout at the beginning showing all needed pieces  The seat is a nice, but blocky design and use a primitive SNOT technique'
p23942
aS' This is the model at step five  The piston is already attached  Imagine this state on step 5 in modern sets'
p23943
aS' Back then LEGO had challenging instructions, not the step madness like today This is the engine just made of plates with a hole in the middle for the piston Step 9  The piston engine is completed'
p23944
aS" On step 12 the roll bar and the seat are installed  Only the steering isn't completed yet  Front view of the finished model  Just 15 steps needed back then"
p23945
aS" Bird's eye view of the whole set Displayed on the box Model Verdict: Nice design, especially the colorful seat in SNOT technique, but quite boxy especially the engine, since there were only the huge pistons"
p23946
aS' Still a 9/10 Set Verdict: Design and Models: 7/10, very boxy designs, due to the age  The chassis alternate sucks Build: 9/10 Classic 80s technic building'
p23947
aS' Quite challenging but fun Sturdyness: 7/10: rear section damaged after the table fall, but rather easily fixed Fun: 9/10 Blast from the past'

aS' Name: Electric Passenger Train Set No : 7725 Theme: LEGO / SYSTEM / Trains / 12v / Train Set Year: 1981 Pieces: 485 Minifigs: 1 Price: USD 70'
p23965
aS'00$ (which equals about EUR 50 and GBP 40) Introduction: Our most favorite theme is 12V trains'
p23966
aS' Actually I got my first 77-series back in 1981 (5th of December, I was 2,5 years old) just a week before my brother was born  Some years later I got the 7740'
p23967
aS" After our Dark ages we (my brother, cousin and myself) got all 12V trains at least once  This 7725 was gathering dust in my brothers' room  The train in all its splendor"
p23968
aS" As you can see it doesn't occur at the back of the 12V era train instructions although its larger brother the 7740 does"
p23969
aS" Some investigation learned that all the sets at the back of the instructions date from 1980 so the 7725 wasn't released yet  Here you can see the front of the 7725 with the driver in the cockpit"
p23970
aS' The driver is in fact the only minifig that was included in the set  As you can see, our version of the train has a different front than the one in the instructions'
p23971
aS' Apparently the former owner used 7861 (Lighting Set (12 V)) to upgrade the train with working back- and frontlights'
p23972
aS" I like the original lights but didn't notice that the train had those double lights until I did the review"
p23973
aS" Maybe we will give the train again it's original signs and put custom LEDs in it or so so that the train can drive into two directions with accurately working lights"
p23974
aS" Another thing about the lights that puzzle me are the Backlights  While typing this I realise that the former owner might have added those, so let's have a look at the instructions then"
p23975
aS" As it turns out, the lights are there also in the instructions  I recently learned that only the last car or coach of a train has it's red lights on"
p23976
aS' So unless the train drives with only the front car it will never use those red backlights  Here you can see the cockpit with the engineer'
p23977
aS" The cables don't look very pretty but well, the train at least has working light  Here you can take a look at the inside of the engine car"
p23978
aS" While the 7745 has a nice 'fake engine' there, just the weight bricks and the ugly cables, apart from the engineer and his cockpit, no other nice features here  B t w"
p23979
aS" LEGO always used tiles in such a trains to make it easier for kids to take off the roof and have access to the minifig passengers etc  Here the 'proof' that it is an electric train"
p23980
aS' The pantograph of the front car  It has the same kind of panthographs that the 7745 has  The middle car has 4 chairs  As you can see, some vandal must have nocked over this one'
p23981
aS' Hope they leave the cables alone  This early morning train seems to have one passenger: a workman  I like the small 2x3 windows from this car very much! They give this care a nice look'
p23982
aS' Also the door in the middle adds something special to the train  As far as I know, no other passenger train has the doors in the middle'
p23983
aS' Here you see the side of the train, just after the train has left Brickingham Station where the worker, probably from set 6647 (Highway Repair) that was also released in 1980'
p23984
aS" A closeup of the last car with steering stand to allow the train to travel back and forth without having to 'make head', in other words: putting the engine in front again"
p23985
aS' The train, shunted to an end track so it can be cleaned (I think it is apparent that it definitely needs cleaning very badly)'
p23986
aS' This set can be found on: Peeron Lugnet Brickset Bricklink entries Playability: 5/10 (The train is fine, but with only one minifig not very playable without other sets; also no accessories at all!) Design: 7/10 (Nice train, the inside could have been a lot better, but I really like to original front lights!) Price: 7/10 (the train came with motor so not a bad price, goes now for quite some money at eBay'
p23987
aS") Overall: 6 5/10 (nice set but the 7745 is a better train I'm sure) Well that was it for today  I hope you have enjoyed this review and got tears in your eyes seeing how nice the 12V era was  "
p23988
aS' It never comes back, but maybe LEGO rereleases some of this sets in the 2009+ train era (very likely that this is just wishful thinking)  Edited by JopieK, 12 September 2008 - 04:56 PM '

aS'A very nice review, JopieK! You know, I was wondering how LEGO could justify having two 12V-powered passenger trains at the same time, but after reading the review, and seeing the lack of figures and accessories, I guess I understand why (plus the train is rather compact)'
p23990
aS" Oh, and I can't help but think that the chairs in the middle carriage are somewhat oddly placed, because those placed next to the door are unusable because the door takes up room needed for figs' arms"
p23991
aS" Also, it appears that your set also has the newer couplers, i e  there's no hooks for the decoupling rail to grab hold of"
p23992
aS" With the light assembly it really won't matter, play-wise, or if you don't have any decouplers, but it's still a bit of a bummer "

p24067
aS' The new theme offered great colors including orange, tan, and light blue; which immediately caught my eye'
p24068
aS' The theme focussed on island fun with some adventure, and included some great figs like the Brickster  I had to buy at least one set choosing Truck & Stunts Trike (review coming soon) at the time'
p24069
aS' The theme was short lived and many of the sets were on sale at discount toy stores not too long after their initial release  I picked up this set, 6445 Beach Cruisers for $3'
p24070
aS'33 (USD), which will be my first of three Island Xtreme Stunt reviews'
p24071
aS' Starting with the box, a race between the Street Surfer and Skate Boarder: The back shows some alternate models including a sail boat and jet ski: Same image on the instructions as the box: But the backside shows the Island Xtreme Stunts video game for different platforms: The set includes a small decal sheet for the skateboard: I love the two figs included within this set'
p24072
aS' One is a "hippie-type" with shades and leafed muscle short, and the other "Pizza Boy" skateboarder'
p24073
aS' Check out the "Pizza Boy" on his skateboard: Two green brackets are included for attaching each fig to the long grey bar  Using this piece, one can make the skateboarder do tricks and flips'

aS' The "street surfer" vehicle is pretty nice to: The sail is placed on a black bar and lance, then attached to the vehicle: Here\'s a picture of the vehicle'
p24075
aS' To me, it has that old "soap box derby" look to it - like something kids would create to race down a hill: The vehicle doesn\'t have a steering wheel, but rather two levers which I think work well in the cockpit: Here\'s the underside: The set has three neon orange wheels that attach to technic axle pins to attach to the vehicle: Lastly, the entire set with a few extra pieces: Final Thoughts While Island Xtreme Stunts is not the best City/Town sub-theme, esp'

p24100
aS' It\'s quite sad, though, to actually play the game--the "Xtreme Tower" is the only set that made it into the game itself, and it was a really watered down version of the Information Center from the first two games'

p24106
aS" You can see Hippie Dude in close pursuit: The back of the box depicts some nice alternate jet skis: Same front box picture on the instructions: And on the backside, pictures of the video game: Air Chase includes two nicely detailed figs, Hippie Dude (for lack of his official name), and the Brickster: Here's a picture of the orange hang-glider: And the underside: Unfortunately, the hang-glider is too heavy to be held up by a minigig"
p24107
aS' While I like the brick-built glider for the extra pieces, the plastic wing pieces from the Ninja theme would have worked effectively and be a lot lighter'
p24108
aS" I think the seaplane is the best part of the set: Here's a shot of the front end  I like the skeletal shark/fish design  What's great is none of the pieces use stickers"
p24109
aS' They are all printed: Including the tail end: Although the cockpit has no steering wheel or lever piece, it does have a very nice printed 1x2 tile: The wings of the airplane have hinges to allow them to fold inward slightly: Also notice the nice chrome/silver pieces'
p24110
aS' Here\'s a shot of the underside of the seaplane: And lastly, the complete set: Final Thoughts: Air Chase is another one of those "fun" Island sets'
p24111
aS' Two figs with two vehicles make a perfect combination for creating some dog-fights in the air'
p24112
aS" At the same time, the Brickster's plane can land in the water to explore other adventure play opportunities  This set is also a nice addition to the Island Xtreme Stunts Truck & Stunt Trikes (6739)"
p24113
aS' The seaplane can be hauled by the large semi-truck included within 6739  Hope you enjoy this review '

p24136
aS" The idea of this set is good, and I like the mostly yellow minifig, but the design of both the airplane (weird 'window'-piece, a propellor that is way too small, minimal skies underneath and a strange colourscheme) and the hangglider (two handlebars on the wings, too many colours) makes the set mark the essence of LEGO's downfall during those years"
p24137
aS' I really appreciate the fact that you made a review of this set, Brickster, it made me look into the details of 6735, but I am just as sure today as I was back then: I will never buy this'

aS' Hello all Eurobricks members and Town Lovers, Today, I will be doing up a review on Glade Runner set  This is a very small set which is slightly bigger than the current impulse set'
p24148
aS" It's part of the Race theme which involved in land and sea racers back in the early 1990s  I just love these orignal race themes which is produced back then"
p24149
aS' Name: Glade Runner Theme: LEGO System / Town / Race Year: 1993 Pieces: 29 Minifigs: 1 Price: USD$3'
p24150
aS'25 An image of a 6513, Glade Runner Swamp race shall begins This glade runner is pretty nice looking with its sleek sports look'
p24151
aS' Well, for a glade runner in the water, it certainly looks much impressive  Somehow, I felt that the 6513 is aligned with the 6514 Trail Ranger'
p24152
aS' I always had that perception that both vehicles are brothers and was released under the same year  In fact, Glade Runner was released in 1993 based on Peeron information'
p24153
aS' I always felt that this set is used for Investigators or Police to used for tracking or search purposes in the swamp areas instead of using it for a race'
p24154
aS" I will place this set in the jungle, somewhere like Brickster's jungle settings  Although it looks too bright for such serious agenda, but I think it's pretty useful to use it this way"
p24155
aS' They can rent it from the nearby shop and used it to search  It kind of reminded me of the movie, US Marshals which acted by Tommy Lee Jones and Wesley Snipes  Meet the ace Please pardon his trousers'
p24156
aS' I did not bleach it earlier  (It was caused overtime without adequate caring to the minfig'
p24157
aS' Look at this great article on how to protect your LEGO!) The driver wears a green vest with patch pockets on both sides  This is my favourite design during that period'
p24158
aS' It comes with a yellow lifevest too'
p24159
aS" As for the 1x4 printed tile with 3 stars shining in front of the runner, it's a very nice printed tile that can be used for other racing purposes in other sets as well"
p24160
aS' Overall design The built is very simple and yet so realistic  Making use of the aeroplane tailhead to add as the holder for the rotor is smart'
p24161
aS' The white bricks acting as a platform for both sides to hold the driver to sit onto the centre with the steering wheel at the front  I am very happy with this design'
p24162
aS' Place the glade runner in front of the fan with a reasonable fan speed  You will see the rotor runs like a charm'
p24163
aS' Different angles of the vehicle Close encounter with the "Swamp Sharks" coined by Brickster! See you later To conclude, this is a very nice little set that can provide much fun'
p24164
aS" I don't really used it to race in the waters  Instead, I leave it to my imagination and used it for police investigation purposes such as air crash excerise, search and rescue operations and etc"
p24165
aS' I think it can provides quite a fun loving experience'
p24166
aS' Although, the set might not be very appealing to some people, but I find it very fun to play around and is one of my favourite sets in the 1990s where I placed it with my 6514 Trail Ranger together'
p24167
aS' Summary review Playability: 8 5/10 (I leave it to your imagnination ) Design: 9/10 (Very simple yet realistic design ) Price: 10/10 (A very inexpensive set'
p24168
aS" Great way to buy such small sets at a low price ) Overall: 8 5/10 (Glade Runner is not common in Town and City theme  It's not a must to have it, but if you ever come across it"

aS'99-GBP 12 99-EUR 14 95 Pieces: 206 Minifigs: 1 Review Time! Leading off, the box The front shows the recycle man loading up    The trash can? One thing here is really bizarre'
p24202
aS' On LEGO S@H and everywhere else, it says that this set is called Recycle Truck  Which makes sense as it has a recycle logo on the truck'
p24203
aS' However, on my box, it says the set is called Garbage Truck Has this happened to anyone else? Or is it just me    Here is the back of the box which shows some of the things you can do with this set'
p24204
aS" The Bags With this set you get 3 bags which are numbered  And do you see what I see? Yes, that's right, the DSS is in a bag so it doesn't get bent! Why TLG doesn't do this more often is beyond me  "
p24205
aS' Bag #1 The set comes with a very nice selection of pieces  A large number of these are orange  Manual Silly me, I forgot to take a picture of the front of the manual'
p24206
aS' The picture is the same as on the front of the box  The back shows some of the 2007 city sets in a nice little scene  And inside  Minifig Here is the friendly garbage/recycle man'
p24207
aS' He looks nice but with the same head as so many other city figs before him  Come on TLG! Give us some new heads! The Sticker Sheet The stickers actually are pretty decent as far as stickers go'

aS" When you see it, you immediately know what it is  The back has a droid arm that acts as a handle to dump the trash/recycling in the truck  It's simple, but works well"

aS" Here you can see the dumping mechanism  It works by a sliding technic beam with a stopper On top of the truck you can store the worker's cart  This works really well"
p24212
aS' I think though that the top of the truck overall looks a bit jumbled up with a few too many different colors  The bottom  Trash dumping time! This is a good feature of the set'

aS' I do miss vehicles having doors though  Great review  I was a bit curious as to how the dumping mechanism worked  As well as the sticker count '
p24219
aS" Yeah, the name on this set is strange  I think all the boxes say Garbage Truck  I guess it's up to each builder to decide whether 1x1 round plates are recyclable material or not"
p24220
aS" It's a great model in any case  I love these highly detailed city trucks we've been getting during the last year or two"
p24221
aS' I used to have a preference for the late 80s/early 90s city line but some of these new sets have really surpassed them in detail and functionality '
p24222
aS' nice truck indeed, but the yellow one is better I think, at least if you put them on a roadplate it seems to me that those road plates are too small for that'

aS' Nice review  This is a very nice vehicle, one of my favorite of the newer city ones  JopieK: There are two generations of road plate that are wide enough for six-wide vehicles like this'
p24227
aS' The current plates are dark grey with plain white printing, and look not great in my opinion'
p24228
aS' The previous ones are imo the best road plates of all time - green with dark grey road, white dotted line/zebras, drain covers and yellow verge markings (just like we really have here in Ireland)'
p24229
