I had to give it a 5 as well...... you all know why. Another reason is cause that's how many I have (I think) , including this modified 3 master with working lanterns behind the ships wheel, and a MISASWB (mint in sealed and shrink wrapped box) of the original 6285.

So maybe you could create a a new thred whith some close-up pictures one day - if you'd like to share that kind of thing.
5/5. Such a wubbable boat! Mister Phes, it may be LED lamps, which are small and convieniently fit into a 1x1 cylinder brick. Most likely to be attached to on of those flat batteries. Just what I think it is :capn: .
Even though this ship has no place in my 'modern' dock, I proudly keep it there anyway. :) It's just too beautiful- it deserves a place in my fleet. Though I must admit: I made a deck to go over the cannon pit so I could have some room.

You know the 4 gray hatches that open up on the deck of the BSB? And how there is a bit of empty space under there. Mine has a 9V light and sound box placed under the hatch so that the switch is easy to get at. there is then a 9V cable running up through the cabin to the back of the upper deck with a 9V light assembly stuck on top with 2 yellow round cylinders over the lights. I'd get some more closeup pictures but the ship is in storage out at the farm right now. (there isn't enough room in this house to store it all.)
I give it a 5 as well. It is a great ship. I used to have 3 of this set but recently sold a copy. Keeping 2 of this is enough for me since I decided to gradually downsize my Lego pirate collection. Within a week I sold a 6285 BSB, a 6278 Enchanted Island and a 6262 Kahuka's Throne. Last mentioned sets were sealed copies. Besides, from the big hull ships I also still own 3x 6286 (1 used), 3x 6289 (1 used) en 2x 6290 (2x MISB). |-/

I was lucky enough that I discovered lego pirates in 2003. I went to LEGOLAND billund that vacation, and saw this ship (legend version). I prefered it over the black falcon's castle, and I still do now. I also bought 30 brown rowboats, wich I don't have a use for now... I was surprised how long it took to build this ship... It's a magnificient exemple from the time when LEGO used a whole lot of plates instead of the now chunky blocks of plastic... My version also got the new shooting crossed cannons, I like them more than the shooting ones. I'm going to break it apart, (well, I'm actually already stealing pieces from it...) for MOCs. The special thing is... it has 4 places for cannons, and they are all filled up. This is missing in most of the other ships. Gaetano TT

My Padawans, After that political debate last night, I was in a building and reviewing frenzy so here is that glorious Naboo Fighter (NF) ï¿½ and accessorly that Vulture Droid (VD) review !! Since I never had the first MF Naboo version, I was really happy when I learned that TLC was going to have a new Naboo and I have to say TLC made a real great set !! So here we go !! 1/Instructions & MFs Nothing really to mention regarding the booklet (it also has the moron drawings !!). There is also that DSS !! (Dreaded Sticker Sheet).However the MFs are way more interesting !! * The NF pilot is really a cool fig: great torso (that could be used for WWI pilots IMO) and it has a ï¿½bonusï¿½ cap when the helmet is not on !! Some will be annoyed by the fact that the head used is a normal fleshie smilley but not me since I love that head and since that pilot is a normal troup guy. * Young Anie is a real ï¿½cuteï¿½ fig with a nice torso and especially with great hair piece (I really love that colour that is present on the VD). Also look at them both together hehe * Yeay, another R2 !! (Do you feel the irony in here). No pics (G i wonder why :-P ). 2/The NF I love that ship and that version is really great !! The only thing I did not like (like always when DSS are included) is putting those darn stickers, especially that the yellow is not the same as the bricks :-| Next time use transparent sheet like with the VD !! That sticker is the only valuable one: The shape is really slim and really captures perfectly (or really next to perfect) of the actual NF. Here I have to say thgat pics are better than words so: The engines are nice. The only grip I would have is the the non use (like the UCS crapy model) of the trans blue part on the rear of the engine (Mod On !!). Unlike the JSF, the NF has 2 main playability aspects: * R2 can ï¿½slide offï¿½ (I donï¿½t see the point but oh well...). The rear part where he stands goes down to ï¿½liberateï¿½ the little droid * Yeay another catapult under the ship !! On Kimï¿½s scale ( X-D ), its a perfect set to swoosh in the nudes and a great set to chase cats (or others nuisance in an appartment :-D !!) 3/The Stand Its a really nice small added feature to the set !! I feared that it would fire the gun when displayed but no !! Its nice to notice that the NF is inclined in the front when put on the stand. The thing that I donï¿½t get is the use of the diver sub gun on the ladder (actually who cares). 4/The VD Oh boy I really hate those stickers (Rant On !!). Anyway I have mixed feelings regarding the VD. The colour scheme is really great, way better than the first version. Sorry I have no first version for comparison pics (I have dismantled all of them !!). The use of that dark tan is amazing, its such a beautifull colour !! Design wise I am not a fan due to the use of those droid arms on the wings and on the head !!It makes the whome ship filmsy like hell !! Personnally I would have made that colour scheme with the design of the ep3 VD. Oh well, its not the major aspect of this set anyway hehe. Hereis the VD in his 3 positions: Another great PT set. G, I am becoming such a SW nerd !! I was only a OT fan but those new ep1 sets are a thing of beauty !! Arghhh darn you Lego !! That all for now folks, untill next time... *yoda*
Fantastic review! I might get this set depending on how much money I have left ;-)
This is great! Actually, I really like that the R2 can slide off, it shows that happening in the movies, and up till now it has just been left out! What I don't like, however, is that the stickers are a different color than the bricks...I'm starting to get really fed up with these color problems! Also, what about the shooting mechanism? Does it go off easily when swooshing, or you don't have to be careful?
Starwars4J, on May 3 2007, 04:18 PM, said: Also, what about the shooting mechanism? Does it go off easily when swooshing, or you don't have to be careful? Ah a good question !! For once you can swoosh all you want with it without having a "rubber incident" :-D Unlike the Tie Bomber :-P The only thing to be careful is when you put the NF on its stand: you see that there is a whole is the stand and the trigger mechanism of the canon is suppose to fit in there !! Do it gently and no problemos !! If no, there might be an "incident" hehe !! Swoosh On !! *yoda*
Nice review as always *yoda* Will definatley have some of those. Nice feature with the "escape-thing" for the astromech. Is the "head" "turnable" on the VD? Swooch On! ...aaand there was a new titel as well... Thanks Yoda!
Ras 74, on May 3 2007, 04:46 PM, said: Is the "head" "turnable" on the VD? It is Ras !! It can easilly turn from side to side !! Do you want a pic showing how it turns or operates ? I can easilly post more pics for you tomorrow ;-) Review On !! *yoda*
Ras 74, on May 3 2007, 04:46 PM, said: ...aaand there was a new titel as well... Thanks Yoda! Loool you noticed :-P At least you don't have Kim's title X-D *yoda*
Very nice review, thanks for taking the time to do it. I'm partly cloudy on this set, it just doesn't do anything for me. The DSS makes it even less desirable. The N-1 does seem to be a much better design the the first one so that is a plus. The minifigs look good as well.
A great review yoda as always and some great pics! I too like the loading-unloading thingy for R2 :-D and what great minifigs *wub* . I take it that the MTT was not in stock when you bought these 2 sets?
mutley777, on May 3 2007, 05:27 PM, said: I take it that the MTT was not in stock when you bought these 2 sets? It was !! The only problem is money !! Still waiting for Bday money ;-) It was a choice between the MTT or those 2, and since we saw already loads of pics of the MTT, I thought that the SW community here on EB would prefer to see those 2 ;-) Am I nice or what !! Also looking at trhe price, the MTT will not get out of stock unlike the 2 others I imagine !! *yoda*
That must have been one hard choice to make. 2 good sets or one of the best sets we have seen in years! I don't envy you that decision.
Nice. The droid mechanism is a novel, if unexpected, touch. Is it sturdy in holding the droid, or does it have a tendancy to flop? The dark tan is really nice, and I actually think the droid arms on the VD are quite good. It looks a bit more accurate now.
nice review *yoda* I hadn't the old set so I will definetely buy this set, nice figs, nice starfighter, nice flydroid
Neat set, not a SW fan but it looks like a heathly source of yellow and grey bricks. I'm really hating the stickers, especially the ones used to portray the guns on the nose. Stickers for emblems and such are... tolerable, but I really don't think they should be used to substitute actual 'hardware'.
Once again, great set. A consideration I might buy. Just for the figs and Naboo fighter. The VD is O.K.
Nice review, I'm planning on getting 3 of these
I'm not a SW fan, but this lil'Anakin is so cute! His face and the HP hair piece in dark tan, so nice! But spending so much money in this set just for this piece, no... Nice review. A non SW fan >:-)
Good review! not to sure about the stickers though but i'll get it anyway *vader*
Very good review! The pictures are very sharp and the light is perfect. I won't have any money this year to spend on SW (building a house), but this is certainly a set with a very high playability factor and a must-have for the SW-fans.
Yep, beside those stickers I guess that this version is much better than the old "get shorty" one. Hmm.... shall I buy this? Iï¿½ve already stretched my baby and Iï¿½ve also MODed a loading system for the astromech.... 8-|
Well Thanks again for the review :-) Wow The NS was quite nicer than I expected Love the Coelacanth logo on the side Too bad it is a sticker :-( R2 can slide in and out,cool Ric Olie is very nice and so is Anakin The VD I like much better than the orginal The side wings open up with out having to take them off and move them Now all we need is an EPIII version A must buy Piranha (MTT 8-ï¿½ )
xwingyoda, on May 3 2007, 03:53 PM, said: Doesn't that Anakin hair just scream KKKKHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!! Steve, who's is the superior intellect...
I'm with mixed feelings about these new sets. On the one hand, I absolutely love this set. It captures the originals well. On the other hand, I'm tight on money. Summer 2007 is going to be murder to my funds- there's the MTT, the new exo-force sets, castle sets, and of course more than my fair shair of battle packs. The only plentiful thing I have right now is space. (nice house, practically every room in the place has vaulted ceilings :-| ) But, alas, space and lack of lego money don't mix well. Oh well, enough of my problems. Excellent review, *yoda* You'll have to excuse me, I think I hear my wallet dying... Edited by Mr. Mandalorian, 19 July 2007 - 12:17 AM.
Excellent review and certainly an interesting set. Love the minifigs, hate the stickers. Go figure. At least the comparison shot of the two minifigs together made Anakin look a little less anime than I thought he was going to be. The eyes just look big when he's seen seperately. Whew. Thanks for the review!
We all get upset when we hear certain sets will only appear in the US, not in the rest of the world. That is by no means a recent phenomenon. In fact, itï¿½s always been that way. The X-1 Patrol Craft was one of those beauties that never made the European market, one that, before the age of internet, I didnï¿½t even know existedï¿½ i got this set from Mike at the event, I wonder if he knows how rare and expensive this is... X-D The set appeared in a catalog of 1980 and hung around until 1983, outliving most of the other late 70-early 80ï¿½s sets. The basic shape of the model is really old style: just two wings put together, add a slope with a brilliantly shining space logo, a steering wheel and this shooting thing at the front and voilï¿½: hereï¿½s your very recognisable classic space ship! Oh and donï¿½t forget the tail and these small boosters! The green transparent windshield is unique for a spaceship of this timeframe though. Lego usually used sloped windshields or none at all, and most definitely not trans-green! Isn't this the best camoflaged space ever? X-D The model is quite interesting. The pilot sits between two main engines which go all the way to the front of ship, becoming powerful weaponsï¿½ hmï¿½ ï¿½snowspeeder goes classic spaceï¿½, if youï¿½re asking meï¿½ Those engines give the ship an over all look of a high speed fighter, but may be juuuuust a little too big for such a small ship, as if you put an engine of a Porsche into a small Fiatï¿½ X-D No sophisticated landing gear on this one, Iï¿½m afraid. Lego used to make it very simple: just a couple of round bricks will do. The box is compared to current standards very small and has all the classic elements of a Us box, like ï¿½interlocking piecesï¿½, the name of the craft,ï¿½ but in general, this is a great set.
I wonder why I have seen this set somewhere :-D Very nice review Sne !! Cute little set I have to say !! I love the size of those engines for a small set !! It really quick serious *beeeeep* :-D However I have a question regarding colours: did light bluish grey existed at the time X-D :-P ?? Space On !! *yoda*
lol!! not bluish grey though, but good old fashioned old grey :-$ *wub* some parts are just severely yellowed, making the others look like anoter, brand new color i still have to clean up the set/box
Quote i got this set from Mike at the event, I wonder if he knows how rare and expensive this is... X-D Nooooooooo *vader*! What have I done ...... ;-) Well at least I didnï¿½t give you the MISB one X-D! Glad you enjoyed it - it looks cool. Nice review also *y*! Classic On copmike
Seeing these old space sets bring back lots of good memories. I still have many of these old sets, but the pieces are spread over several boxes. That's a nice gift you got. It even has the original box and instructions. I like those very big engines. It makes this ship look very fast. The space-logo on the minifig is exceptionally well preserved, most (all?) of my old space minifigs are not in such a good shape as this one.
Thatï¿½s really a nice set.... gosh, Iï¿½m feeling old by remembering this color scheme.
bonaparte, on May 3 2007, 10:34 PM, said: The space-logo on the minifig is exceptionally well preserved, most (all?) of my old space minifigs are not in such a good shape as this one. well either Mike replaced some parts including the red helmet, or the seller did, that's for sure, but that's ok, i'll just pick up a helmet some place else. some of the parts are seriously yellowed, but for some reason are very clean. I'm not sure what i'll do, but i may just keep the original parts together. Yellowed parts is not so great, but at the same time, they add a nostalgic touch to the model... :-$ it is btw, very normal that sellers change parts here and there. Very often there's an original brick missing, like a blue one with the space logo or the one with the white arrow. it's pretty difficult to check the goods on ebay that closely... anyway, not that it matters if you get a box in a good condition for a reasonable price, there's always bl
The X-1 Patrol Craft was long gone when the Cosmic Charger showed up in the catalogue of 1986, in my opinion, one of the golden years of classic spaceï¿½ but then all years with space are golden yearsï¿½ This new ship is a perfect example of Spaceï¿½s new style and approach to small space craft. First of all, thereï¿½s the color combination. Seriously, did you ever see space ships that look even better than those white and blue space ships? Blue was in fact, ï¿½color of the year 1986ï¿½ if you check out the catalogues. nope, not the best camouflaged space craft ever... :-P Then there are the new, more sophisticated parts, like that blue-grey levers. Man! We used to love those things! They were soooo cool compared to the old steering wheel! :-$ Then thereï¿½s that blue part in between the levers. Donï¿½t really know how to describe it, but according to BL itï¿½s a ï¿½Control panelï¿½, I never really used it that often and you can see on the photos why: itï¿½s not all that easy to put it close to the pilotï¿½s seat, if you put a pilot in to his seat, his legs are going to hit the upper section of the control panelï¿½ not good! So you have to raise the control panel, including the attached levers, at least one plate higher, making the levers fairly high to reach for the pilot. The result is the pilotï¿½s weird position: this poor guy is going to need some pretty strong arms to keep his arms like that during a long flight! :-X Third, thereï¿½s the seat. This was legoï¿½s solution to allow the pilot to sit down in a seat without having to take off his oxygen tanks. Otherwise all those poor astronauts would simply die, leading to a non-minifig space theme! We liked the seats at first, but we dismissed them pretty soon afterwards because theyï¿½re not really practical. Youï¿½d need a 4x2 zone to place to thing anyway, it makes it more difficult to create small cockpits, especially if you want the old 6x4 canopy to close and we never really found a way to use it somewhere else on the spaceship. In the end, all seats were dumped in the crappy parts bagï¿½ |-/ The fourth new thing was the nose, which turned out to be the most recognisable section of the space sets of the mid 80ï¿½s. The blue part at the front is categorised as a ï¿½wingï¿½ but itï¿½s been used in ï¿½Townï¿½ for other things as well. Maybe that was the best thing about Lego in the 80ï¿½s: Space, Town and Castle more or less used the same parts for their respective models, so it was easy to go from one theme to another. The hull section of this spaceship, came, btw, directly from the ï¿½townï¿½ airplanes, the ï¿½hottestï¿½ thing in ï¿½townï¿½ of 1985. One last thing thatï¿½s pretty nice on this set are the wings and the rockets attached to them. I say ï¿½wingsï¿½, but itï¿½s actually a tail section attached to a classic hinge. I guess these tails were lowered during flight and raised when in landing pattern. Nope, no technic bricks are needed here, just the magical power of a small childï¿½s hands will do the trick! Those rockets, and especially that blue printed tile, were pretty nice as wellï¿½ 8-ï¿½ *wub* and take a look at that white spoiler! That was a great idea! *sweet* The Cosmic Charger was a very good ï¿½theme fillerï¿½: itï¿½s not the mainstay of the space theme in 1986, not the eye-catcher, nor the worst set either. Sure, a coloured astronaut would have been better than yet another white, but oh wellï¿½ :-) It would only last two years thoughï¿½ Soonï¿½ veeeeery soon space would be going in an entirely different directionï¿½ with breathtaking resultï¿½. *wub* *wub* *wub* *wub* *wub*
What a great little set! All these beautiful and useful parts like the hinges, that white spoiler thing and those Bricks 1 x 1 Round with Fins and 1 x 2 x 2/3 with Studs on Sides.... Itï¿½s hard to find more excellent "space bricks" for the same price in a set I guess. *y*
Don't you just love freebies? Especially when it's a super-cool exclusive minifigure! Martian Manhunter is available at Lego Stores and Shop@Home when you spend Â£50/$75 in March. So without further udo, let's get on with the review! Name: Martian Manhunter Set Number: 5002126 Piece Count: 4 Minifigures: 1 Links: Brickset Disclaimer: Martian Manhunter will be known as MM throughout this review as his name is quite a mouthful Packaging The packaging is the standard polybag, could be spruced up a bit, but I don't know how you could. Here's the front, with MM trying to pull off a Superman pose as he flies past Earth. Superman had better watch out, MM's got some moves! The back of the packaging is yawn, just like most polys. I do like the 1:1 picture though, as it adds some colour to the otherwise boring back. Anyway, enough of the packaging let's get to the... Contents! If you were expecting a bag full to the brim with parts, you'd be mistaken. As you can see, there is no printing on the neck, which means this is from, *gasps* somewhere else (mind you, it says 'components made in China' on the packaging, so it wasn't that much of a shock, but still, ) Build Don't worry, I won't do a step-by-step build of the minifig with you, I'm sure you all know how to build one (but if you do not, I'd recommend you see a doctor immediately ) The Finished Set! Here he is, in all his glory! As you can see, MM is a very detailed minifig. He even has printing on his legs (however that has become standard nowadays) and his face looks rather menacing. I also love the cape, it is a lovely blue- as you can see, I'm not very good with the names of Lego Colours, I need Aanchir! - but if you look underneath that cape, you'll find some delicious back printing! Looks great! Ratings (out of 5) Packaging: 3, standard polybag, could be spruced up a bit, but I don't know how you could. Contents: 4, only minifig parts, however all of a good quality. Would've killed for an Oreo piece though Build: 4, it takes 10 secnds at the most. Finished Set: 5, brilliant minifigure, one of my favourites! Overall: 16/20 Conclusion: I am very happy with this minifigure. Whilst some are questioning why we got a Martian Manhunter minfig before a non-exclusive Green Lantern minifig, I am just glad we got one full stop, and relatively easy to get. So go and spend your money on a substanial set at S@H, and I'm sure you will love this extra freebie on top of your order. Heck, get one on Ebay (for a REASONABLE price) if you're not keen on getting a set, as this minifig is not one you'll want to miss. Thanks for reading my first review here! I hope it's helpful to you. Comments are welcome as always! Bonus The JLA minifigures greet the new arrival, whilst Sir Brickalot thinks to himself: I need that Flash minifigure. Edited by Sir Brickalot, 02 March 2014 - 03:46 PM.
What? Geeze... I want this... but I don't know what to do. Moving countries. Leaving Lego collection behind in parents house (at least until I'm more settled). Booo.
Martian Manhunter looks awesome. Hopefully my nearest LEGO store doesn't run out before next weekend. I'll most likely get the steam roller or a couple of Marvel sets. Either way my JL needs to add Manhunter to its ranks.
I really love the cape. I don't think we've seen it in that color since the first Hogwarts set, correct? Ah the memories
Ordered mine today, it'll be here for next week Ahhhhhh!
be sure to keep that minifig away from fire bricks!
Nice review! I have to get it now!
Woah! This guy turned out a lot better than I expected him to be. While I'm not a big DC fan, the printing on Martian Manhunter is beautiful. I'll either have to get him off of eBay or spend fifty bucks this month; most likely the latter. Thanks for the review!
Grr, want him so bad!
Thanks everyone!
Great review! I'm really disappointed that this made from the cheap plastic :(. Mine should be here in a few days. I had to order online since the local LEGO store was sold out of everything I wanted (new SH sets).
I ordered mine yesterday. Eagerly counting down days. It really is a shame we still don't have a mass market Green Lantern minifigure. I wish they'd included him in one of the new Batman sets instead of Robin or Nightwing.
Nice review! Even though I want him, I am torn with this Martian Manhunter figure; he seems a bit of a double-edged sword to me. I love that we get another Justice Leaguer, especially MM, but I don't like that he's in a poly rather than a full on Watchtower set--which frankly is the only set MM would likely show up in. It's good that he gets leg printing; but on the down side he stands out as one of the few superhero figs with leg printing. Again, I will say that I hate the New 52 style (if nothing because of how much DC is shoving it down our throats to begin with). I guess I just wish the theme would be based off of the animated Justice League show; as Batman 1 was heavily based on the Batman Animated Series. --- I must ask though Sir Brickalot, would you perhaps be able to take a picture of MM with blue hips and green legs? I'm interested in seeing how the 52 torso would look with a more JL Animated styled legs (granted lacking boot printing--get on that Lego!)
Yeah, when I first saw the photos of MM, I was puzzled as to why he was wearing long pants.
Just placed my order!

Well, the clever, dishonest kid would talk to the folks, have 'em buy $75 worth of product, then return it. But some folks don't have that much money to tie up for a few weeks while that scheme plays out. And it would be an incredibly douchey thing to do.

I did not know you could return Lego, so I just bought all those useless sets for nothing and opened them... dammit
If you enjoy it, then it was not a waste! Unless you spent your grocery or child support money.
I ordered mine yesterday, so excited to get him in a week or so!! :D
Thanks all! I'll post a pic of that tonight Captain Nemo!
I just got this guy and dig him. I don't notice any quality difference, if anyone was worried about that. I will be switching his hips and legs, however, to match a more "classic" theme. The New 52 can go play in traffic, as far as I'm concerned.
I can't wait to get my hands on this minifigure! Edited by Legoman123, 03 March 2014 - 10:09 PM.
Thanks for the review. He looks great. Although I don't know much about him. Now I just need to decide what sets to buy to get him..
As per your request Cap'n, here is MM with blue hips and green legs! So... yeah. Not too keen on it myself.
Hey everybody, I've been working on this review for some time and have finally put it up: Golden Guardian Review As usual there is a story with Bianca & Gavin from Fabuland Housewives: I got this right when it came out in order to do a review and then 80 people posted reviews of it, so I waited...and waited...and waited...and now I finally got it completed and posted! Enjoy and let me know what you think!
Err,at the stats,it's listed as the 7775 :-P . Nice review and comic...Which Exo-Set are you going to do next?
Excellent review, exquisite and funny pictures, and a great battle royal.... And a mon gorillaï¿½s doing all the hard work.... perfect. *y*
Very nice and professional looking! *y* KUTGW :-)
i really like your reviews and your site hinckley! ;-) a great job once again! great pictures and presentation and as always a fun story to go with it!! cant wait for your next one!! (i hope you do a review on a new city set cant wait to see how they die on that one!!) :-D

Thanks again!
I'm not in the EF theme, but I read your review because I like how you review sets *y* : poor Gavin, humor and the few french words... :-D

I merged your posts Hinckley, and great review! I didn't want to get this at first, and still might not but at least now I'm seriously considering it. Frankly I just want it for the pillar :-P

And thanks for the review, I always look forward to them, you put so much life and thought into each one. You almost want to make me start to collect those figs ;-)
Starwars4J, on May 9 2007, 03:40 AM, said: You almost want to make me start to collect those figs ;-) The Fabuland figs? They're great! I of course got a lot of mine in '79 when they first came out. But the majority came from Bricklink and eBay. My advice is to get the figs in eBay auctions with clear pictures. Some of the 'used' figures I bought on Bricklink came with no faces. Some sellers are reliable with used figs, but only buy from those who use a clear rating system. A good thing to look for is the term "stiff joints" because the arms and legs really loosen up over time. Of course I sell several of the figs MISB in my Bricklink store. How's that for product placement? Just to warn you, they don't all come with the great personality that Bianca and Gavin have...maybe I should see a therapist... back on topic!

My Padawans, Yes, its time for another review (can you feel the excitment?): the glorious Trade Federation MTT, the biggest SW set of that new instalment (120ï¿½). At first, when we all heard that TLC was going to redesign the MTT, I was kind of pissed since that the first version was pure crap !! Fortunatly, TLC made a fantastic set, definitly one of the best looking PT set (and definitly the best ep1/2 set !!). So without further ado...review on. Enjoy !! Before an in depth review of the set, lets have a look at both instruction manuals. The great news is the total absence of DSS yeayyyyy, that is so great !! 1/MFs One of the best ï¿½dealsï¿½ regarding MFs: a whopping 20 droids ï¿½ 16 regular, 2 pilots and 2 security (+ 20 short guns and 2 long guns) and an amazing Droideka !! Nothing really new regarding the battle droids ï¿½ except the new droid arm on every droid !! No need for too many pics on them so Iï¿½ll just show you the pilot and security + a close up of the new arm. Its really nice to notice that the whole body is blue (pilots) and dark red (security). It looks way better than small printings on a tan body. That droideka is really a thing of beauty !! The design is so much better, its incredible, I mean just check the comparison pic. The old one looks so puny. The size is way better, the design is way slicker and it comprises great parts and colours. 2/Overal pics of the beast Compared to the crappy first version, this MTT is way rounder, slicker and bigger (sorry, I cannot post comparison pics before I hated the old MTT and dismantled the set). Now we need a redesigned AAT to go with it hehe (come on TLC, bring it on !!). The beast is on weels (strait and non turning) instead of those upside down smooth round tiles. The cool thing is all those opening doors do reveal details such as the cokpit (see ï¿½3) and all the extras (see %4).
3/Details of the beast I shall start by the top of the MTT which reveals the cokpit and driver seat. Easy access through the sliding top and opening of both sidre doors. As you can see there is not much of a cokpit (like always *cough cough* !!) Donï¿½t rant yet Sne :-P !! Only a seat, two switches and 2 printed tiles. Now lets go on the side greebles !! These are not very detailed but the model is not intended for UCS detailed greebles. As you can notice, both sides are different since there is the mechanism that makes the Droid Carriage come out (see %4). The front guns really look way better and the front is multi directional. The rear door is really neat due to the amount of greebles !! 4/The beast is not alone: the great extras *Hovercraft* The rear door reveals the hovercraft. That thing is really not that great looking but its a nice addition to the set (also it justifies the use of two droid pilots !!). It comprises two parts: the actual vehicle and the top. I need to emphasize the fact that the top part can be changed !! You can put the gun rack or one of the droid floors. Weird that this feature was not even on the box art or instruction manual. Oh well, thats why *yoda* is here X-D :-P lololol. *Droid Carriage* That is really a neat addition that gives the meaning to the term playability (Play On !!). The carriage (or whatever its called hehe) is made by 3 parts: the main structure and the two floors that hold 8 droids each. You turn the side knob to have that Carriage come out (donï¿½t forget to open both front doors dï¿½oh loool :-D ) *Gun Rack* Another neat addition. That rack can hold 16 short guns (for the amount of regular tan battle droids that fit in the droid carriage. You reach that rack by the side big openings. Thats all folks and until the next SW set to review tada !! Like always do not hesitate to ask questions, pics and share your comments !! SW On !! *yoda*
Nice review i would get the set but first of all the price is to big & second im a clone fan but i must admit im tempted >:-)
Nice review! Thanks, *yoda* *y* So a non-StarWars fan is one of the first to comment on this >:-) : Great MTT. It has a lot of features that make a good playability. I especially like the hovercraft and the gun rack. And 20 droids! 8-ï¿½ What is TLG going to equal the dark side? I hope no 20 Gungans-set. ;-) Iï¿½d say 120 ï¿½ is a fair price and a definite "must-buy" for every SW-fan. :'-) But thatï¿½s not me. :-P Another 120ï¿½ saved for the 10190 and other stuff. Trade Federation on!
This is one of the best reviews I have ever seen! Man, this set is good. The beast looks good, but then there are all these droids, weapons, ... TLC is learning what the fans want and they start providing it!
Wheehoow ! X-O This set is amazing...I already knew I was gonna buy it, but now I canï¿½t actually wait till itï¿½s in store :'-) One big vehicle, a smaller one with multiple possibilities and 20 droids... just perfect :'-) *y*
I didn't even know the set was out...Waaaait, how did you get it? they didn't list it in the lego catalog...
Wow thats one fine set you got there mate :-) Its nice to finally get a vehicle that belongs to the Separatists, as much as i love all the republic vehicles it was starting to feel very one sided. This sure looks like a beauty thats for sure *wub* i like the way tlc have made the cockpit very accessable with the roof and side entrance, its much better than the previous version....but thats aint hard X-D Though the cockpit does scream 'Please moc me' :-D Hey *yoda* whats the piece at the bottom of the destroyer droid thats conected to the legs? For the life of me i dont recognise it.
damn it ! I want it now !!!!!! thank you Yoda, once again :D
Hey Yoda... you said you have to remember to open the front door when turning the knob to extend the droid rack... to me it looks like there is a tow ball on the door and a curved top on the rack. I would guess that will guide the door open as the rack pushes against it. I think you need to try that out and see if that was actually what Lego intended!

Only a seat, two switches and 2 printed tiles. *yoda* well actually yoda, compared to other sw sets like the ARC fighter, this set is extremely extravagant with its cockpit interior... X-D but, just to honour my rep, i'll say the cockpit interior is now so detailed that this poor pilot will never ever be able to understand all these switches, buttons and levers... again, what a lousy job, Lego! >:-( X-D happy *yoda*? X-D apart from that, nice set... for sw fans
A very beautiful sets with lots of goodies, great! *y* Itï¿½s a very little shame that the deployment rack only works partially. If I remember correctly these droid shelves should be able to swivel around.... Well, MOD on! *sweet*
When are these new sets out in the UK dude?
Wow... thats an excellent review there. Can't wait for this to be officially release here in Singapore... :)
Great review and thanks for all the photos! Looks like an amazing set with lots of great features. With all the minifigs, it looks to be well worth the money. I can't wait for it to be released here in the US.
man! this is awesome! I can only imagine the old one will look so crap next to this one of the shelf!! *lol*
HOLY CRAP 8-ï¿½ !! That is one hell of a stunning set!! Awesome review as always *yoda* , great pictures of all the features that we all want to see!! Dam i can't wait to get this set *wub* !
i guess this is big for hard core SW fans.. but for me this is a bit boring.. dont take me wrong i love SW but i personaly wouldnt buy a ship that appears so little in the film.. also i only got a few SW sets and they are mostly from classic star wars.. good review as always yoda! cant wait for a new city review from you
*Sigh* I want this now, too (yes, I know that sounds cliche). It definately looks way better than the original, and the droid rack is a nice addition. Does the rack push the door open as it moves, or do the doors have to be opened separately? Anyhow, this looks fantastic. I may get this, but probably not for a while (mainly because of the price).
Wonderful review, I'm so jealous :'-( This is definitely one of the best sets put out by Lego! I love the return of those ball turrets *wub* Could you maybe tell us how the door opening mechanism works? You turn a knob, and gears push the droid carriage through the door, or do the doors open on their own? I think the carriage pushes them open due to the slops on top, but I can't be sure
Yet another nice review *yoda* *y*! Iï¿½m so going to get me one or two of these babies. The brown gunturrets in front are great! The only downside *yoda* is that there should have been Golden Rims instead X-D: Army On copmike

I think the carriage pushes them open due to the slops on top, but I can't be sure I also commented on this. It looks to me like there is a towball on the underside of the door as well as the curved top. My guess would be the towball gets pushed as the mechanism comes out and opens the door and lifts it over the droid rack.
Great Review *yoda* Excellent set there Probably one of the best I have seen in years Love the new droids, Finally they actually have ''REAl'' Blasters to hold ;-) Can't wait to get one or two, maybe three The new droideka looks really nice The comparison photo really shows how much better it is than the old one Quote (you wouldn't happen to have the Hoth set? :-D ) Quote Unfortunatly no >:-( I should be on sale much later (like the SI and RC) !! Hehe, Joking there *yoda* Besides you never know about these things ;-) Piranha
Ok my Padawans, *yoda* strikes again but city style :-P !! Its only normal since City is my second favorite theme ! Enough of that and lets hit the review, shall we ? (dï¿½oh, that was a rethorical question those of you who said yes :-D lololol). Enjoy !! This quite small set is a great addition to the ï¿½harbourï¿½ sub theme (at least its how I view it). First here is a pic of the small instruction booklet and darn DSS !! 1/MF & Extras Its too bad that this set only comprises 1 MF, especially that this MF has nothing new (pretty boring actually). In fact, let me do a parallel with SW (yes, even in city mind you !!): oh yeay yet another Boba !! I donï¿½t have a huge collection of city sets, but I do have this fig in a lot of multiple (oh well...). The intersting extras are the Containers. There are two different ones: a big classic red one (I do say classic because there is thre same in the Port set) that opens, and an open one which can hold the crate with red barrels + the two ï¿½italienï¿½ barrels (due to the coloring hehe). 2/Vehicle This vehicle is quite weird looking with its 4 front wheels !! This makes it look like a mean machine. I guess its to support the mak of 10 tons it can carry !! The telescoping arm is a) extensible and b) capable of moving up and down !! I am not a real fan of green but its good to have another color than the classic yellow *cough cough* Oh look, our Lego employee is looking at me (say ï¿½hiï¿½ to my friends at Eurobricks). Watch out dude, you are moving some inflatable stuff !! loool Oh boy, its fun to notice that Lego City has not implemented the forbidding of night labour :-D OK guys thats all for the review of this small set !! *yoda*
this looks pretty cool, however, i think the price was kinda high for just these elements, a car and a minifig. How much did you pay, yoda?
I agree Sne that this set is a bit overpriced compared to the other line !! I paid 25ï¿½ |-/ As a comparison, the gas station is 35ï¿½ and port is 80ï¿½ !! Oh well, thats the problem of beeing a collector loool :-D *yoda*
25 euro for this? that means it will be 30 in Greece! 8-ï¿½ that is way to much for this small set! it does look nice.. and i am a fan of green.. but i will not get this! i have many more to get this year and this isnt a priority! cant wait for your port review yoda! thanks again for bringing us the latest news! review on! *y*

There really isn't much that can compare when it comes to weird looks, proportions and width. Anyway, I've been designing train cars to hold this type of containers. What does the underside of the containers look like?

25... ouch, ok i'll just buy one when it's on sale at the end of the year, but to think that the already legendary firetruck of a few years back was only 19... then i do have to wonder what exactly is sooooo expensive to produce that it has pushed the price so high.. btw, great review, yoda. even though you do know that the entire world is waiting for your Eiffel tower review, don't ya? :-P
snefroe1, on May 10 2007, 02:21 PM, said: btw, great review, yoda. even though you do know that the entire world is waiting for your Eiffel tower review, don't ya? :-P loooool so much pressure on meessa head right now :-P Until then I am in a frenzy review mode !! I shall go a pick up a new set today to review tonight lololol Review Mode still On !! *yoda*
Very fine. A good addition to the port. And it could be transformed into a giant dune buggy with ease.... X-D
I really want this and the port. Thanks for the review! I think the price may be a little high, but then again it is a very unusual vehicle with an unusual colour. I also like the two containers that it comes with, I was expecting just one.

Now I will read the port review...

*Calls vader* HE doubel posted *points* ;-) Very nice set. Oh and Yoda where do you get these? I would kill to have a shop with new lego sets (The nearest shop with lego has the black sea barracuda as its newest set) near me... Or it Malta for that matter. No one brings SW sets here or the smaller ones. Just the big expencive ones. :-(
Nice! The vehicle is quite good looking. I like it. Though, I don't need this set right now... -ZotS
I see Jurrasic Park Vehicle 8-ï¿½
25 Euro is quite high since it's listed for 17 on S@H... IMHO it's a decent successor to 4549 even if it comes without any cargo vehicle and just 1 MF. But the front being 10-wide is ridiculously wide for a vehicle, even in the new scale. Getting rid of the two red Technic pins should help that, though, I think. 4549's stacker was 8-wide in the front and was already wide for the "classic" scale, too, but 10 is a bit too much. Especially when you consider that Model Team was 10/12-wide :-| I like the lifting mechanism on this one better, though. For 17 Euro I might consider buying it if I can't get my hand on a 4549 ;-) Thanks for the review and the pics *sweet*

Regarding the front wheels being way too wide. I think you've got the 'inside' pair of wheels on backwards, the red spacers are supposed to fit inside the wheel's indented side. I'll also say, that while this is a Very Pretty set. It is Cumbersome to play with, the 'pneumatic cylinder' pieces look good, but have waaay too much friction, which means you have to disrupt swooshplay to pick it up and pull them into position. the front wheels are all on a single axle, which makes rolling it around curves a little difficult; you can easily replace the Long Axle with a pair of 5.5axleWithStoppers, to enable wheels on each side to rotate separatly and have a pin connector on the rear wheels. This should make 'vroom vroom' feel a lot nicer on curves. I also think the connector hook on the cargo boxes is a bit hard to actually hook onto, a 2*2 plate with handlebar would be much easier, assuming 2studs holds on well enough. On the plus side, Green! and 6 of the new wheels.
Hello xwingyoda, Excellent review of the 7992. I couldn't wait for the store to stock them so I ordered three from ToysRUs Canada. Faster shipping than S@H. $26.99 CDN which works out to 18.5200 EUR
if the cargo is too heavy... does that mean the little fellow will be sandwiched? ^^ nice review btw thx ^^ Edited by Hobbes, 28 May 2007 - 04:12 PM.
My padawans, let me present to you that glorious and beautifull Port !! ï¿½I am not worthy, Iï¿½m not worthyï¿½ (oh *yoda* , do shut up and review the glorious set !!). I really think that this set is the best ï¿½07 city sets (I was waiting so long for another port, meessa so happy !!). Really 2 thumbs up to TLC for this !! I hope youï¿½ll enjoy this looong review as much as I love that set. There are 3 instructions manuals and a HUGE DSS (darn you TLC !!): Here is a general view of the whole set: I shall review that set according to the instructions booklets so lets go !! 1/The truck There is nothing really to notice about that MF, another boring classic fig that we have lots off. On the other hand, the truck is really neat. It comprises the main body and a classic container (like the one shown in my review of 7992). Off course the truck can transport all the other containers (see ï¿½2). 2/The ship *the extras* I tend to like those 2 figs: the technician and the lovely captain (who senses a ï¿½Love Boatï¿½ MOC :-D lolol). Than there are the 3 containers: a classic green, a simple one with 4 ï¿½italienï¿½ barrels. The truly great one is the small power boat Container. The small boat is quite simple but looks great !! Tks to the use of one of the best Lego parts ever: the 1x1 slope *the ship* Now the interesting stuff really starts !! Ok, its hard to take decent pics due to the bloody size of that ship (58 cms/22,8 in long !!). On a side note, I did not use the huge ï¿½City Linesï¿½ stickers on the hull (I might add them later, Iï¿½m not really sure). Like you imagined, the ship floats and has underneath the hull the spot to attach an electric motor (not included in the set). Now lets focus on the details of that ship: The front is quite simple ï¿½ it has what a ship needs: an anker, lights and an opening to place whatever fits in hehe (on a side note, its weird to notice that there are NO life vests on that ship ï¿½ not very precautious Lego !!). The mid section is only to hold all those crates !!
The rear is much cooler !! The ï¿½towerï¿½ can be divided in 3 parts: the lower part is where both engines are, then the cokpit is on the second level (see Sne, there is a better cokpit here than in SW sets lolol) and finally the chimney with radar, dopler and what have you !! 3/ The harbour port I shall dismantle parts of the harbour for pics purposes !! Otherwise its going to be quite hard to have nice pics !! Yeay, that thing is huge :-P *the front with fisherman* Nothing too special, guste a nice gesture from TLC adding a normal cityman !! I love the green uniform (I was bored of that blue one !!). As you can see, the front has 2 stuff to attache boats. Ok, I really wonder why a "civilian" is fishing in a restricted area !! Call security asap. *the crane* That was quite a nice thing to build hehe !! Its nice to have a red crane. There are 2 knobs onb that baby: one that operates the hook and the second one that operates the hight of the arm (it makes that arm goes either up or down). I didnï¿½t even care of taking a pic of the MF since its a boring worker !! *the office* That is my favorite part of the harbour !! It represents the heart of the port. First the vehicle needs to go through the opening gates. I think that TLC thinks that people are morons since they added a traffic light in front of the gates !! Drive when its open you moron :-| :-D !! The office is small and cosy and has only the regular computer which operates the door and light !! As you can see, next to it, there are loads of usefull stuff for the employee to work and clean !! I shall finish that review with a hysterical add on by TLC: the watch out sign just above the life bouey lolololol So in case a moron is speeding in a harbour port, the employee can throw him the bouey if he is not on strike :-D Thats all folks for this set !! Until next time, tada... *yoda*
Great review *yoda* ! Thanks for sharing. I was wondering how you got your hands on these sets [this and 7992]? I can't wait to get them. Thanks again!
this looks SO SO SO SO SO much nicer than i thought!! i love the small truck i love the office and the crane! i really like the "tower" of the ship! one of the best they ever made! the only thing i dont like is the size of the ship.. i find it useless since you can only fill it with cargo and more cargo.. what is the point of that? there is the front of the ship...there is the back of the ship...there is the boring huge empty hull in the middle! i find that pointless! the possitive is more than the negative! i realy like the captain figure and the green fisherman! TLC has given us great stuff this year.. this ship remains my lego cargo favorite.. it looks nice in the front..good tower..and a great middle section..not too big not too small..just great! ( i hope i will buy this some day!) a lot of thanks to you yoda! you have given us so many great reviews the past few days!! and this was great!! *y* *y* well done my friend!!
hinckley39, like I posted elswhere on EB, my "Lego" shop received nearly all the new sets (they had the garbage truck and gas station) and were waiting for the other city sets like the train station !! I shall pick this one up soon hehe >+ they had nearlly all the Mars Mission sets and the 3 smaller Castle sets< I might buy a second port later on to expend it hehe !! Actually I hope TLC opened Pandora's box with those harbour sets !! *yoda*
What a nice review of a really lovely set! Iï¿½m so glad that I can now add such a neat harbor to my ongoing city project.... Hmm, I guess I have to raise the city to provide it from becoming overflooded by the sea.... 8-| The ship is so beautiful! Only that chimney should better be placed three studs more to the back, itï¿½s a little too close to the bridge, but maybe itï¿½s supposed to work as an indirect heating device. :-D That warning sign is hilarious! A great and overall very satisfiable set! *y* Merchant Navy on!
Nice. nice, niice review, Mr. Yoda! :-) Gotta love this set.. *wub* phoinix, on May 10 2007, 04:17 PM, said: this looks SO SO SO SO SO much nicer than i thought!! I couldn't agree more! *sweet*
Thank you for this wonderful review, Yoda! This set is an absoulute must for a city fan, the best city set in years, probaly for a decade. I'm a little disapointed with the office, it's much smaller than I expected, but besides that everything looks so cool! Especially the Captain with the white shirt! 8-ï¿½ That is a new torso, right? I do think the trafficlight is realistic, and I'm so happy they included such a funny sign, and it's realistic! http://blogs.warwick...pg?maxWidth=500 :-D And a question, if you please, what's the bottom of the ship like?
Thanks for the review! This set looks pretty nice ... but it continues a trend that's been bugging me for a while. To borrow a phrase from the Simpsons, Lego is "enbiggening" everything. My town is built on the classic scale of 4-stud wide cars, 8-stud wide ships, etc. Now Lego is making 6- and 8-stud wide trucks. The cargo containers are 6-wide instead of the old 4-wide. The new airplanes are 8-stud wide instead of the old 4-stud wide. And then there's this colossal monstrosity of a cargo ship. That beast would overpower my entire city! I know it seems like a weird thing to complain about, that Lego is making everything too BIG. Of course the joy of Lego is that I can always downscale everything to match my existing stuff. I'm also a little bummed that Lego isn't using the classic harbor plates and ramps. Man, I love those pieces. Can you give us a picture of just the new harbor plate? It looks like a new piece to me, or at least it's a piece that I'm not familiar with. In general, I love, love, love the City stuff coming out this year. For many years, City was the red-headed step-child of Lego, and it's nice to see it coming back to prominence where it belongs. -Joebot
great review Yoda! I really like this set with the comical sign, the van, obviously the boat and the captain is really cool aswell! :-D cant wait to get this one! *y*
Joebot, on May 10 2007, 03:52 PM, said: It looks like a new piece to me, or at least it's a piece that I'm not familiar with. . -Joebot The roadplates are simply the same as in the old road construction set with the brigde. But here they just use the straight ones. In the corner where the office is located, it's used the plates from the old street hockey set, though in a different colour scene. http://www.peeron.com/inv/sets/6600-2 ( http://www.peeron.co.../parts/30401px1 ) http://www.peeron.com/inv/sets/3579-1 ( http://www.peeron.com/inv/parts/48288 ) Sorry for mye bad english. :-$
Thanks again, *yoda* for this great review. *y* Wow, I really like this set. Itï¿½s not only for the ship but for all these small details. A fisherman, the hilarious road sign, the engine room, the neat office, the small barrier with the lights (well, one red light would have done) and the great new torsos! *wub* What I donï¿½t like is the design of the crane. Too many bigger parts, some even without any studs!? :-X TLG could have done better with this! The only bad thing about this set is: I already own the 4030 - there is no use for another freight ship. If I wouldnï¿½t have it, Iï¿½d be off to buy it asap, because this one would fit my other ships (4020, 4021, 4022) way better. At this point I disagree to phoinix. The police boat has to be a lot smaller than a freight ship. Here you go! And with one more terrific set I continue to wonder who will have the money to buy all this? :-| Cï¿½mon TLG, spare some great sets for the next years! ;-)
Very very nice. I really want this set, even though at the moment it would have no place in my town. I love the boat, the crane is really cool, and the pier is just awesome. Add the 10 tonne loader onto this set and it's perfect. Cheers for the review. :-)
nice set *yoda* but when do we get to see a review of a mars mission set? *sing* :-P
xwingyoda, on May 10 2007, 02:20 PM, said: hinckley39, like I posted elswhere on EB, my "Lego" shop received nearly all the new sets (they had the garbage truck and gas station) and were waiting for the other city sets like the train station !! I shall pick this one up soon hehe >+ they had nearlly all the Mars Mission sets and the 3 smaller Castle sets< Wait what?!? I thought the toyfair pics on MarsMission and other sets said August release date? Did I read that wrong or did it change or is this a country thing? Nice review btw. I wonder if thats a new windscreen on the bridge (the downsloping windows), they look useful... and now I'm feeling like making a few of those mini speedboats, or that office building, so simple but nice to have around...
This is an amazingly impressive set! Thanks for the review :-) I have to say my favorite feature is...the fact that the truck has "side-view mirrors" :-D It just makes it look sooooo much better! Everything is great though! Great figs, great ship, great dock! I just wish there were a few new heads, but you can't have everything ;-)
Holodoc, on May 10 2007, 05:25 PM, said: The only bad thing about this set is: I already own the 4030 - there is no use for another freight ship. Well, no problem. Since I don't own 4030 I'll happily take yours and you can buy the port. How's that? X-D
Hobbes, on May 10 2007, 06:31 PM, said: Well, no problem. Since I don't own 4030 I'll happily take yours and you can buy the port. How's that? X-D no the bad thing about the ship is that it's a one-piece model
snefroe1, on May 10 2007, 07:49 PM, said: no the bad thing about the ship is that it's a one-piece model Doesn't matter to me anyway, I want 4030 ;-)
Nice review I like that ship but I don't buy it because I have no place. *y* *y* *y* :-)
Thanks Yoda for sharing this set with us too! This set is really nice! I'm like Holodoc, the think I like is not a special parts, but all the small details that you have here and here, like the road sign, a bin, some accesories,... The truck has the same effect on me like the blue one in the RC cargo train. I know that I will be able to buy this set just for it :-D ! But all the set is good, so no matter! Maybe in fact the boat is too long, with just few containers. But maybee we will have additional sets will new containers like the green trcuk. Just hope... Iwill have good dreams this night X-D
Looks good. Though I'm not sure about the boats yet. I would have preferred the old ones. Do you have any pictures of the ship pieces by themselves? I wonder why Lego didn't include life vests (they would have fit perfectly in that little hatch at the bow). Are the green overalls new to this set? Steve
Hobbes, on May 10 2007, 06:31 PM, said: Well, no problem. Since I don't own 4030 I'll happily take yours and you can buy the port. How's that? X-D OK, you buy me the 7994 and you will get my 4030. Howï¿½s that? :-D snefroe1, on May 10 2007, 06:49 PM, said: no the bad thing about the ship is that it's a one-piece model Normally I would agree. I hate big one piece molds like the green ones used for the big truck 7998. In this case itï¿½s even better with only one piece. Otherwise it wouldnï¿½t float, would it? Ship Swooosh On! X-D
Hobbes, on May 10 2007, 06:59 PM, said: Doesn't matter to me anyway, I want 4030 ;-) he man, stand in line, like all the rest ! :-P :-X
Nice review *y* My favourite bit is probable the office & the little speedboat i want to get this set if i have enough $$$$ by the time it comes to Australia *wub*
We were all quite excited when M:tron was released in 1990. Red parts in space was a first *sweet* , but it looked cool, even though most of us were hoping for extra set from Space Police or Blacktron.. The Particle Ioniser was this yearï¿½s middle class space ship. Unfortunately, it didnï¿½t come close Space Policeï¿½s ï¿½Prisoner transportï¿½ of the year before. :-X An over all look shows that itï¿½s not your typical fighter plane. Itï¿½s more like a multifunctional space craft, with a bit of everything, assuring a high playability factor. . The cockpit is more or less standard: only the large trans-neon green canopy is interesting. I guess they opted for a white printed tile to contrast with the over all red-black coloured style of M:tron. I do like the head-on shot, though. It shows that the ship is not so much a ï¿½shipï¿½, but a space helicopter, instead of rotor blades, there are large antennas. I know, itï¿½s a bit too easy, but I guess it was a nice change to what we usually got. Notice that the rotor engine hangs a bit forward, as a real rotor of a helicopter very often does. I like thatï¿½ Looks coolï¿½ Behind the cockpit thereï¿½s an extra room for the robot. Weï¿½re still very, very, very far away from SW droids, so we were quite happy with the technic arms and the levers, still, space urgently needs a subtheme with decent androids, not the alien crap we get today or this nifty fella.. the red wing and the large printed parts function as door to open and close the robotï¿½s private roomï¿½ Then thereï¿½s this boom at the back of the ship that swings the cargo on and off board. Not all that detailedï¿½ it makes you wonder though, when you compare this design with that new green transport container in ï¿½cityï¿½, how a space ship would look today, if it only followed ï¿½cityï¿½ standards of qualityï¿½ The cargo fits in at the back, but not all that good, Iï¿½m afraid. The two black wings on the side prevent it from touching the red tiled ground, making the cargo fairly unstable. Letï¿½s face it, M:tron and this set are not exactly the highfliers of ï¿½Spaceï¿½. Their main contribution to space was the introduction of a new concept for space: transportation of cargo. Add some thieves like ï¿½Blacktronï¿½ and a couple of Police fighters and voilï¿½, youï¿½ve got yourself a storyï¿½ Nevertheless, the ship itself looks better in real than in the catalogues. Itï¿½s not as bulky as in the photos, itï¿½s actually slim built, and the red parts surely made it compatible with ï¿½Townï¿½. But thatï¿½s about itï¿½ Bricklink Brickshelf Lugnet
Nice review. This is my favourite M:tron ship. I always saw this thing as a sort of fire truck, putting out plasma fires with the nozzle on the front. I never had any trouble with the cargo pod, it just needed to be pushed down to get between the fins. Maybe the problem arose with this release, it has a different boom construction than the first. Although, I have both versions and I don't recall any difficulties with it. Also the rotor assembly was changed in this one. It still works, but I always liked the first type better. I need to upload the first version's instructions somewhere. I can only find the second one online. One more thing to put on my "to do" list....
A very interesting set with a good color scheme and some cool and playable features! Neat. The design is elegant and aggressive and that small robot is lovely. *y*

I've always wanted this set (one of the few space sets which recieve that dubious honour ;-) ) I liked the Mtron/blacktron range and wish I had the money to acquire them all. Nice review BTW. Now I want one more than ever... X-D God Bless, Nathan

All aboard !! The train nr 7997 coming from Springfield to Lego city is currently approaching !! Unfortunatly due to the suprise strike of those lousy French workers, the train will not mark any stops !! Next treain in a week !! That set is a Jou Club exclusive (at least here in Paris) and costs 39.99 euro. I think its a must have set for all the city fans out there!! Oh well, lets have that review rolling. Enjoy !! As always, here is a pic of the instruction booklet and tiny/puny DSS. 1/The Mfs and accessories *MFs* Out of the 5 Mfs, 3 are workers (train employee with train logo on torso) and 2 are civilians (a guy in a suit and a cool dude with the classic space logo jacket (I love that torso really !!). The interesting thing is the nice smiley faces - a nice new way of having smileys that change a tiny bit. *Train Cart* That cart is way better than the one in the advent calendar set. The colours are better and its really better designed. Lets look at this carty and comparison pics after: *Smaller extras* One pic to show them all !! I didn't know the bar had 2 bottles and a croissant (yeay !!). 2/Overal views of the station I really like this train station a lot more than the previous one. I really love the classic feel to it: its a nice small town station without the modernity looks of a megalopole !! Can this means that next year we will have a new older looking passenger train ? I seriously would hope so !! The station is actually 2 parts combined: the train platform and the station building. 3/Details of the station (aka the *yoda* twitch :-P ) Lego included really neat extras in that set !! I will start in the order by which *yoda* (me and SW lolol) needs to go in order to catch his train (when those lousy workers are not in strike that is). Our green creature from the swamps need to get his ticket first. There is the only modernity of that set: electronic ticketing (no counters = efficient work and no strikes looool when it actually works that is :-D ). Then he has to go through the controls to reach the platform. Everything is in order *yoda* , please proceed !! *yoda* has two waiting rooms for his wait, one even has a suitcase holder !! *yoda* can check the train routes (that should be included near the ticketing booth but what the heck !!). Paris train leaves at 11.34 hehe So Yoda can take it to visit the Eiffel Tower *yoda* can have the pleasure to go and eat in the small area where there is no employee unfortunatly !! Anyhow he used the force to get a drink lolol With his drink in hand (he already ate the only croissant tsts, there is no such French delights on Dagobah :-P ), he can go to the roof of the station where a table awaits him He can finally open the window and view the empty tracks hehe. No train in sight... His shadow kind of looks creepy... Strikes and lack of employment discipline can ruin even the patience of the oldest jedi !! Our *yoda* decided to steal (not very jedi wise |-/ ) the train cart and is using the force to operate it (lets not forget he is 900 years old, heavy physical exercise is definitly out of the question :-D ) At this pace he will reach Paris in no time (lolol). Next time, do use your escape pod: I think he is too old to remember where he left it after the Kashyyyk retreat lolol I hope you enjoyed this review and until next time, I bid you farwell... *yoda*
Another nice review Yoda *y*! Seems I have to go one more step to the Dark City side of the force and get this baby! It looks really nice! Station On copmike
copmike, on May 14 2007, 03:44 PM, said: If I were *yoda* I would have my drink at the roof with the bench/chair - the sun shines & it's nicer :-D! He did, what did you expect :-P ? After all that looooog retreat on his swamp he neede to have a little sun on the roof to get a tan (or in his case a dark green :-D ). Somehow I deleted the right pic :-D Oh well, I will add that one tomorrow !! *yoda*
Wow! I am definetely going to buy this set any time soon! I never thought there were going to be any windows in the structure, but those large ones from the Basketballsets look great. Lovely ticketbox, the swivel entry fence looks kind of pointless though, but that one can be removed easily. The bar is quite nice with those two see-through closets (fridge?) and cashregister. Just one thing: Why isn't Amsterdam on the departurelist, it was on most of the other stations lists....? :-( :-D
GO Yoda go! *yoda* *y* Thank you for your review and the brilliant idea of including yourself into your short story here! Man, I thought I wanted to skip all these sets, but now... It's like the harbour set: I'm not enthusiastic about the building/ship, but the small details make it very interesting. Maybe I'll have to change my opinion on this set. I don't (yet) have passenger trains, though because I don't like the newer ones 7897 and 4511. :-| Station On!
Holodoc, on May 14 2007, 03:54 PM, said: Man, I thought I wanted to skip all these sets, but now... Wait till the Mars Mission reviews tomorrow :-P And I d agree with you regarding 7897 & 4513: they are way too modern !! I love the classic fel of that one ;-) *yoda*
this is pretty nice *yoda* !! love that ticket machine! and did you guys see that? "Brussels" is on the time table!!!!! Yeah!!!!
Great review Yoda - funny and informative (although a sad commentary on the state of the trains in France, I guess). Lots of useful generic building parts - I figure with 4 of these a resectable train station can be made. Those 1x5x5 trans clear bricks are amazing! I paid a buck each for them on bricklink a year ago. They are totally useful parts in anything you build (I was never able to really clean the print off the basketball ones). Lots of little goodies. I predict lots of bits of this set will end up in many different CC-Market street extensions. Nothing useless in this set. Depending on the price point, this coudl be an incredible set. So far I like it best of all the new 2007 sets that I have not bought yet (CC of course is #1)
This is a very nice station building! I didn't know they made windows that size though... This seems like a return to bricks rather than the last station they put out with all the curved windows and walls and such. I love the little details in this set such as the new parcel sticker, the drinks dispensers at the shop, the refrigerators, etc. As someone else said not entirely sure about the turnstile though, seems a bit pointless. I will have to buy this though. What is LEGO trying to do, bankrupt me?! What with Market Street, the gas station, the port, the garbage and cement trucks, and now this... Now then, can we have that review of the gas station? This is the one I've been waiting on! :-D

Thanks for this great review Yoda this has seriously tempted me to now buy this set because I wasn't actually planning to before hand. I love the cafe and the little piece of bread and there is a good selection of minifigs aswell! thanks! ;-)
Great review Yoda! Do you mind if you aka *yoda* start showing up in my reviews with Gavin and Bianca? BrickZone.net reviews
Thankyou for a great review Yoda and nice clear photographs,this set is a must for me,does anyone know when its out in the UK? cheers
Thanks for the nice review, *yoda* ! I was already planning on getting this baby. But this review has sealed the deal even more! The only thing that irks me is the inclusion of the rc track, no need for that. A female should have been included, what's up with this homo-erotic attitude of lego these days? Wasn't the release date september ?
Thanks another time for thos review! I was on your BS gallery this afternoon at work (pas bien!) and I see this not yet public folder. So I tried to find the good number of one pic to see it (with the direct link), but without success... So I waited some minutes and read this review... This station looks really good, with all those details! I've got the 4513 station but this one looks better and better, with a "je ne sais quoi", a charming touch... And all those details! (I know I've already say it!) The ticket machine is simply great! And the cafe section too, like the chairs and the part to put our luggage! My 4513 will be destroyed >:-) ! simonwillems, on May 14 2007, 03:47 PM, said: I never thought there were going to be any windows in the structure, but those large ones from the Basketballsets look great. I don't think that they are, they look more like trans container parts IMO. And we have new faces yes, but they look rlike we have already seen their. And they are all brown. It's like it's the same head with different expression :-P And for trains in France, I don't understand why is the interest of having the speed record on rails if common trains on the day-life are always late... :-| But I've got some friends who said me that it's worse outside (like in Hungary and Portugal)
Very well done *yoda* . Your review was excellent. I wasn't really sure about this station, but with your review and the photos, I am definitly thinking about buying this one. I really liked the windows and the columns. I thought it was really cool to see TLC make columns in yellow. This is definitly a very neat set. Thank you for the review *yoda* . Model on!
I wasnt sure if i was going to get the station but im convinced now! nice review *y* *wub*
I may actually buy this one after all. Don't know what I'll do with the plastic rails though. I'll probably use them to display locomotives on my shelf, and save the 9v track for actual play value. --Tony
a great set at a good price! thanks yoda you have been making my days lately (well you and eurovision) it looks very nice and i know you hate stickers and so do i but these are very good ones! and new ones! a must have for me since i have never bought a station before but 4554 is still the best one this isnt really a station is more like a platform that you find in a lot of villages here in Greece and it does have a town feeling to it (which for me its great) lots of cool accesories and nice figs but why isnt there a girl?? (again) this is in my list with the fuel station and the garbage truck!! review on *yoda* !

But actually it s the clever building style of that set which impressed me the most. With only two of these I''m easily able to build a good looking customized station while I'm still able to use the second platform for a nice additional station along my tracks. Smart, and the price is also good. :-) EDIT: What I dislike: TLC's Gynephobia. *n*
Great Review, as always It does have a very classic feel to it Love the kitchen/resturant area The fridge and soda fountain are nice touches :'-) More Lego food Finally TLG realizes that lego minis eat more then just pizza :-D After a couple of times they do get old A must buy :-) Are those all the New town sets you have so far? Piranha Quote Wait till the Mars Mission reviews tomorrow :-P Does this mean that they could be not as bad as everyone thinks?
I am curious to know what little town in the middle of Europe (my guess is that it would be in Der Schweiz-Switzerland) has a very small train station which allows a person to convenaitly board a train to any of the listed locations. I mean come on TGV, ICE, EUROSTAR EXPRESS, Whatever AVE runs, you name it. How many TGV trains stop at little stations? I thought it was just major city main stations. X-D Otherwise a great set.

My space fans, you really should blame Sne for me doing the reviews of those Mars Mission sets (oh boy how I hate Sne right now :-D :-P ). Anyhow, that Space sub needed some novelty hehe so I shall shoot that review to Mars and above !! I am very pleased by this set (12â‚¬) â€“ it really looks great and has a neat colour pattern (more on that later). Like always here are pics of the book and DSS (G, this theme has loads of darn stickers â€“ as you can see, I didnâ€™t use 100% of the stickers â€“ I didnâ€™t use the cokpit one). For once I shall comment a bit on the box art. Look at that neat MM Logo, doesnâ€™t it ring a brell to CS fans ? 1/The Mfs I am SO pissed off at TLC for producing those UGLY and CRAP aliens. G what were they thinking. At least the old Life On Mars sets had fun looking aliens that ressembled some comics one, here it just plain ugly. Viewing it from a certain distance and lying on the capsule thingy it looks more or less OK. However,when you zoom in, you just get sick by this ugly jelly. Yuk !! The Mf comprises 2 parts: legs and the rest (torso + non moving arms + head). I will stop on that before beeing too rude... At least the human MF makes up for it: he is really nice and I love that gilden visor. The torso is printed ob both sides with great designs. It great to see that the head is a baklava, nice. 2/ The Trike I love the design of that beast and the colour scheme is just perfect. Its exactly the colour scheme that I am using for the Team Odysseus project and I do have a feeling that there are no coincidences !! Face it, how many space MOCs do you have in White/Orange ?? Not that many for sure. I like the general design with the huge orange wheels. I like also that the rear whell is attach on both sides and not to one like the older trike. Look some comparison pics: the new trike is meaner and bigger, yeay !! Its normal since it has a rear alien prison or vacum as I love to call it. Yeay I know I'm missing the cokpit on that old trike (I just couldn't find it this morning :-| :-P ) The cokpit looks great in orange !! Design wise its on a moving platform which makes it sleeker. Behind there are two guns and a green diamond hehe. As I said, there is the vacum on the rear. I have a problem with that thing: once the alien capsule is in, it moves like hell in there. So kim if you swoosh it, the capsule is history !! I left the sticker on that one because I think its funny. I shall finish with the huge wheels !! You should definitly buy that mean machine !! Aliens beware, you shall be harvested in no time !! Eradication On !! *yoda*
Thanks for this review ! It's always nice to see a space review. As expected the aliens are crap, so I'm not commenting on this. I must say the set seems to follow the rule "Bigger but emptier". This is especially true in comparison of the older trike set. The trans orange theme is kinda cool. Too bad that they are no oxygen tanks on the back of the minifig *n*. I have some questions : - Where did you find this set this early (I think they are due during the August month ?) 8-ï¿½ - Since the wheels are so far apart from the body and only attached by technic axles, is the set not too fragile ? - What is the model of your Digital Camera ? I like your macro pictures. - Will you review the dropship anytime soon ? *wub* *sweet* Thanks for your time *y*
finally some MM reviews!! :-| i'll just ignore those first few lines... :-| :-X X-D not too fond of this set... i'm waiting for that dropship, *yoda* ! where's the review of the dropship?! work faster, you slave! X-D X-D

G whats wrong with belgians today :-D Is it the Eurovision effect ?? X-D I suggest you comment faster on that review :-P *yoda*
Thanks for that review. The set is fairly nice. A new molded Primary Life Support System would be very cool, but the printing on the back is at least good looking and neat.
Great review *yoda* (on a side note, I wish my name were also an emoticon.) As always, very thorough and well photographed. Thanks for stopping before getting too rude about the aliens. There are children who read this. Although, I can imagine what you were going to say because those things are horrible! The heads and arms don't move?!?!?!?!?! What was LEGO thinking? Perhaps these are some sort of deformed drone soldier and the real aliens will be released at a later date, hint hint ;-) ;-)
Heh,the alien is being impaled in a capsule. ^^ I love the golden visor...very useful for possible future Master Chief MOCs of mine!
xwingyoda, on May 15 2007, 03:18 PM, said: he is really nice and I love that gilden visor. And it's scientifically accurate. I may have a look at this, but it's not really my thing. Sure it looks good, but I much prefer some of the other sets from this line. But it's on the maybe list anyway.
Thanks for the pics I suppose the organge 'vaccuume' thing might be useful as ... maybe a 'warp core' in a MOC. I'm annoyed that they re-created the Trike, but did not also have a MonoJet set. This basically forces you to buy Two of the new trike to get an Even number of orange wheels. Yeah, its a conspiracy I say.
Yoda said: Face it, how many space MOCs do you have in White/Orange ?? I have several in both my old gallery, and my new gallery. I don't see why everyone likes these MM sets. I think they are pure crud.
Echo, on May 16 2007, 12:11 AM, said: I don't see why everyone likes these MM sets. I think they are pure crud. [/b] I'll admit that half the reason is pure desparation after so many years without any Space. Praying that it does well enough for them to Try Harder on the next season, till then the parts packs are always welcome.
I will not buy any of those MM sets (Iï¿½m not a space fan, itï¿½s like EF for me, just a look and that all, contrary to SW which I could buy some of them if Iï¿½ll be rich). The colour scheme is good, and the golden visor too. But the best part is the alien fig! *wub* Why everybody seem to dislike them? :'-( I think that they can be really usefull as algaes, with this transgreen colour! :-D

Kahgarak, on May 16 2007, 11:23 AM, said: Algaes with teeth and claws? :-/ X-D No, it was a jok! Those alien are really :-X , they don't look like LEGO (more like a kinder toy) and they don't look terrifying! I mean, if they have been more alarming, I will understand that spacemen want to catch them. But here, it seems that men just have to "gather" them. Those aliens can't run, just jump (because of their connected legs) and nothing more! I think that TLC would have done some better aliens, with a more LEGO feeling and another look. For example, an alienfig with a posture like a twilight monster from the last Zelda TP would have been better IMO... Not a space fan, but I want that TLC makes some good space sets! ;-)
The old version used rubber bands for the wheel suspension. I dont see any here. Whats it doing?
xenologer, on May 18 2007, 06:18 AM, said: The old version used rubber bands for the wheel suspension. I dont see any here. You are correct, there are no rubber bands at all !! It makes the design better IMO ;-) xenologer, on May 18 2007, 06:18 AM, said: Whats it doing? I don't get your question. I will post tomorrow a pic where I will press on the trike to show you that the suspension is not that stiff at all ;-) *yoda*
Well, how can you have a suspension without rubber bands or technic shock abosorbers? Are they just relying on bending the plastic?
Great review again *yoda* . Even though I am a "Town/Train" collector, as a Lego fan I would agree that the alien figure does not seem like Lego. I also like how TLC took the CS logo and incorporated it in this theme. This definitly brings you back to the "old days" of Lego. Again great review.
Thanks for the review... still like the old one better but the MF looks nice! God Bless, Nathan
Yes thanks for review, sad that the mars people no personality has. Ill maybe get dropship..
Great review.........(ya you know) The aliens aren't half bad Early production pics show that they had movable arms but I guess they changed them to one piece They do have a Jello like appearence maybe they are 95% water and 5% Jello :-D my only complaint is they have no way to fight back,sure they have better technology but they end up getting impaled and being examined by humans *alien* Piranha
Before getting in the specifics of your question xenologer, look at this pic: It clearly shows that there is space for those wheels to move. xenologer, on May 18 2007, 09:15 PM, said: Well, how can you have a suspension without rubber bands or technic shock abosorbers? Actually regarding the two front wheels, there is a little rubber piece, that prevents the torsion of the technic part: xenologer, on May 18 2007, 09:15 PM, said: Are they just relying on bending the plastic? That is correct with the rear wheel ;-) You can easilly see from the pic that the technic part is bent a bit, but its not problematic (on the pic I really pushed all the way which doesn't happen whan you swoosh it :-D ) Hope that answered your questions ;-) *yoda*
xwingyoda, on May 21 2007, 10:06 AM, said: Before getting in the specifics of your question xenologer, look at this pic: *yoda* g... i hadn't noticed the gap between the canopy and the parts underneath it before... oh man, this is bad...
Number: 30270 Name: Kraang's Laser Turret (AKA Kraang's Turtle Target Practice Theme: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Year: 2013 Minifigs: One Pieces: 36 ( I count 45) Price: $3.99 Parts: The parts themselves are okay. I personally would prefer the octagonal ring and arms to be in grey instead of flat silver. I feel that they would be more usefull, and I don't care for using both light grey and flat silver in the same metalic contraption. I also don't care for the magenta and pink, but it's probably important to differentiate it from the turtles colors. For all I know this is what Kraang's blasts look like in the new cartoon. Holy moley! Look at all those extra parts! And one of them is a round tile! People: Oops, I forgot to take a picture of Kraang, so here is the Brickset pic of him. Gah! with so much pink and blue, he looks like a friends creation. Ok, the pink color is unavoidable, but the blue...as near as I can tell the exosuit is metalic or grey, but is often lit by a blue light, so this is what we get. In 2014 this design will be grey, but the blue color makes this a pretty useless minifig. Design: Pretty straightforward. I like getting polybags without wheels, because I get more useable parts. The design is playability genius. This is actually a use of flick fire missiles I approve of. MVP: Most valuable Piece It's the 2x2 round brick with grille! I know this isn't exactly a rare part, but lets be clear. This is one of the least expensive ways of getting it. The other parts are great as well, but just the thought of making columns of these in light bley was enough for me. Of course now that I've said that they are going to start appearing on PAB walls. Conclusion: Parts: 9/10 Minifigs: 2/10 Build: 8/10 Playability: 10/10 Price: 9/10 Overall 7.6/10
I like the Kraang exoskeleton/android body. I think the colors work just fine. I'm a big Krang fan though, so I could be biased. And yeah, shooting the little turtle targets is actually super fun. It's the only time I've ever really enjoyed a flick missile.
That is far from being a useless minifig...imo.
I have two of these sets one I am leaving sealed in the bag.
INDEXED *yoda* strikes again with another review (what am I going to do when there will be no more sets to review loool) ï¿½ the city gas station. Like the Train station, I think that this set has a small town feel which I think is great. This set has 2 instruction manuals & 2 DSS (I think its a mistake since we only need 1) 1/Mfs and Vehicles I think that 3 Mfs is quite disappointing in a 35ï¿½ set: 2 civilians (one with the space jacket again hehe) and a classic Octan worker blue jumpsuit. The yellow car is nothing spectacular ï¿½ just a neat little car. The only thing that needs to be pointed out is that there is an extra plate on the rear weels (to have the rear 1 plate higher than the front ï¿½ to give it a little hot rod feel). Its great to have a black bike. I already have 1, so I put the racing stickers on it. 2/Gas Station Its really a neat station with a lot of sweet details !! Its funny to remark that the actual setï¿½s instructions differ from the booklet art (I let you look at the changes hehe). I shall start with general views of that station. Now lets focus on details. *car wash* Thats my favorite detail of this set. The 2 brushes are hold together with an elastic band which help them to ï¿½closeï¿½ on the vehicle. There is a nice light to tell you when the was is over hehe. The two rotors that serve as heaters can move with the handle. I will finish with the roof that comprises the two nice stickers and opening ï¿½windowsï¿½. *shop* Yeay, another shop !! The great feture is on its left, there is a distributing machine (that holds 5 trans dark cones !!). The shop is neat from the exterior with its 4 lights, 2 windows and a door + bottles stands in front of it !! *gas pumps* The system to operate those pumps is quite weird: you need to turn the gas handle on the right, then go and put the nozzle in the car and let have that black gold flowing !! And if you mess up, there is a place for cleaning hehe. The roof is quite nice with the Octan colours and the huge Octan Logo tht turns. There are 4 glasses to let the light throw and 2 lights for the evening craves lool. Finally, there is the sides: flowers, barriers and the price list. Lets keep that gas pumping for our Mfs supped up vehicles hehe !! So until next review, I say Cheers Mates !! *yoda*
Why am I not a town collector??? This set is soooo good. My favorite part is the transparent price list. You must have a huge collection Mr. Yoda. Not only you collect SW, but also all these nice city sets. Are you using them to build a town?
Wow, what a neat set! *y* Excellent pictures, *yoda*! The proportions of that stationï¿½re very nice and thereï¿½re also very satisfyingly details like that softdrink automat and those motoroil bottles. Yeah, my first LEGO gas station! Maybe in twenty years theyï¿½re gone.... :-P
great set, great review *yoda* damn this looks good! 8-ï¿½
Excellent. A must buy. In multiples.
Oooops, you did it again... *sing* snefroe1, on May 18 2007, 06:02 PM, said: great set, great review *yoda* Yep! Nothing to add. My parents-in-law own a gas station in combination with a car wash. Maybe I could convince them of playing with Lego for their first time... :-D *voice to the right*: "Donï¿½t buy it, there are so much sets you want to buy this year." *voice to the left*: "But this looks so great." *right*: "Do you know what your wife is going to tell you?" *left*: "Do you actually care if she does?" *right*: "Aaargh, donï¿½t do it!" *left*: "Get the **** out of my office!" X-D ... Never listen to strange voices in your head! Clean On!
thanks Yoda for this long waitted review! im sooo happy lego gave us this since i dont own a gas station things to love: .the yellow car!!a civilian car in lego city!! .the glass roof .the accesories .the shop .the minifigs cool torsos .the car wash nice brushes .the octan sign on the roof .the colors things that could be better: .the black motorbike...why not makeit a purple one? (cat woman style) .the baseplate..i miss green on the side .the minifigs..a lady could be driving the car things to hate: .the car wash..how im i supposed to fit this in my layout with half a baseplate hanging out? they did this again this year with the fire station... i need this i want this...im gonna get this!! (when it comes to Greece..October maby)
At first I didn't want to buy this set, but seeing this review, this is a MUST have! *wub* It looks sooo much better than I thought, the only thing I miss is a tow truck. :-/ I might add that. ;-) Petrol explosion ON!
ANother nice review, and another nice set! This 2007 city line is very very good! I need all of the sets! Nice station, even if I prefer the fisrt Octan station 6397...
Another great review *yoda* . I would have to say if you keep reviewing these "City" sets I too will go broke :-) . I really liked the details that TLC added to this station. I will definitly have to think about this set. The one thing that puzzled me was the size of the main store. I think it would have been cool if TLC made the store the same length as the car wash. This way there could be merchandise in there too. Oh, maybe something I will add if I buy this. Thank you again for the review, Model On.
Very nice to see Lego going back to the old tradition of make Gas Stations... I remember the old ones, thanks for the review, maybe i get but im not sure.. Is it a must get?
Thanks *yoda* great review! definatly geting this one! *y* *wub*
You should enter the review-marathon *yoda* - youï¿½d kick megablocks X-D! I agree with the rest - it looks goooooood *y*!

Thank you Master *yoda* For all these reviews that make us humble Lego lovers want MORE!(hehe) I really like this set it is good to finally get a gas station again The black biker dude it really nice(has rebel written all over him) And we get a new yellow hotrod gangsta car :-D Perhaps that needs some pimpin X-D Piranha
Thank you for posting this yoda! I've been waiting for this review for a looong time, now I just want it more badly! Today I'm phoning up my local TRU to see if they've got it, and if they don't I'm ordering it right there on S@H along with the new garbage truck.

Nice review Yoda, *y* :-) I like the station, but I also think the first version of the octan station is better ( nicer roof, more shop)
Another great review Yoda I will again probably get this set thanks to you! ;-) I really like the yellow car, very classy and the car wash (it is similar to a petrol station I used to have, which was probably better than this set). I think they could have done a little more with the shop and maybe,instead of a bike, have a break-down truck! nice review all the same! ;-)
Great review! I only wish that it came with a tow truck like the older gas stations did. Oh well. and yes, i think we all wish gas prices were that cheap!

It's a good marketing strategie to make sets with things that are missing, so TLC can do new sets the year after, including those elements, so you will buy them to complete your collection...

That's never really been a classic theme in city. it would be nice to have a few sets next year that link the trains with city, like a warehouse...
My townie fans, here is another little review of a fantastic little set: the amazing (NO, who said Spiderman ? :-D ) garbage truck !! Its yet another must buy set !! Here are the usual booklet and puny DSS pics. 1/ Mfs and extras I can rant abit on the lack of a second MF in that set: garbage trucks need to be operated by at least 2 persons (and in Paris, its 3): 1 driver & 1 garbage man. In that set, the same city employee needs to operate the truck, run and take the red cart on the roof, put the trash can on it, put grbage in the truck and put back the trash can & cart + reoperate the truck to the next stop !! G we really need a Cafï¿½or that poor employee. Apart from that, its a pretty classic MF (the green legs do make a slight changes from the orange). There is also a red cart, one trash can with lid + round 1x1 parts to simulate trash hehe !! 2/Truck That truck is so well designed IMO and have a great colour scheme orange/white (too bad its not green like the one from Paris hehe). It also features a lot of playability. The truck is built in two parts: the truck & the trash container rear. Lets start with general pics. The front is pretty sweet with its two horns and 2 exhaust chimneys. The rear trash area is greatly conceived !! Here is a general pic: You can notice that the red cart attaches on the roof of the Dumpster :-P There is a robot arm that takes the trash can to empty its content in the truck. Actually there is an extra robot arm and with an additional trash can from my collection, you see that 2 cans can be emptied in one single operation !! Now, once the truck is full, it can get rid of its load (in designated areas off course hehe). The rear opens in two ways: first it lifts, then it opens. After that our faithfull employee can start all over again hehe !! Untill my next review, cheers guys !! Trash ON OFF !! *yoda*
Set - *Drool* Just *drool* Yoda - I hate you! You get this stuff so early! Ha at least I got the Fire 4x4 before you! (Got that in january!) Ps - I dont want to sound mean, its just that it takes 3 monts for teh stuff to arrive here and they dont get SW sets here. Damn Malta...
A very nice set. And our garbage trucks are orange. :-P Yep. A second MF should be included (and youï¿½re complaining about going on strike, *yoda*). But beside this itï¿½s really a very appealing set with very fine proportions. Even the trash is nice. The only thing I donï¿½t understand is why is there this big gap behind the drivers seat? Because thereï¿½re no other doors? Oh my, TLC.... 8-| I will strike for car doors on! *y*
nice review *yoda* it seems you can add classic white doors to the side of the cabin. just loose the panel and the 1x1 white brick underneath the slope and voilï¿½: enough room to add doors... would you happen to have those white doors, *yoda* ?
"Play tape saying nice review *yoda*" yet again X-D! LEGO should run all their stuff thru you before itï¿½s released *y*. It looks great - this is my favorite of this years City-line *wub*! And the made guys in New Jersey should love it too ;-)! Wastemanagement On copmike
Next issue of "Yodas review month". X-D Thanks for reviewing. As you already pointed out: This one is a definite MUST BUY. So I ordered mine at Amazonï¿½s two weeks ago together with the cement mixer. If Iï¿½m lucky they will arrive in two more weeks. :-| This color scheme reminds me of my childhood *sigh* Nowadays the garbage trucks are grey. Everything was better in the past. ;-) :-D Thanks Sne, for mentioning that door-trick, Iï¿½ll have to browse through BL to order some more of these good old doors the next days. Doors On!
Yet another stunning review, *yoda* . Lots of nice parts and a great MOC potential. :-) I've noticed something with this years City sets. Usually I buy sets for the parts, I might build them first and them disassemble them to make MOCs, but the 2007 line is different. I think these models will stay original.. *wub* Trash ON! (Man, I'm getting obsessed with those "Something ON!" phrases!) X-D
Thanks again for the review! This garbage truck is really good! And a green one would have been better for me too! But we will not complain with this high level of quality design. Can't wait for seeing those new sets on shelves

Yet another great review *yoda* . This is a definite buy on my list for 2007 *wub* . I think this color scheme looks pretty good too. I have two questions about this set: Do all the garbage trucks in Europe have a hand cart? Are they located on the roof, or was that Lego's idea? Model On.

Thank you Holodoc & UniqueBuilder for the answer. The reason I asked was trash cans in the US look the same as yours. I have not seen a hand cart on our trucks either. Thanks again.
Soo completely ordered. This is a fantastic little set. I can't wait until it comes! Thank you for the review yoda!

Holodoc, on May 18 2007, 10:38 PM, said: I just realized that if you put doors in the cabin, how/to what is the rear view mirror fixed then? 8-| Not only does that brick upfront hold the rearview mirror but also the SNOT frontpiece. Removing the brick that holds it all together will require another brick like this (two of those are used now) to hold the front with the headlights. I came across the same problem when making my european firetruck (the vehicle from the new firestation I based it on had the same problem), and solved it by putting one instead of two of those special bricks inside the cabin, in the middle next to the steering wheel. The design becomes less sturdy, but the car looks great with doors. The garbagetruck (13 euros right now here in Amsterdam!) has the same front. Click to enlarge.
Nice review another must have along with the gas station & train station *y* *wub* *wub* *wub*
I never thought I'd be excited about a garbage truck, amazing... Great review as always *yoda*
Nice truck but when these are on the lego road base plates they just look too big, or the roads, too narrow.
Set #7093 Skeleton Tower Price: 49.99USD Hey all, I can't let *yoda* have all the fun with the 07 lines! :-P Today my 7093 Skeleton Tower came in the mail, it's the smaller of the two Castle sets available in the US at the moment (lucky coincidence CC reviewed the larger one). I was skeptical of this set at first, as most of you probably are, but it's really not that bad. Let's start with the box I apologize for the shine You can see some nifty features of the set (again, sorry about the glare) The box opens in a strange way, the side has two pieces of tape keeping it closed. Cut those, and it opens up nicely, to allow it to be used again later. Nice, I guess. The bags are numbered, which at first glance would be a huge life saver! However there are only two segments, and they're broad. For example the first contains the first half of the castle and the figs, instead of just the figs. You still end up with a lot of pieces, and...it really didn't make much of a difference. They should have just divided it into more segments. And here's the cast! The heroic knight is fantastic, I love the armor and helmet and the classic chrome sword, it's a shame his torso is blank :-/ The beautiful princess, with a fantastic new braided hairpiece And a second face! I'll leave all jokes out of this X-D The wizard is fantastic! Printed hat, hips, and legs Even the torso is printed! I think it's an Imperial Guard torso Here's the scythe, the new sword clips onto a pole. I love the sword except...it's a little soft, and the tip isn't a point, as I had hoped. Here's the mace. One piece mold. I've hated this since day one. It looks too megablokish Now, the meat of the set...the castle! Or rather, the Skeleton Tower *skull* I really disliked this when I first saw it, but it's grown on me. I actually like this now. Sure, it's not very realistic, but it looks menacing. It reminds me of back in the days of Majisto. It's lacking details, but it works I guess. It has some nice pieces, and is worth picking up, but not if you're hard on cash. The "jaw" of the skull opens and closes, allowing entrance into the gaping maw of the tower The "drawbridge" (though it's way too short to be one...eh) opens and closes via the following simple, yet effective mechanism The two side towers snap on via technic pins. The one on stage-right is really bare, and adds nothing to the set, really The stage-left tower adds a lot more, though not all that much. A rotating catapult, and the wonderful bone-cage The catapult works really nicely, and has a wide range The back is also sadly bare...they should've included a treasure chest or some more items or features or SOMETHING... And finally, the dragon! This thing is a monster, and by that I mean big and ugly. It is a mix of the Dino-series dinos, and faux-bionicle beasts. They have some nice parts, but...eh, I hate this thing The major parts are the arms: Legs And the head The head actually has a LOT of articulation around the neck, and the jaw opens as well Here are the extra pieces: Included are some nice pieces that are new...at least new to me (note the new lightening pieces are two-toned: purple and blue) Overall I liked this set. It was nothing special, but it wasn't as horrible as I thought. Pros: -Nice figures -Nice parts -Decent Price Cons: -Few figs -Dragon -New Skellies -Bare interior As the the instructions, they were fine, though they took it a little slow (1 or 2 pieces per step generally...), and I have trouble telling dark bley from black, and red from dark red. Oh, and I hate those new skellies. Hate. Hate. Hate. They look like robotic zombie monkies. And their arms are at a slight angle too! Argh. Price: 8/10 Figs: 7/10 (great, but needed more) Parts: 8/10 Swooshability: 0/10 Playability: 9/10 Overall: 32/40
Thanks for a great review... Funny how Orgel also comes to play when Skeleton armies are around, but the wizzard is great.. Like the other human ones, the skeletons are okay, i have some also, and they are not half bad... Question: is it good or bad for you that the bags comes with numbers?
Well, I normally like the numbered bags, but I think in this case they didn't really use them well.
Ahhhh thanks *sweet* What you gave it 0 Swoosh points he he

Thank you very much for an interesting review. *y* Like youï¿½ve already said a few more details and environmental equipment wouldnï¿½t hurt, but all in all a nice set that works fine as the homebrewery of evil or an astonisher for the one or other delicate princess. Iï¿½m pretty sure itï¿½s a nice work to beef that baby up a bit (I saw you strengthened or even replaced your unfavorabled skeleton crew with almost deadly killer tomatoes....) and maybe weï¿½re able to see some impressive MODs in the near future. The skull-look is indeed not very new but I like it and itï¿½s just a little more creative than another KK dark fortress or so. And, Iï¿½m very sorry to say so, dear Mr. Starwars4J, but I love love love the new skellies and that dragon too.... >:-) But please donï¿½t put me in that uncomfortable cage.... X-D
Very informative review! If I would buy this set, it would be for the minifigs that it contains. Starwars4J, on May 19 2007, 12:59 AM, said: Oh, and I hate those new skellies. Hate. Hate. Hate. They look like robotic zombie monkies. And their arms are at a slight angle too! Argh. I fully agree. I prefered 2 real factions. I won't use these skellies unless I'm building a graveyard.
this was my least favorite set from the new line and i guess it kind of still is not because its so bad but the others are better! its really empty on the back-you have a point there and thee tower on the left really dosent add all that much personally i dislike the new dragons not because they are worse than any older ones but cause they have terrible colors!! (hate it) the princess and the wizard are the main reasons to get this set.. other than that its kind of...been there...done that i just get the feeling i have seen smth like this one too many times
I have no use for this set at all - the ONLY useful parts are the knight and princess figs. They'll fetch a pretty penny on Bricklink until the set goes on sale for half price at S@H EDIT: Oh, and Starwars, thanks for the effort of the review. Great pics and useful info. A review that tells me I don't want to buy something is often more valuable than one that tells me a set is great.
Quote The "drawbridge" (though it's way too short to be one...eh) opens and closes via the following simple, yet effective mechanism Tomatoes? What Does That Have to do with anything? And you build legos in the kitchen? Wierd. *wacko*

Oh, you have a nice kitchen. :-) what did you did you cook them with? Yes.
Quote It seems the wizard had some sort of accident. :-P Anyway, thanks for the review. I will almost certainly not buy this. I suppose it's a decent set, but it just appeal to me like the others do. Like mentioned before, the main reason for to get this would be for the Wizard and Princess...
Great review Jay. I love it! Looks like a fantastic set. Great minifigs, esp. the wizard and the princess. I love the scythe! That will come in handy as we get closer to Halloween. I plan to buy this, esp. after your review. Thanks for taking the time to share the images.
Hmm what am I doing in a castle topic?? :-D Anyway good review The only disappointment was the wizards staff I hoped the lightning would be all trans light blue :'-( Piranha (Why?Because it would make great force lightning X-D )
You did a great job on the review SW4J. I give you two *y* up. I would have to say that I am only interested in the figures too. I really like the skeleton figures. They remind me of the Warhammer figure sets. I thought the price was just a bit much. Definitly priced at a little more than 10 cents a brick. This could be one of the sets I would look into when it goes on clearance. Thanks again for the review, Model On.
Yeah, I agree that the figs are the best part of the set, and as I mentioned I'm really disappointed in the interior |-/ I still think it's a fun little set though, but it had a lot more potential that it didn't use, it's definitely NOT the star of the theme Piranha, on May 19 2007, 12:19 AM, said: The only disappointment was the wizards staff I hoped the lightning would be all trans light blue :'-( Piranha (Why?Because it would make great force lightning X-D ) Actually, the amount of purple seems to vary from piece to piece, I'd assume blue was the primary color used in injection, and if you're lucky you might get one that had a low amount of purple. I took a comparison of the three my set came with for you to see what I'm talking about As you can see, the first would be fine for force lightening :-) Edit: Bonus Picture
hehe thats a great Pic there of luke getting blasted with lightning I would prefer that piece then the one I am Currently using X-D I kinda liked the seaweed as force lightning So I will buy the "New" force lightning on BL and hope it has very little light purple :-D Piranha
starwars4j could you take a picture with the gate closed? i really wonder how that looks... thanks!
Thanks for the nice review ! Damn i come much too late for any kind of tomato-joke now... X-O Apart from that very childish looking (yeah, i know) dragon - i like the vikings line dragons much more - this set is appealing in many ways: minifigs (especially if you're lucky enough to LOVE those skellies, new parts, nice overall design... i'll get one for sure. :-)
Starwars4J, on May 19 2007, 05:46 AM, said: Ha, awesome, just like I'm going to do for my magicians (I hope that in the future Lego makes this piece in other colours). Thanks for the review. I guess this is my least favourite set of the line. Sure, it's pretty good, but it misses something (first off, an interior). The minifigs are awesome, two more skellies (which I LOVE) are always welcome, and then there is the Wizard (who will become a lich- an undead wizard), the beautiful princess (guess I'll turn her into a sorceress) and a nice knight. The dragon is weird, I prefer the black version from the King's castle set, still it certainly isn't the reason I'm getting this set. Oh, there's a black Viking horn in the spare parts! Please, could you tell me how many there are of them in the set and how they are used? Shakar
Thanks for the review! (even of a poor set...) This seems to be the main redeeming feature (besides the obvious figs): Starwars4J, on May 18 2007, 09:59 PM, said: It'll be perfect for My sheath design... Thanks again and God Bless, Nathan
Hmm, I like the Wizard, the bone cage is really great and the lightning-things are good. As for the princess, I think I'm in love! ;-) Other than that, it's not bad, just not great.
Starwars4J, on May 18 2007, 10:59 PM, said: Hey all, I can't let *yoda* have all the fun with the 07 lines! :-P How dare you !! :-D :-P Very nice review SW4J 8-ï¿½ I really love those Mfs, especially the nice lady and amazing dark wizard (I ust imagine Brickster drooling in front of the pic X-D ). There are some features like the bone prison that really looks great and those blue thunderbolts are stunning *wub* They can have loads of uses: water geasers, engine steam and what have you ;-) You really anticipated my request with the following pic ;-) Starwars4J, on May 19 2007, 05:46 AM, said: Bonus Picture Die Jedi Scum X-D *yoda*
Never too late for a tomato joke :-P Maybe Ogel is allergic (don't know it's the right word) for tomatoes, easy way to defeat him. Nice review, thank you :-) Could you make a picture of the head of the knight without helmet please?
Yeh i went to legoland and was so dissapointed by the lack of new lego there i went on a lil trip to bluewater and hay presto they had aero booster, golden city tower and the majority of the new mars mission and the two small castle!!! i got the tower and aero booster will do a review when ive loaded my pics!!
Right to start with the box pictures first one 8106 Aero Booster apologies for the large pics i am tryin to resize them right golden tower hopefully smaller pics lol right i think its worked this time lol
right first of all the blue mech does anyone no the name of this mech lol its a good lil mech very nice colour the same as ryo's cyclone defender except for the back ... this is how it attachs to the booster the gun from the left hand of the booster can be attached using the yellow piece off the right hand side of the blue mech the booster i love this its huge the blue bits of the booster are my favourite parts apologies for the last pic it went all blurry when i changed the size overall im gonna give the set a 8 out of 10 good design and i love that hes goin so quick on the box the rest of the pic is blurred one slight problem is that i cant see how the golden guardian would be able to attach to it hope this has been an ok reveiw i will do the golden tower review when ive built it *sweet*
Great review!The Sonic Raven is absolutely lovely.
Thanks for the review, especially the box shot that shows the female Exo-Force figure. In regard to Aero Booster, that red piece at the end of the gun wouldn't happen to be a technic driving ring would it? http://www.bricklink...=7893030&rID=-2 ...or... http://www.peeron.com/inv/parts/6539 I hope so; it could mean a geared car is coming! (Or it could just be leftover from the crane, but I have high hopes!) (Bad first post I know.)
New female fig? Awesome! From earlier box shots I figured it was just another one of the black-haired EF male fig. The new female torso looks like it could be really good for a female-dominant purple-themed Castle faction... Would it be possible to get some up-close shots of her, por favor? m19
Theseï¿½re indeed two very interesting sets, thanks for that review. *y* A little flying fighting machine for Hitomi on top of that tower is a good idea, TLC shouldï¿½ve included a feature like that in their original design....
Heh, I went to Legoland today, no new Lego at all, in fact...a pretty awful selection lol, So when I got home I spent ï¿½160 on all the new sets that came out (Bar City) Hopefully these new sets will be at MK, as Ill probably go in a few weeks. Nice to see you got these man.
No offense, but the pics are blurry and I can't see much. Mine are coming soon(all 3 of them) and I will do a review with pics. Thanks for the box art though, I could see that good.
Nice Review! I love that Aero Booster. Its fricking sweet! The jet pack is cool. -ZotS
Oh I love this set! Unfortunately, I don't have a job (I'm 15) so I only have limited money, which I am saving for the Castle line. But I do love the Aero Booster! Thanks for the box pics, I like seeing what's on the back of the boxes. Couldn't really see the Booster part. Oh, and the mech is called Aero Booster, even withour the jet-pack. (That's just an assumption though.)
no you said no offense and all but sorry i am offended sorry i dont have a great camera and the editin software on this computer isnt the best i got the pics to you all as quickly as possible the reason i had to make them smaller was you guys had a go at me last time for putting to larger pics on the forum i was gonna post pics on here with a reveiw of the tower but dill is obviously better than me so ill let you wait thank you to everyone else that appreciated the time i took if any of you do wanna see the pics there in my brickshelf account under the name dash :-(
No, really, I didn't mean to offend you. I was just pointing that out. I noticed that you said the pics were blurry cause of resizing, sorry, I didn't see that. Resizing can mess up pics easily. Sorry, I wouldn't have said anything if I saw the resizing bit, again I am sorry. :-) The review was great, BTW. Don't give up, resizing messes it up but you'll find some way around it. :-)
ok thank you sorry to through mind the pun but my toys out of the pram lol *sweet* ill do the reveiw as soon as my pc starts playin nice lol which unfortunately could be tomorrow as its my girlfriends birthday today sorry guys ill put pics of hitomi up for the time being
Hitomi looks nice. I hope her face is feminine enough. I already have an idea on how to use her. Shakar

I am curious to see what the training room looks like.
Ooh yes, looking forward to the Golden Tower review. I too would like to see interior pics please, thanks. *sweet* *y*
sorry about the wait but ive had cam trouble these pics have been taken with my new fone so hope there ok first hitomi normal face cute lol battle face a girl not to mess with the tower top of the tower my stickers came partially blurred so i think i may complain and i feel more effort could have been put into the top the security vault this is a small safe where u can put all the codes that u have collected and is reveiled by a gate that lowers with rockets on it for protection but if the sonic raven hits it with a missile it ejects the safe out of the back and into the robots grasp muhahah lol the training room is a lil dissapointing the sticks are obviously for hitomi to train her sword techniques as next to them were the swords which she had in her hands previous also below the panel is two connectin pieces for an expansion maybe? the flags the sonic raven i love this control panel as it shows the missiles on either side ready to be pressed the turbines are cool and due to the cog sytem u dont have to twist fast to get them to really rotate the shooter mechanism could be better as it is difficult to use with one hand and u can only shoot one after the other [/img]http://www.brickshel...07/sp_a0032.jpg[/img] ahhhh the tower is under attack overall i will give the set a 6 out of 10 as i was shocked by the price *n* in comparison to what u get but i do like the set and it has good playability and hitomi who rocks *sweet* let me now if u want ne more pics and what you think and sorry about the wait and the pics thanks hayatoson
Looks cool, and from seeing the pics, Id agree about the price. More Mars sets are up on S&H now too, for anyone who cares.
Gah, the female fig needs to come with cat ears. X-D
A very useful review. The Tower is nice with interesting parts, but that Raven looks a little desperate.... Well, Hitomi is really a nice MF! Funky females of the future on! X-D
Thanks for the pic of the second floor of the Golden Tower. My sets will arrive in a coupe days or so(I hope) And I will do a comic review on all three of them.
Ah, Hitomi is nice. I was hoping for light blue eyes and she's got yellowish green ones, but she's still nice. :-$ The gold katanas are awesome also. The tower looks cool, it's a shame that it's so small. Shakar
Nice Reviews. I'm really liking both these sets, especially that Aero booster. *wub* And that golden tower comes across looking better than I thought it would. Seems worth it just for Hitomi and some gold katanas though. X-D
Woah!! X-O That's on my buy list, that's for sure! ;-)
Since this has no mecha in it, I'm putting the review in this forum. Anyway let's get at it. Fight for the Golden Tower Set Number 8107 571 Pieces Price: 49.99USD I found this little beauty when I paid a visit to my local TRU...who had all the sets in! Let's start with the box Front: Back: The bags are numbered, and it worked nicely for this build Here's the "DSS", however it's not quite so "D"...I'm sorry *yoda*, but this thing is BEAUTIFUL :'-) They're like chrome or something...I never apply stickers on EF sets, but still...nice to have around? Now let's take a look at the girl... Torso: Angry face: Her hair seems to be made...differently. It's still some sort of rubber, but it's a much, much harder rubber. It still doesn't stay on her head any better unfortunately... And of course, I can't forget the centerpiece of the whole set...the four GOLDEN KATANAS These little things are awesome And now the fighter...thing Oh wait! It's not a fighter. IT'S A GUN. What a lousy design...not only does it LOOK bad, but it's in the shape of a GUN. Not only very unaerodynamic, but what happened to your non-violence policy, Lego? A gun that actually shoots? Hypocrites :-| You can actually make the turbines rotate for a decent amount of time thanks to the torque given by the large gears And of course, when you pull on the "trigger" the gun will fire. If you press on the right side the right gun will fire, and vice versa. This thing is getting dismantled SOON, so if you want any more pictures to be taken, ask soon And now the TOWER This thing I *wub* This is such an awesome little building which I thought I'd be taking apart right after the review...I'm actually leaving this up! Let me show you why The front of the first floor Here is the stand for two of the katanas. Normally there'd be stickers on the front round tile and on the glass panes. The front can rotate down via the geared mechanism to reveal a pair of missiles...however there's no real launcher mechanism, so this is kind of disappointing and it felt thrown-in Inside of the first floor Also, you see a black disk. If it is hit with a projectile (presumed to be one from the flying GUN) it will cause the whole section of the floor to lift up, throwing a small safe with the code in it. This clearly has to be the master code ;-) The floor is held by a pair of friction pins and held in place by a single jumper plate The inside of the second floor Very plain...just a single computer (when the decal is applied...seriously, why couldn't they just use one of the many printed computer tiles? Lazy... The second floor (front - blow up) The second floor actually really impressed me...but clearly not on the outside. The front of the second floor is an 8x8 grill plate, held in place with some SNOT techniques...and it's surprisingly sturdy! Finally they're catching on to what space builders have been doing for 5 years :-D The roof The roof has a single projectile cannon that is capable of firing back at the FLYING GUN. Clearly in this situation the humans are at a disadvantage...on WAIT, no they're not, because the robots need a human arm to fly the thing |-/ For some reason...the floor of the roof can be removed...or at least a large part of it Not really sure if there's any rhyme or reason to this. There's a small 1x2 white railing brick that can be used to lift it, so my first guess would be as a means to get to the roof, however the second floor doesn't have this, besides the lack of a ladder or stairs to actually get THROUGH the opening. The whole temple is separated into three floors, the second floor can be lifted off the first, as it's just sitting on some plates Also, those odd decorations are held on via this mechanism Overall: Price: 7/10 (I'd expect this to be about 10USD cheaper...) Parts: 7/10 (way too many pieces wasted on that stupid flying GUN :-X ) Figs: 4/10 (that price and only one fig? And a single devastator? Pathetic...this wouldn't even be acceptable in a license set, this is supposed to be cheaper!) Playability: 8/10 (the tower that is...and I'm sure young kids will love swooshing the flying GUN around...though those missiles can easily go off accidentally) Overall: 26/40 Overall I actually liked this set, it's only the second Exo-Force set that I'm going to keep together and actually liked (the first being the Supernova, which I found to have a decent construction...and loved the wrist mechanism). I love, love that temple, and the only thing I think I'd mod would be to remove the large projectile cannon and remove the "target" and safe, possibly moving the computer terminal downstairs and moving the storage of the golden katanas to the second floor. It's a great little set that was mainly ruined by the flying GUN. I'd definitely recommend it, even to a non-exo-force fan
Great review...........Wait this time its not *yoda* I really like the gold katanas,they would go great with my Mandalore the Ultimate fig I'm making :'-) Not really a fan of Exo-force but those swords are tempting me X-D Thankz Piranha
Yay! Thanks for the review Starwars4J. I think they're sticking to the handle design for air-crafts, as they had that for the Sonic Phantom too.
Thanks for that very good review! Yeah, that ugly flyer is |-/ , but the tower is really nice with useful parts. A neat alternation to the overflooding vehicle sets.... *y*
Thanks for the review! I had wanted this for parts but $50 seems a little steep... I was expecting $40... a liltte optimistic X-D God Bless, Nathan

Especially the gold katanas.
Thank you for the review. The GUN looks ugly, I'd much prefer it to be replaced with one more or two floors added to that awesome tower. Hitomi is *wub* , I want her and some of those gold katanas. I may get this set, but with Bionicle and Castle there's so much stuff I'll have to buy this summer... Shakar
Nice review. This looks like a good set. As for the no gun policy thingy - that went away several years ago. The shooting fighter is a smaller version of the sonic phantom. - And that's how it's supposed to be. Actually I think it heightens the playability of the set several points. MORE GUNS LESSER DISC LAUNCHERS EXO FORCE ROCKS AND MARS MISSION SUX X-D KimT
I'm not an exo-force fan but this set is awesome.When I say that I mean the tower itself. X-D This would've gone great with the ninja theme. |-/
Nice review, I don't like the exo-force very much but I like the figs and Robots. Maybe they gonna make battlepacks.

I love the Sonic Raven,although i might recreate it with my own pieces to remove the shooting mechanism,and make it more greebly.
I've been informed that the Golden Tower will end up more limited than the Aero Booster or Mobile Devastator: the price point will not continue into the next wave of sets. If you're on the fence, I'd not pass it up the first time it goes on sale.

Finally got my hand on the 7990 cement mixer (which apparently slipped through *yoda* 's reviewing frenzy) so here's my review for all EB City fans. :-) My "good" camera was out of batteries so I used another not as good one. Some pictures may not be that good quality, sorry for that. Here we start with the content of the box. There are two parts bags + the big blue cement tank parts, a rubber-like hose and two 1x16 bricks: Here are the instructions book and sticker sheet (sorry, I normally don't apply them so you won't see them on the truck in this review - the cement mixer looks nice enough even without them ;-)): Let's take a closer look at the cement tank parts. Look, they have the spiral blades real cement mixers have - so we're looking at a "working" cement mixer :-): The assembled part looks like a lot of MOCing possibilities *sweet* : Nothing special when it comes to the minifig in this set. It's a regular worker with an evil grin (i'd say), hence the subtitle for this review :-) : The only accessory is this shovel. After a few minutes, here's a very promising truck base. Only one detail i don't like much (as in the garbage truck or fire engines): the small wheels. They don't really suit such large / heavy duty vehicles. It's actually pretty weird that city cars and trucks use the same wheel size. *wacko* Now only the mixer tank and hose are missing and our truck looks good: For those of you who wonder (and would have asked for it anyway ;-) ), here's a detail shot on the rotation mechanism for the tank: The mixer tank parts are assembled as follow: Final touch to this very nice design: the rubber hose! The tank and hose are now attached and here's the cement mixer in all it's glorious beauty *wub* Extra parts: And of course, the cement ! A funny note: the instructions book lists a hybrid part here. Pay attention. ;-) :-D maybe the person in charge for the parts listing had a bad night just before :-D OK, let's start working and fill those holes: Hey, watch it ! Careful with that hose ! X-O Hmmm i guess it's time for a good cleaning, now :-| Hope you enjoyed the ride !
that's a great review of a pretty good set. *sweet* i'll take at least two. i'm also happy that the blue cylinder comes in two pieces and are being put together with technic pins. can't be difficult to use those some place else... *sweet*
Another great review (ha, *yoda* !!). I'll definately get this one along with the garbage truck. *sweet*
Nice review Cabby! It looks like his "cement-hat" had time to hardened - must be a killer to clean :-P! I really like your picture of the truck base. Not that the pieces/stuff are anything special but the picture got me thinking into making a lot of bases and putting different gear on them. Mix On copmike
Very nice review. Lots of pics, lots of description. *y* As for the set, it does seem interesting. I can see the mixer parts serving as engines in a space MOC, but I'm not sure I'd want to take apart the set. Sounds like I'll have to buy a few if I can. Good job, LEGO, you're managing to interest me in areas I never bothered with much before. Can we look forward to another excellent review in the future?

Why not ? :-) Yoda can't possibly keep up the pace of reviews frequency he had lately anyway ;-) :-P
Thanks for the review! After seeing some pics on the net you proved what I thought: for me the base and the cylinders are a bit too long. It kinda looks "awkward". I prefer a "bulkier" truck like this one (about the same size, but bigger wheels and a "thicker" cement tank). Nonetheless, as with all the new City sets: finally something new *y*
Nice rewiev.great set.
Thatï¿½s indeed a very fine and funny review, with good and useful pictures, thanks, Cabby! *y* A very nice set with an appealing color scheme and that tank could be helpful in some MOCs.... GoodFellas on! X-D

The 7990 is actually a bit off-scale if you think about it. Real cement mixers are huge ! That one would be a mini cement mixer. :-)
Thanks Cabby for this review which I was wainting for! Nice pics! Hobbes, on May 27 2007, 03:00 PM, said: I prefer a "bulkier" truck like this one (about the same size, but bigger wheels and a "thicker" cement tank). Me too, but the 7990 is already a good one for an official LEGO set. So I will buy it (without esitation, like all the new city sets :-D (when I will find them on shelves, hard to wait...) The colour scheme is really nice. It will be nice to have the same set in different colours, like in yellow or in green, to make other cement companies.

Ah yeah, true. I was all excited about the idea because all the blue pieces can easily be replaced by another color. No, wait. Not the mixer tank. :-$ So we definately need different sets. :-D
Nice review, *y* I will pick up one of these
Thanks Cabby for your nice review. *y* And congrats that you managed to outrun *yoda* ! ;-) Two days ago a lingerd thorugh a local real,- market. They already had the 7990! 8-ï¿½ But I already ordered my copy at amazon's. *sing* Patience On! (ough, we heard that a lot lately)

(ough, we heard that a lot lately) several sets arrived in belgium on friday, but not the cement mixer :-X which was the one i was waiting for the most... still i'll mod this one when i find it. i'll make it a bit shorter, get rid of the second pair of wheels, because in belgium, we usually have 6 wheeled mixers, not the 8 wheeled trucks. the smaller truck will also make the cylinder look larger, which is IMO a good thing. right now, it looks just a little bit too small... i'll also move the black tap and the mirror to the ceiling. usually trucks like these have large mirrors at the ceiling, not so much the classic mirror you find on any car, that way i can also add doors...

And the halfpipe (can't find any better english description, LOL) where the cement goes out, like here:

Thank you for this wonderful review, Cabby. *y* It's nice to see someone besides Yoda is pulling the weight 'round these parts. It's a relief the tank is made of two parts connected via technic pin, I foresee that will be very useful in various space MOCs, both whole and spit....I know, not best clairvoyance. :-P UniqueBuilder, on May 27 2007, 04:50 PM, said: And the halfpipe (can't find any better english description, LOL) where the cement goes out, like here: :-D

I was thinking of using your plate how you described it and attach this piece as mirror. The 1x1 clip piece used in the model just doesn't look right...
Good Review! *y* still not sure about this set if i have enough money left from the other city sets

(Apologies for the rushed photos - I'm not really into doing reviews but I thought I would put these photos up since these kits haven't been reviewed on here yet) The Phantom (75048) Sticker sheet: Minifigs: Ezra Bridger and Chopper. Ezra has two expressions and a helmet At the end of bag 1: At the end of bag 2: Spare parts: The top is removable for access to the astromech and there's a small compartment at the back where Ezra's blaster and helmet (or hair) can be stored The finished product: It's a straightforward build with no real surprises. The cockpit is almost airtight, the folding wings are nicely executed. The Ghost (75053) Sticker Sheet: Minifigs: Kanan Jarrus, Hera Syndulla, Zeb Orrelios, random stormtrooper Kanan and Hera have two expressions. Is this a new piece? After bag 1: The front gunnery section slides out for minifig access (and there's room to seat two in there). I've pulled the cargo bay out because despite it opening it is basically completely inaccessible once assembled. The cargo bag is also a hinderance during the first bag as it constantly flops open. This is fixed during bag 2 with a rubber technic piece to prevent the latch falling open. After bag 2: After bag 3: After bag 4: After bag 5: After bag 6: The two halves of the escape pods just slot together but are secured after sliding into place on the ship. Lots of storage for weapons and for a spare shooter projectile. Phantom docked Some nice under-side details. Cargo bay access.... This is the only way to get to it. Spares: This was pretty fun to build although the four identical wings were a bit dull. The shape of the ship is pretty well rendered with nice angles, the cockpits and gunnery stations close nicely except for the top turret which has gaping holes. The weapon storage in the center and side compartments is a nice touch. There is one HUGE and GLARING problem with this set - where is Sabine Wren? The sixth member of the team seems like a much more logical inclusion than a single random stormtrooper. There's even a place for her to sit (behind the front gunner station). Presumably she'll follow in a subsequent set.... Edited by Scott-S6, 01 June 2014 - 08:56 PM.
Thanks for the review! Do you mind looking at the Phantom's box and saying if any of the parts are made in China?
Denmark, Hungary, Mexico, Czech Republic
Thanks!
Thanks for the reviews! These are the two sets among the new summer line I'm most curious about, I love the Ghost and it's crew and the Phantom is a cute and little elegant ship as well, I'm looking forward picking these up as soon as I can, thanks again for the pics, however I scrolled through the building process, because i don't want to spoil the fun
Scott-S6, on 01 June 2014 - 08:43 PM, said: Is this a new piece? Nope, this piece has been around a while. Piece #2653, its first appearance was in 1991 as part of set #6542 Launch & Load Seaport. Its first appearance in (old) light gray was in 2000, in set #1355 Temple of Gloom. That groove is supposed to be a track for the rails of part #32028 and others like it.
Thanks for the review 'Scott-S6', I'm impressed.....they look better than the CW sets, though DSS's again.....oh, well it wouldn't be Lego Star Wars without them ! At least these two sets together look cool......hmm, might buy them even though I don't collect SW stuff any more. Brick On Review On 'Scott-S6' !
Thanks for the review! Some of your photos are upside down by the way I was expecting the Phantom to be disappointing and it was, but the Ghost looks like an interesting build and I like the overall shape of it
The 'Ghost' really looks like a chibi 'Falcon' :. Man that Stormtrooper is ugly.
Thanks for the review, but your photos are really made in a hurry. It's not about posting reviews first, but doing them in a way the reader wants to follow it. For your next review, please take some more time in doing it and a least rotate the upside down images. There would be more to add, but for now I leave it at that. Thank you.
Nice ships, but I'm not the fan of new stormtrooper helmet design..
These were the first two new sets I picked up (along with the Mos Eisley Cantina) and I am happy with both of them. The UK price of Â£69.99 on The Ghost was particularly pleasing as I was expecting it to be a bit more expensive than that.
Thanks for your review on these sets, In my opinion the "phantom" makes no sense with its capacity to attach to the "ghost", its just the way to drain more money from our wallets because it barely has any play features other than that and it looks pretty lame alone, I actually think that the "ghost" looks better without it, regarding to your review, its always good to have an early look at these new sets, thanks again.
Agreed, I pretty much just got it for Ezra and Chopper. I'll also be compelled to get whatever set includes Sabine.
Good heavens--Brickset is telling me that the Phantom is $25 US for 234 pieces, or two minifigures and a flying brick. That's crazy. I like the concept of both ships, but I think I'm only going to get these if they turn up on clearance. Is there much room for the characters to move around in the interior, though? I like ships where the characters can actually play around inside as opposed to being stuck in a cockpit. (Which makes me wonder how Ezra is supposed to get into the main part of the ship short of putting on his helmet, opening the cockpit, and floating outside.)

As a counterpoint to this comment, I actually quite like the phantom ship. It reminds me of more classic Star Wars ships, bulkier and less sleek. I am not so much interested in the minifigure, but I have got the phantom at home waiting for me to have a spare evening to build it.
I've reviewed the Ghost on my own site.. It's a good model, just not great fun to build from my perspective. I think it's also Â£20 over priced, but that's a license for you. My other issue is the White gives it too much of a polished feel, it's a rebel ship and needs a darker, worn look. I understand there is only so much they can do with colours. I also wish they'd spend more time on the under carriage with these models (i'm not expecting full technics, but 2Ã—2 Slide Shoe Round pieces to rest on is weak). Aside from that it's a really sturdy ship and it'll be great for kids as it has lots of playability, even without the Phantom.
Bare in mind rebels takes place in the early stages of the rebellion. I like the set. Though seems a bit repetitive. Review was very detailed, thanks! Edit: was supposed to be quoting the user above me, apparently the quote button doesn't want to work on my tablet. Edited by aaroncb, 08 June 2014 - 01:49 AM.
Thanks for the review, that mini astro-droid looks cute! Is the Stormtrooper helmet a new mould, or the old mould with a new print? I agree with others, it looks ugly and well... too detailed? I think Lego prints look better when they're simpler.
Is Zeb's head made of rubber or hard plastic?

It should never be that steep. The torso doesn't even look like a stormtropers.
For someone who is only usually interested in the OT and some PT sets (avoided CW like the plague) I decided to take the plunge and buy these two sets. I'm not usually bothered with the EU stuff but these sets and characters look good and are much closer to the OT than anything else. The Ghost was a nice build and would make a great play set for a kid, especially with the Phantom add on. If the cartoon is a hit then I can see the Ghost becoming quite iconic.

I'm probably in the minority. I actually love some of these type ships. The clunky old freighters and some of the more distinct oddballs from the EU and not simply the classic OT ships. Stuff that looks great parked next to the MF. I love the Sith Fury and the Jedi Defender (OK the Republic Striker is a resounding MEH!) I wish they would have done more along these lines. Stuff like Dash Rendars Outrider and the D5 Mantis from SWTOR. Or the SWTOR Smuggler ship.
REVIEW - 42030 - VOLVO L350F WHEEL LOADER INTRODUCTION The Nuremberg Toy Fair is always an exciting event when it comes to revealing new LEGO sets. This year was no exception. We finally got to see visuals of the upcoming Technic Flagship. This time LEGO teamed up with Volvo to create an impressive version of the Volvo L350F Wheel Loader. In this review we will find out how TLG's interpretation compares to the actual Wheel Loader and whether it's worth the whopping 220 euro you need to fork out to own this bad boy. The designer behind this model is Uwe Wabra, who has designed other great models like the iconic 8258 Crane Truck and the 8285 Tow Truck. It took him about eight months to design the Volvo L350F. Volvo Spirit Magazine "The Nuremberg Toy Fair in February saw global toy giant the LEGO Group unveil its latest flagship model from LEGOÂ®Technic. With 1,600 individual pieces and the largest individual element ever created for the brand, the Volvo L350F wheel loader is not simply one of the companyâ€™s 2014 star performers â€“ it is just as impressive as the real-life machine it is based upon." Read more... Volvo Press Release Volvo Construction Equipment and LEGOÂ® Technic have joined forces to create a miniature remote-controlled L350F Wheel Loader in Volvo livery that not only drives, steers, lifts and loads just like the real thing it also converts into an equally impressive hauler. Read more... Credits Before we continue I would like to thank LEGO for providing the set and the possibility to publish this Exclusive review. Furthermore I would like to thank Volvo and Superkalle (our LDD Moderator) for giving me some very useful Volvo insights. All images can be clicked for hi-res versions. SET INFORMATION Number: 42030 Title: Volvo L350F Wheel Loader Theme: Technic Released: 2H 2014 Part Count: 1636 Box Weight: 3541 gr Box Dimensions: 57,5 x 47,8 x 12,0 cm Set Price (MSRP): 219.99 EUR DE / 169.99 GBP / 249.99 USD Price per Part: DE 0.134 EUR / UK 0.103 GBP / USA 0.153 USD With a price tag of almost 220 euro, this is the most expensive Technic flagship to date. The average price of 0,134 euro part part immediately makes clear that this is no ordinary Technic set. A high price per part normally indicates that a set has lots of special parts, like motors and other Power Function elements. THE BOX The box measures 57,5 x 47,8 x 12,0 cm which is equal to the height and width of the box for the 42009 Mobile Crane Mk II. The main difference is that this box measures a depth of 12 cm instead of the Crane's 9 cm. The additional 3 cm is necessary for housing the new Bucket, which will be discussed later. The difference in weight between the Crane Mk II (4172 gr) and the Volvo (3541 gr) is about 631 gram which is not that much, taking in account that the Crane has 970 pieces more (2606) than the Volvo (1636). One thing is sure; this box will leave little room for other Christmas presents under the tree later this year! FRONT SIDE The front of the box shows an impressive picture of the model, no surprise here. Like with most bigger models the size of the model is printed on the box. When finished, this model will measure a length of 58 cm and a height of 38.5 cm. The front also shows a Power Functions section stating it has "fully remote-controlled driving and digging functions.". The bottom right shows the large number of Power Function components this set contains. BACK SIDE The back side shows the B-model which is the Volvo A25F Articulated Dump Truck. The preliminary image of the back side explicitly showed an iPad with the digital building app. The iPad didn't make if to the final box, which makes you wonder whether the iPad instructions won't be available at all. Could it be that the size of the B-model is pushing the boundaries of building with the iPad app?! Another possibility is that the iPad app will be available later than the release of this set. INSIDE When opening the flip-up cover some cool facts of the real Volvo are revealed, together with a picture of the Power Functions and a demonstration of the manual functions. There's also a picture to emphasize the green engine. Name: L350F Horse Power: 540 HP (397 kW) Weight: 52 metric tons Bucket Volume: 6,9 m 3 INSIDE COVER The inside of the cover is devoted to the Power Functions. Again all the PF elements are shown. Two remote controls are used for operating the boom and driving the vehicle. It's not necessary to switch between these functions. Three small pictures explain how the Power Functions are controlled. SIDE The side of the box shows the actual size of the bucket, which measures a width of 18,2 cm! Now it's clear why the box needed to be bigger than last year's flagship. CONTENTS OF THE BOX The box contains: 14 Bags 1 Booklet 1 Sticker Sheet 1 Bucket 4 Yellow Rims 4 Tires 9 Power Functions Components BAGS The box contains 14 bags in varying sizes. Business as usual so far. BOOKLET One of the first times we encounter a single booklet for a set this size. When you have built the 42009 Crane you might have seen this before. The first production runs of the Crane included 6 booklets, which later changed into a single booklet. I really appreciate a single booklet, since it more or less reflects the size of the model. STICKER SHEET Not only does the sticker sheet contain stickers for the A-model, but it includes stickers for the B-model as well, which is pretty unusual. This does mean that you either need to remove the A-model's stickers when you are building the B-model, or buying a few extra parts dedicted to the B-model's stickers. HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This section describes the unique and/or highlighted parts. We'll start with the massive Bucket which obviously is the star of the show! BUCKET This type of bucket is called a Spade Nose Rock Bucket. It's primary use is lifting blasted rock and the spade nose is to obtain maxium penetration when digging into the gravel. On a real bucket, the teeth are interchangeable, because they wear out. Volvoâ€™s range of buckets is very comprehensive, encompassing buckets for all types of jobs and all types of materials; from rock and stone to ore and wood chips. Type: Spade Nose Rock Bucket Capacities: 1,8 â€“ 7,5 m3 Applications: Hard and stony material, shot rock and where good penetration is needed. Options: Pin/hook-on, bolt-on edge, welded teeth & segments. Using a real Volvo with spade nose bucket, you could easily haul over 200 LEGO Volvo boxes and probably more than 300 LEGO Volvo models. The following two images show a comparison in size with the Bucket formerly known as the Big Bucket. The older big bucket is used in 8265 Front Loader. As you can see the previous version can easily fit inside the Volvo's Spade Nose Bucket. Makes you wonder how big the finished model will be!! The distance between the upper and lower holes for attaching the bucket is 5L, where this is 3,5L for the older bucket. POWER FUNCTIONS COMPONENTS The number of Power Functions components is unprecedented. No other Technic set has such a vast array of PF components. Admittedly, the 8043 Excavator also has 9 PF elements, but that set only contains M-motors. 1x Battery Box 2x Infrared Receiver 2x Remote Control 1x M-motor 1x L-motor 1x XL-motor 1x Servo motor All of the four available types of PF motors are included in this set. The new L-motor and Servo Motor are found in the 9398 Crawler and it's Exclusive Edition counterpart, the 41999 Crawler Exclusive Edition. The L-motor is also available in the beforementioned Crane Mk II. What's special about this set, is the return of the XL-motor. This motor was about to become a rare PF motor, since it hasn't been used in an official set since 2009. The last Technic set it appeared in was the 8258 Crane Truck (also by Uwe Wabra). What I really like about the XL-motor is it's coasting behavior. Coasting is performing a natural deceleration of a motor when the power is removed. In simple words; the motor doesn't immediately stall after you stop applying power to it. This results in fluent vehicle deceleration. The L-motor doesn't coast which results in the vehicle abrubtly stopping. I very much dislike this shocky behavior on the crawler, so I am glad TLG used the XL-motor for propulsion. Although it had probably more to do with the torque (40 N.cm for XL vs 18 N.cm for L) than the coasting behavior. WHEELS For the first time we get to see the Wheel 56mm D. x 34mm Technic Racing Medium, 6 Pin Holes in Yellow, which is great for bigger construction vehicles. TIRES I was hoping the, so called, Unimog tires would make their way into an official flagship set at least once more. So I was glad to see TLG apparently had the same thought and used these great tires for the Volvo again. WHEEL AND TIRE ASSEMBLY Below is a picture of the complete wheel and tire assembly. ENGINE CYLINDERS Technic Engine Cylinders come in two variants, Cylinders with Side Slots and a newer version Cylinders without Side Slots. The newer version only got produced in light bluish grey, up until now. One of the characteristic features of Volvo machines is their green engine color, originating from the Penta Corporation. Volvo was founded in 1927 and the first engines were bought from Penta Corporation who made green engines, and so just shipped the same color to Volvo. In 1935 Volvo bought Penta (which became Volvo Penta, the marine division). The engines were continued to be painted green. All engines back then were petrol engines. Volvo's first diesel, VDA, was made in 1945. From the 1950's some engines were painted red, but mostly these were for Volvo Cars, and were petrol engines. As for production Diesel Engines in heavy machinery and trucks, they have always been painted green since the start. THIN LIFTARMS The Black Thin Liftarm 1x7 is not very special, but it doesn't appear in Technic sets that often. The Yellow Thin Liftarm 1x6 used to be pretty rare, since it was only included in the 8457 Power Puller. However, last year this part got reintroduced in the 42024 Container Truck. The Light Bluish Grey Thin Liftarm 1x5 with Axle Holes on Ends was introduced in Black in 2013. This is the first time this part appears in another color. AXLE AND PIN CONNECTOR The Yellow Axle and Pin Connector #6 - 90 degrees was last used in the Technic 8258 Crane Truck in 2009, until it made it's comeback in 2012 in the 5885 Triceratops Trapper. Just like the XL-motor Uwe Wabra is using this part again in a Technic set. PANELS Finally we can see a small selection of panels. Mostly old style Yellow Panel Curved 11 x 3 with 2 Pin Holes and a single Black Black Panel Curved 11 x 3 with 10 Pin Holes. PART LIST Here's the complete list for all 1636 parts. BUILDING EXPERIENCE Enough with the boring part...let's build a Volvo! CHASSIS You start building the chassis and after a few steps, the pendular rear axle is taking shape. The small turntable proves to be an asset to the Technic parts catalogue. Another useful part is the Steering Portle Axle, which is rapidly becoming the workhorse of big Technic vehicles. Ordinarily it's placed vertically to provide higher ground clearance, but as you can see, it can be used horizontally as well. Here you can see images of the front and rear sections, which will be joined a bit later in the build. The front and rear section joined together. The wheelbase does not reflect the size of the finished model. Here's a picture of the articulation mechanism of the vehicle. PF MOTORS The four motors are equally divided over the front and rear section. Because two of the motors (M and L) are placed in the front section, there's no need to transfer gears or axles from the rear section. Three (M, L and Servo) of the four motors are placed vertically, while the XL-motor is placed horizontally in the back. VOLVO D16E LAE3 ENGINE The Volvo D16E LAE3 is a straight six-cylinder high performance, low emission turbocharged diesel engine with direct injection, air-to-air intercooler and Internal Exhaust Gas Recirculation (I-EGR). The engine has a one piece cylinder head with four valves per cylinder one overhead camshaft. Furthermore, the engine has wet replaceable cylinder liners, replaceable valve guides and valve seats. The Engine with V-ACT (Volvo Advanced Combustion Technology) features split injection, optimized air handling and turbocharger with waste gate. High torque at low engine speed gives the engine its characteristic feature: quick response at low rpms, even under load. The three white Round Pin Connectors with Slot are the engines oil filters. Two of them are normal, high flow filters and the third one is a fine filter that is optimized to catch finer particles, but has a slower flow. When engine load is moderate and oil/lubrication need is also moderate, much of the oil is directed to the fine filter. When the engine is working at maximum, all oil is instead passed through the two normal filters. LOAD SENSING HYDRAULIC SYSTEM The L350F features an intelligent load-sensing hydraulic system. Two variable piston pumps provide exactly the flow rate and pressure required at any given moment in time, distributing the power where itâ€™s needed, when itâ€™s needed. When flow is not required in the hydraulic system, all engine power is diverted to the drivetrain. This provides smoother operation, lower fuel consumption, and more precise control of machine and load. You always get full power, regardless of revs. The LEGO version uses three Linear Actuators instead of an hydraulic system. NOTE I made an error placing the LA. The top LA in the picture below should be flipped, resulting in the attachment point being at the bottom instead of the top. Thanks to Jantjeuh for pointing this out. CHASSIS AND BODYWORK At this point the chassis and bodywork are almost finished. LOADER Z-BAR LINKAGE The L350F is a heavy duty, primary production loader intended for multi-shift, high production applications. High breakout force in the digging position, high lift capacity and fast hydraulic speeds are the essential requirements for a primary production loader. The Z-bar linkage is a field-proven, effective linkage in this loader size class. The refined geometry is the same for both standard and long boom and allows common bucket range with an open design. Below is an image of the Linear Actuators operating the Z-bar linkage. ROTATING LIGHT A small detail I particularly like is the small rotating light on the top of the cabin. Other models use a transparent 2x2 Round Brick which is way too big. This smaller version fits better! STEPS The image of the real Volvo on the inside of the box shows the steps on the left side of the vehicle, while they are mounted on the right side of the LEGO version. After some research I found out that the L350F used to have the steps on both sides of the cab, but it was not a safe solution for the operator when he had to climb up the steps into the cab with a lunch box. So late last year Volvo changed the design and eliminated the steps on the left side and made the steps on the rear fender standard. Another cool feature that Volvo included was the â€œremote door openerâ€, so as the operator approaches the machine, he presses the remote door opener and the door opens automatically and the entrance lights shine down on the steps for additional safety when climbing into the cab when it is dark. INFRARED RECEIVERS The infrared receivers have been placed nicely behind the cabin, hardly visible. Although the box states that V2 receivers are included, there is no V2 sign on the ones I found in my set. FINISHED MODEL It took me approximately 7 hours to finish this model. I reckon most of you will finish it in about 6 hours. FRONT VIEW The finished model looks stunning! It's really massive. Even though I love the looks of this model, I can't help wondering why TLG didn't make some wheel caps to fill the rims and make the wheels look more massive too. REAR VIEW The rear looks great as well. In this picture the battery box is clearly visible, but from a normal viewing angle, it's almost hidden from sight. BOTTOM VIEW Just as you would expect. Nothing out of the ordinary to see here. THE GAP The side view of the Volvo is one of my main concerns. While the rear section looks massive and lifelike. The front section looks unfinished, especially the part in front of the cabin. Also, the bottom of the first section of the boom could use some more bricks to make it look more immense, just like the real machine. PARTS LEFT Quite a few parts left, even three Axles (5L, 6L and 7L). Of course nothing the bucket can't handle! FUNCTIONALITY This model has quite a few functions. The main four functions are: Articulated Steering Driving Raising and Lowering the Boom Operating the Bucket Besides these motorized functions, there are some manual features. ARTICULATED STEERING Wheel Loaders typically use articulated steering. Articulated steering is a system by which a four-wheel drive vehicle is split into front and rear halves which are connected by a vertical hinge. The front and rear halves are connected with one or more hydraulic cylinders that change the angle between the halves, including the front and rear axles and wheels, thus steering the vehicle. This system does not use steering arms, king pins, tie rods, etc. as does four-wheel steering. If the vertical hinge is placed equidistant between the two axles, it also eliminates the need for a central differential, as both front and rear axles will follow the same path, and thus rotate at the same speed. Long road trains, articulated buses, and internal transport trolley trains use articulated steering to achieve smaller turning circles, comparable to those of shorter conventional vehicles. Articulated haulers have very good off-road performance. (Wikipedia) Steering is controlled by the Servo Motor. There was some disappointment in the community because the steering looked very jerky in the videos from the Nuremberg Toy Fair. I must admit I didn't like it either. The Servo Motor has two modes, on (in either direction) or off. This means there's no gradual steering mode, it's hard left, hard right or straight on. This is illustrated in the images below. Playing around with the LEGO model, I experienced that the steering indeed is a bit jerky, but for playability it isn't as bad as it seems. A solution with Linear Actuators would have been more realistic. But since the Volvo basically is a kids toy, I can accept the jerky steering. LIFTING THE BUCKET The boom and bucket are also operated using Power Functions. Both the boom and the bucket are operated with the remote and both functions are working properly at a nice speed! LIFTING LOAD The Volvo is powerful enough to lift it's own weight. That no surprise, since it can lift up to 1 kg of load!! ENGINE BAY The engine bay can be opened from various sides for maintenance, like changing the oil filters. Opening the back reveals the big green 6 cylinder engine with the cooling fan. The D16E engine has a hydraulically driven, electronically controlled cooling fan and intercooler of the air/air type. The system not only results in quieter operation, but also lowers the fuel consumption. BATTERY REPLACEMENT Replacing the batteries in the battery box is fairly easy. Remove the two axles with red bush and unlock the black long pin with stop bush and you can easily detach the battery box from the vehicle. COMPARISON WITH 8265 Inevitable is the comparison with it's predecessor; the 8265 Front Loader. For a non-flagship set, the 8265 already was an impressive Front Loader. The following pictures show how big the Volvo actually is. It trumps the old Front Loader in every way. SUMMARY The LEGO Volvo is nothing short of spectacular! I might even go out on a limb by claiming that this is one of the coolest LEGO Technic models....ever! If not THE coolest! True, there are better looking models. True, there are technically more advanced models. However, this models combines a lot of factors, like playability, looks and the sheer size is stupendous. Adding the Volvo brand and stickers is the icing on the cake. My all time favorite Technic model is the 8043 Motorized Excavator, since this model combines, looks, functionality and playability. The Volvo shares the exact same properties, but it contains a lot more cool parts than the Excavator, a wider variety of Power Functions for instance, a gargantuan unique bucket and Unimog wheels. In all fairness; reading my own summary, I can only come to the conclusion that I like the Volvo even more than the Excavator! Even though the price is pretty steep, I would definitely recommend getting this set. PROS Offers lots of playability No need to switch between functions Finished model is massive LEGO Volvo looks like a genuine L350F Gargantuan unique bucket Unimog wheels CONS The gap in front of the cabin Front section looks unfinished compared to the rear section Omission of wheel caps to make the wheels look more massive Jerky steering due to servo motor (minor con) SCORE Design 9: Stunning looks and the sheer size is impressive. Volvo stickers are the icing on the cake. Build 8,5: Very enjoyable build, but nothing too spectacular. Functionality 9: Four different fully remote controlled functions, combined with some manual functions. Playability 9: Fully remote controlled and no need to switch between functions. Parts 10: It doesn't get any better than this. Entire range of PF motors (including XL Motor), Unimog Tires, unique Yellow Rims and much more! Value for Money 8,5: Although the price is pretty steep, you get a lot of bang for your buck. 9 Bucket Size Does Matter! Hope you enjoyed it! Thanks for reading and please rate this set at the top of this topic!
Jim, on 02 June 2014 - 03:20 PM, said: It took me approximately 7 hours to finish this model. I reckon most of you will finish it in about 6 hours. 4 hours here. The build seems pretty straightforward, way easier than 42009, for instance.
Very, very nice review. The images and writing are excellent. Thanks a lot! As I said when the first images appeared, I like the back a lot, but the front (from where the cabin starts) is just plain ugly in my opinion. I'll probably get this set (on a discount as always, I never ever buy full price) since it's a nice parts pack. And, I can always mod the front to whatever I like; it's Lego!
Very detailed and nice review Jim really makes me want this model more than ever
Fantastic review Jim,I only hope Santa will be kind this year....
Great review write up, and fantastic pictures, as we have come to expect from you! Regardig the model, I definitely agree with you that it looks better from certain angles than others! I am really impressed by the massive size of the thing! My main complaint is still the choice to use a servo for the steering... I would have expected (and was hoping for) more new parts, but it's nice to see the 5L thin liftarms/levers in LBG at least.. I think I will pass on this set, and instead just buy the bucket alone!
Thank you very much for this gorgeous review and the perfect pictures.
It's nice to see that it has AWD and some suspension in the rear, the steering could have been improved with a small linear actuator and M motor. (It would cost less than the servo)
By the way; what is the distance (in studs) between the upper and lower holes for attaching the bucket? If I remember correctly, it is 3,5 on the previous big bucket, and I never quite understood why they didn't just make it 4

What I like is that it is almost a full PF set, just missing the lights. Are the receivers V2?
Cool review! Thanks, this is my new set priority!
Great review, the size of the thing is scary - must of us will need to buy a new larger shelf just to display it! Not sure if I am ready to shell out US$250, though. Also, how well was the bucket packed? Any chance these might get damaged in shipment?
That's one hell of a review you've made Jim! Not being into Technic, but this set looks pretty nice.

Lights would have been the cherry and the cream and icing on the pie on the cake etc The box shows the V2 sign on the receiver. But to my surprise, these are old receivers. So TLG might be getting rid of their old stock. I reckon future Volvo sets will have the V2 versions.

Thanks Jim! Great surprise you have done!:) Am I right that distance between pivot point and axles is the same for front and rear axle?
Excelent review Jim! Realy enjoyed it and looking forward to get this beast! Looks realy fun to play with and offers an excelent selection of parts. Two questions; -Does the servo motor turn 90 degrees left or right or is it limited in any way? -Does it come with v2 receivers? (couldn't realy see it in the picture)
After reading this review a second time, iam not sure if i buy this set at release date or if i order only the bucket. I have my replica and my big bucket loader. So why a third?
Nice review as usual, Ted. Good job on the photography as well. As for the set - it looks pretty cool, but there are definitely improvements (aesthetic and functional) that can/should be made. Eagerly awaiting Jurgen's Ultimate 42030 Still, probably won't buy it but rather order the new parts. Price is too high IMO. Edited by jantjeuh, 02 June 2014 - 05:03 PM.
now we want a video :o Edited by Timoonn, 02 June 2014 - 05:01 PM.
Excellent review! Thank you! As impressive as this set is due to the size, it just doesn't capture my attention. I wanted it to make me want to sell my 8265 but that is not the case. The tires still look too small for this to be an L350F and the front half of the chassis as you said looks unfinished and rushed. Then there is the price for this set! $250! Just for that alone I think I will pass.
aol000xw, on 02 June 2014 - 04:14 PM, said: Are the receivers V2? V1.
Sorry. Actually there are a few. The Box The boxis pretty basic. It is the normal Exo-Force layout, and features a pic of Aerobooster, hayato, and the product information. The back features how to dimantle aero defender from booster pack. A comic clip, other sets, and the missle launcher can also be examined here. The Parts Okay. So I will just examine the important parts. Including three, silver and blue sonic phantom wings, a new gold Ha-Ya-To MF, a new missle, gold stickers and pieces, plus a lot of white and blue parts. And don't forget that DSS!! The Build It was fun to see how it was built, and the final design was very playable. It was not unbalanced, and resmbless the sonic phantom, in a way. I would recommend this to you, as I did to myself. I promise my next reviews will be better, a lot like *yoda* reviews. See ya later! Regards, ~VBBN~
Thatï¿½s a very neat first try! *y* But maybe for a review without pics a bit more description would be useful.... How sturdy is that thing, in which way is that little blue mecha wonder attached to the jet engine, are those three engines a little moveable for posing? *sweet*
Nice review, although, well, Asuka pretty much summed up what could be improved. But I'm looking forward to future reviews. *y*

Its a big build, and I also had a new TV to install tonight, so I thought Id post what Ive done and not keep you guys hanging. Heres a few general pics. A member on here said the box was big....WOW you sure weren't kidding. Its freaking crushing me!!!! The bags are number coded again...so thats good! Now a look at the DSS....Spose its not too big considering the set size. Also check out the wheels...they're HUGE! Like...LEGO for giants?!?! I do not know the name of this Mech, but Its a sweet looking Mecha! Its got an element Ive not seen before for the claws, almost like Wolverine! Which is totally sweet. Good colour scheme, white and orange...looks better in the flesh than on the box. Its similar to the other basic Mecha builds. Lots of jets, and a nice load of detail on here actually. Its a great start! Ill do the main thing tonight and tomorrow, so expect the review for the actual devastator then. So far so good!!!!

Too bad it's taken. I suppose we'll have to come up with something different... badger? No... X-D Good review for Badg- Blazing Falcon, I mean- I haven't seen one yet. Better than on the box? Well, now I really need to get it. Maybe I'll try too make my own out of Sky Guardian. Don't suppose anyone would be able to scan the instructions? I like the orange background behind the pics. But maybe you could link the pictures?
Wow.. that is a big box. 8-ï¿½ And nice pics so far.
No worries, I can post a bigger picture. Ive started Mob Dev, and so far its excellent! I am pleasently suprised. Its got a turning mechanism, so as when you lean it side to side, the wheels move so it can turn. Youll see tonight when I post the next part of the review, and I will happily link to Hi-Res photos.
First of all some Hi Res pics of yesterdays. Yay! I finiseh teh awesomeness of teh Devastator. Well I have mixed feelings. Its got some good techniques, and it is quite nice but I actually feel its just a bit over the top - Its a little too big. You can see too much of the chassis. Anyway, thats the bad points out of the way Heres some pics! Now for some of the nice touches. Drop down, and flip open "trooper" holsters! Small pod ships that attatch onto MD. In closing, I am quite happy with it, and theres a lot of nice ideas. Could of been a bit better though. 7.5/10
Thanks for the review. As a great Exo-force Fan, I'm not too enthusiastic with the second 2007 batch (aero booster / mobile devastator / golden tower). Lego goes too much in the "oversized" sets those last 2 years. Good design, good playability but a lot of empty spaces :-/ . And it becomes a problems for the collectors like me : I have no more room to store those huge sets. Think about Striking venom, mobile defense tank, Sentai fortress... I guess I'll skip the mobile devastator mainly for this reason. But I might consider acquiring it at half price during a sale somewhere, just for the sake of completing a little my collection :-P
Id say thats very wise my friend. Wait for sales, pick it up for the Blazing Falcon, and then put the other pieces including those behemoth wheels to good use in some MOCs. Oh yeah, it should be mentioned you get a lot of Robots lol. Mecca One, Silver dude, 2 silver dude tops for the ships, and 6 bronzies.
Very interesting review. *y* This set has some good playability, an interesting concept and a brave color scheme.... But itï¿½s not my cup of tea. That blazing bird of prey is the best part of it IMHO. 8-|
I still like the MD, but the guys at Lego could have made it $100 and filled up those spaces with cool guns and all that stuff, now to the Blazing Falcon...Whoa.It is so cool!I love the idea of using gold fingers(hey, wheres James Bond?! :-P ), so many jets, love the claws, 10/10, but the MD, 7/10 for me.
Its a shame because the turning mechanism on it is really good.
Thank you |-/ , now I have to buy it. X-D
Thanks for the review ReZourceman. I really like the Blazing Falcon, the MD is pretty cool too. Thanks for the great pics. *y* *sweet*
well, i'll be seeing it at my birthday (as i said, i don't have a AFOL's budget....)--This year is going to be primarily robots!
ReZourceman, on Jun 1 2007, 11:04 PM, said: Its a shame because the turning mechanism on it is really good. Maybe Iï¿½m a little 8-| , but what is that turning mechanism and how does it work? *sweet*
Also, do those Devastator legs down there serve a purpose or are they for the 2 Devastators mounted in the aircraft if they want out? :-/
Those legs are for detail, but yeah Lol...Im sure the other robots could use them Haha. As for the mechanism, its hard to explain so Ill try to remember to get some pics up tonight. If I gorget PM me to slap me. :'-( :-D

I thought the mech was a MOC at first glance. It looks absolutely terrible. Pieces seem to be added randomly and the color scheme looks like a 8-year old made it. Gundam-colors are good, as long as you spread them out properly. It looks completely random to me. A shame really, the first wave of EF mechs was quite good.
Asuka, on Jun 3 2007, 03:09 PM, said: Maybe Iï¿½m a little 8-| , but what is that turning mechanism and how does it work? *sweet* From what I can see in the pics, its the same mechanism used in the Clone Turbo Tank. (and I think this method is not particularly good btw) Basically, they put the front and rear axles on 'pendular suspensions'(you can find this on some big US trucks) meaning the axle can tilt laterally. Except rather than have the tilt axis be properly level, the one in front is angled upwards, and the one in back is angled downwards. This means, if you lean the body of the vehicle manually with your hand, you put a force onto those pendular suspensions and due to their funny angling it makes the axles twist to face the direction of the lean; giving a steering effect. Now, what I dislike about this system, is that it means steering and suspension become connected to one another. When rolling over non-level ground the suspension will cause a random steering action. Additionally, I just don't like the idea of grabbing hold of the vehicle and pushing the entire body left or right to activate steering; this is almost the same as what we do when there is No steering to begin with. Hand of God type steering systems are much more interesting, but I just may just be spoiled by all the nice Technic sets... Edited by xenologer, 05 June 2007 - 02:32 AM.

Ah, hmm, thanks, that sounds like an interesting and somehow funny feature, although of course a Hand of God steering is much more precise and reliable.
Recently I got mine and I don't regret it. ;-) This thing is so friggin' huge, it almost puts Striking Venom to shame. :-D And the Blazing Falcon is so cool looking with the claws. :-$

no negetive responses to this shambles of a set? i think this is one of the least aesthetically pleasing designs ever, in complete disarray and makes little sense and i'm rather surprised this is actually a set. Even the mech looks like it was made out of scrap mechs and to look like a rabbit and the engines all over the arms and legs really bug me too. Not even one of the cockpits is completely enclosed. I criticized this set when it was announced and i will continue to do so. I guess its got some decent parts though.
Beware the Batman was the latest animated TV show featuring the Dark Knight and the first one to be completely CG-animated. Set during Bruce Wayne's early years as Batman, it replaced Robin with Katana as Batman's sidekick and focused on his lesser known villains, completely leaving out A-listers such as the Joker. It seemed like an interesting premise at first, but ultimately turned out to be the series' downfall as it was so unpopular that it got cancelled before it even got halfway through the first season. Clearly The Lego Group did not know how short-lived it would be when they decided to (very loosely) base a set on it. So, is the set any good despite being based on something so unpopular? Or does it crash and burn like the cartoon that it drew inspiration from? Let's solve this riddle in this special review celebrating both the 6th anniversary of the Eurobricks Reviewers Academy as well as the 75th anniversary of Batman! Set Number: 76012 Name: Batman: The Riddler Chase Theme: DC Comics Super Heroes Subtheme: Batman Year of Release: 2014 Pieces: 304 Minifigs: 3 Price: Â£29.99 / US$29.99 / â‚¬34.99 S@H description: Quote Pursue The Riddlerâ€™s Dragster and call in The Flash to catch him! The Riddler has robbed the Gotham City bank and is getting away in his ultra-fast dragster. Pursue him with Batman in his sleek new Batmobile, but watch out for the bombs being dropped by the dragster. If The Riddler manages to get away, call in help from The Flash, The Fastest Man Alive! Will he arrive in time to save the day? Only you can decide! Includes 3 minifigures with assorted weapons and an accessory: never-before-seen Batman (with new suit) and The Flash, and The Riddler. S@H Bricklink Brickset The Box The box features the the new design with blue comic strips in the background and for some reason they changed the "DC Universe" logo to a rather generic-looking "DC Comic" logo. It also has the new type of minifigure lineup box that has a green background and only shows the minifigs from the waist up in a three-quarter view. I don't like it very much since I liked it better when you could clearly see if the minifigs have leg printing or not. The back features the usual silly comic book sound effects and pictures showcasing the play features of the set. The green background goes well with the Riddler theme. The Contents Inside the box you will find two instruction booklets, a comic, a small sticker sheet, and three numbered bags. As usual, the comic is nothing more than an advertisement for the current wave of Super Heroes sets, so I wont get much more into it here. The instructions also have the new light green background which gives a nice contrast to the build, especially the dark Batmobile. There is usually only one building step per page, which works for the parts where it shows the full vehicle, but when it is showing only a small part of the build such as the spoiler as shown below, it feels like there is a lot of wasted space on the page. Also, the shade of green of the background is a bit inconsistent as some pages have a lighter shade than others. Things like the part call-outs are pretty clear, though, so the build is easy to follow. As is tradition, some of the odd-numbered pages have a ghostly image of three minifigs in the top right corner. In these instructions, the minifigs are Batman, the Flash, and... Man-Bat for some reason. How TLG's decides which minifigures to depict in instructions still remains a riddle to me. There are some rare pieces in this set. One of them is a pearl-gold crowbar which stands in for the Riddler's question mark cane and appears for the first time in this color. I'm sure most people would have preferred a new mold, but it's close enough I guess. At least it's better than the red crowbar that he had in the Funhouse set. There is also a few of the curved 2x1 slope pieces which were introduced this year and only appear in four other sets in green. That radar/snowplow piece appears in dark bluish gray for the fourth time as well, and the 10x6x2 curved windscreen makes its first appearance in trans-orange since the Mars Mission sets in 2007. The Minifigures There are three minifigures in this set, but only one of them is a new character and probably the main reason for most people to buy this set: the Flash. He is one of the main Justice League members and was kind of overdue. As I've already joked about in a previous review it's odd how we got Aquaman before Flash, considering how much more popular the Scarlet Speedster is. But better late than never, and I think the wait paid off. He looks great overall, especially his head. I was not a big fan of that bucket-like helpet that he had in Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes and I don't think giving him no headgear at all like Captain America would have quite worked either, so I'm very happy that they found a good middle-ground between headgear and no-headgear by giving him a mask that only covers half of his head like they did with the Swamp Creature from Monster Fighters. This allows him to have his signature lightning bolts on the side of his head without making his head look too bulky. The Batman minifig in this set comes with a new suit based on the one he wears in Beware the Batman which comes as a welcome deviation from the other two variants that we keep getting in most of the DC Universe Comics sets. However, aside from the torso printing and the dark gray hands, it's pretty much the same as the TDKR Batman, so it doesn't feel all that new. The third minifig in the lineup is the Riddler in a racing suit. Apparently he has given up riddles and complicated schemes and is just cruising around Gotham robbing banks now. Seriously, who thought this was a good idea? It's so out of character and he doesn't even appear in Beware the Batman, so this just seems like a wasted opportunity to get one of Batman's lesser known villains or any new villain for that matter. How cool would it have been to get Professor Pyg and Mr. Toad in their oldtimer instead? On the bright side, we finally get his bowler hat in green and he comes with a new gleeful expression. The Flash is based on his New 52 costume and is pretty accurate for the most part. The only thing that's a bit off on this fig is the lack of yellow boots which are a prominent part of the Flash's costume, but since hardly any Super Heroes figs ever get leg printing for some reason, it's hard to get mad at it. Still, why TLG is being so skimpy with leg prints in this particular theme remains a riddle to me. Batman also looks pretty close to his design in Beware the Batman, except his suit is (very, very) dark gray instead of all-black. Maybe they thought it would look too boring in black or maybe they based it on that misleading teaser image where Batman's suit did look more gray than black. Since the Riddler never wore a racing suit, I don't have a suitable reference image for his minifig, so here is an illustration of his most recent depiction in the Arkham games instead. At least the bowler hat is accurate... All three minifigs have back prints. I like how they gave Flash different shoulder blades than Batman. Riddler isn't exactly the muscular type, so instead of a defined body, he gets a scarf. I guess if you're going to drive a dragster through the city, you might as well look fabulous while doing it. Another advantage of Flash having a molded mask is that it allows him to have a double-sided head. His second face has an angry expression. Batman also has an alternate face, but it's the same stupid grin as always which I'm really starting to get tired of. He's getting a new face in one of the upcoming Lego Movie sets, so hopefully we'll see more variety in the Super Heroes theme soon as well. The Build The first bag contains the Riddler and the parts for his dragster as well as the Flash. Flash's mask is inside its own little baggie. Even though the entire first instruction booklet is dedicated to the dragster, there is really not much to it, so it's a fairly quick build. And no, I have no idea what that red 2x2 round plate underneath the front is for either. The second bag contains Batman and the chassis and driver's cabin of the Batmobile. At the end of this bag, this is what the Batmobile looks like. It looks a lot like a Batman version of the vehicle from Blade Runner, doesn't it? To the Bat-Spinner!! Bag number three has all the parts for finishing the rest of the Batmobile. When finished, the Batmobile looks quite good. It has a lot more of a racecar look than previous Batmobiles. It's not a perfect recreation of the vehicle from the cartoon. The windshield is far too big, the wheel covers at the front are missing, and some parts are too blocky, but the general shape is there. This is the third Batmobile Lego has released (not counting the Tumbler and UCS version) and I think it's my favorite. It just looks like a realistic, fast and powerful car whereas the previous two looked a bit silly with those oversized bat wings in the back. It has a very sleek, aerodynamic shape, especially when you look at it from the side, and the golden wheels and trans-orange windscreen compliment the black well. It looks quite intimidating from the front. If you're a criminal, you wouldn't want to see this coming at you. On the back, it has two trans-red radar dishes to represent the rocket engines as well as some pearl-gold cones and a gray Technic piece. We will see what these are for in a moment. Complete Set & Play Features With both vehicles finished we're ready for the big chase! Who will win? My bet is that if Flash can't catch up to Riddler's dragster, the Batmobile certainly can. The dragster doesn't look that great on its own and it looks even more pathetic next to the beefy Batmobile. It really makes no sense for the Riddler to be driving a dragster anyway, not just because it's out of character, but also because it's completely impractical to drive a vehicle that can't turn inside of a city, even in the inexplicably deserted streets of the Gotham City depicted in Beware the Batman. Any other vehicle would have made more sense. Heck, even that weird jetpack that he had in the Bat-Tank set from 2007 makes more sense than this. But enough ranting, let's get to the fun part of the set, the play features. Aside from zooming the vehicles around the room, there are a couple of other things you can do with them. The Batmobile has some hidden flick-fire missiles which you can reveal by pushing down the pearl-gold cones in the back and launch by pressing the gray Technic piece. Hidden flick-missiles are my favorite kind of flick-missiles, and the mechanism works reasonably well. In order to seat Batman inside, you have to take the windshield off completely. I would have preferred if they would have built it on a hinge or made it somehow so that it would slide open like in the cartoon, but it's not a huge flaw. The dragster also has some weapons. There is a little black ball with a trans-orange stud that is meant to represent a lit cartoon bomb attached to the back of the dragster. It pops off when you push down the spoiler and make the dragster rear up. This is a neat idea, but it ultimately fails because the spoiler is attached so loosely to the vehicle that it tends to just get bent down. In fact, it's impossible to move the dragster at all without the spoiler spinning around, getting crooked, or even fall off completely since it is built onto two hinges and stuck on pole on which it can freely rotate. It's the worst spoiler design I've ever seen. There are also studs for attaching the bags of money and the set includes a banana for the Riddler to throw in the Flash's path to make him slip. Between this and the cartoon bomb, I think the Riddler has been watching too many cartoons. Then again, a bomb can be a very effective weapon because some days you just can't get rid of a bomb. Ratings Design: 3/5 - The design of this set leaves a lot to be desired. The dragster looks weak, despite the ridiculously large engine, and the loose spoiler is terrible. The Batmobile on the other hand is quite decent. While it could be more accurate to the source material, it looks cool and more realistic than previous Batmobiles. Build: 4/5 - Nothing too challenging, but there is enough SNOT and Technic going on that it keeps the build interesting. Minifigs: 3/5 - The Flash was a highly anticipated minifig and he looks very good, except for the lack of boots. Batman is basically just another Batman, but the new torso print is appreciated. As for the Riddler, if you can get passed the fact that he's wearing a racing suit, he looks pretty good, and it's nice to finally get his hat in the right color. However, this outfit doesn't make him very versatile and I would have much preferred to get him in his iconic suit. Playability: 3/5 - The Batmobile is very swooshable, the dragster not so much. Each vehicle has one weapon play feature, which makes for a decent amount of playability. Parts: 4/5 - Nothing too out of the ordinary, but there are some rarities among them, and they're all very reusable, so overall pretty good. Price: 4/5 - At 11.510 cents per piece, this is has a fairly good value. Overall: 3/5 - I really wanted to like this set, but the designs of the vehicles and minifigs were just too lackluster to rate it any higher than average. I'm glad we finally got the Flash and I'm sure that if TLG wouldn't have been so clever to throw him into the set, not many would have bought it. The Batmobile has a cool new design, but it's not the most iconic nor the most accurate Batmobile. And the dragster is just awful and makes no sense in the context of the set, although I guess if you don't mind the racing suit, this gives you a cheaper way to get the Riddler. So unless you're a completist, my recommendation is don't buy it and wait for better versions of these minifigs to come out. There are rumors of a 2015 set with the Flash, Gorilla Grodd, and a Bat-Mech, which already sounds way better than this set, so you might not have to wait very long.

To end this review, here is a visualization of what the Batman from Beware the Batman would probably say if he was actually pitted against an A-List villain: Beware the Hipster Batman by Oky - Space Ranger, on Flickr
A most excellent review Oky! The dragster looks okay, though the front just seems far too simple for me. The Batmobile certainly looks more promising- even though it's not completely accurate, it's still a nice looking vehicle by itself.
Nice Review! I always thought that the Dragster was just okay, but for some reason I do really like the Batmobile in this. Perhaps it's because it's the one most akin to the New 52 appearance. I never actually knew what that little ball was for on the back of the Dragster. Consider me enlightened.
Another great review! I loved BTB and mid season they started bringing in the A and B Listers like Harvey Dent, Ra's al Ghul, Killer Croc, Man Bat and Deathstroke. I recommend you check it out.
This was a minifig purchase for me, but the more I look at the batmobile, it's warming up to me. I prefer the 2012 one though. That dragster on the other hand is awful, and I don't see why the Riddler would use one.
Great review Oky! Admittedly the set had some decent parts like the miniature green slopes, but other than that... meh.
I don't think it was based of BTB. That's never really been stated that this set was based of that. It was a misconception when first images of the set came out. Edited by The Indecisive Clutch, 27 August 2014 - 07:03 AM.
I'm seriously considering buying this set for the Batmobile, and the minifigues, not so much for the sad looking dragster.
Thank you Oky for this review. I owned this set and built it. It was a fun and enjoyable built especially with the Batmobile. The Flash minifigure was actually the main pull factor for me to get this, while I find the Dragster for the Riddler is a little below average. Still, I enjoy the overall building process.
Initially this set didn't interest me much, but Flash was just too much of a draw. Luckily, the Batmobile turned out to be fantastic! I don't care that it isn't wholly accurate to anything; it's simply a great LEGO car/model all around. I feel a similar way as I do to the car to the Riddler, which everybody seems to bash. Yes, he doesn't 'make sense,' but he's still an excellently designed minifigure. Of course a Baddie we hadn't seen before would have been better, but for what it is this Riddler looks excellent and delivers a better color of Riddler bowler plus another head design with purple mask, useful for making comics characters with purple masks (or just Riddler variations). I'm quite pleased with him, racing jacket and all. The dragster too isn't really exciting, but it's not bad besides for the spoiler. It's a fine dragster. It's much better just as a toy/model than some of the other vehicles LEGO has produced for this line, like Batman's plane in the Steam Roller set or odd bike in the Batcave set. The bomb feature actually works pretty well if you just tip back the whole car in any way other than pressing on the spoiler. Comparing this set to the Aquaman one, this one comes out a much better set to me overall. The Aquaman set was ALL about the minifigs; the Ice Bat thing was just kind of dumb. Though I bought this set mostly for Flash, it's actually a great SET too.
I got this set, and feels like a waste of money IMO. The Batmobile is ugly, the build felt tedious, but the dragster is surprisingly OK. The Flash and Batman are both great, and even though the Riddler doesn't fit, he's still okay. The Arctic Batman set is a much better set for less money.
Great review, and I liked the jokes you slip in. (cartoony bombs ) I liked everything about this set, of course, the poor dragster needed quit a few mods due to lousy design, the Batmobile and minifigs are fantastic right out of the box! I have never seen the TV show as I refuse to pay for cable. Anybody like to point me in the direction where I can maybe see it for free?

So glad riddler has his own car
I had this Â£10 off its Â£30 (practically) retail price in LFCC (London Film and Comic Convention). Its pretty cool. I love the Flash minifigure.
The Renegade Runner, also called the RR was released in 1993 together with the bigger pirate ship the Skull's Eye Schooner. The ship has a crew of four and consists of 171 pieces. It has no center sections. The ship is the second ship of the Pirates line using the 12 studs wide hull pieces. Some pictures of the whole ship. And the stern. I was quite disappointed there was no cabin, but it was probably impossible for LEGO to make a simple cabin design on a little ship like this. The front.. A view from above... And the cute Figurehead! I really like this one. Simple and yet so effective. Here's a close up of the single cannon. In case you've never seen the thin Prefab hull sections, I give you a picture of the bottom! Here is the crew of the ship. It's good they didn't choose the captain Roger fig this time. And the accessories. Including the cool compass! And here you can find a parts inventory from Peeron. The brickshelf folder where you can find the pics of this review. I give this ship a 3 out of 5. I think LEGO could have put more effort in building this ship.Some things I don't like are the blue bits in the colour scheme, the lack of an anchor, the lack of a steering wheel and I think the stern section could also use some work. Generally, not the best ship LEGO made, but also certainly not the worst one. I'm happy to own this little boat, and if you are really a serious Pirate LEGO collector, you should really try to get one of this! Enjoy! Now its your turn to write reviews or leave your comments and opinions!!!
So you gave it a three, Mr. Reviewer.... hmmm. I really like this little ship for some reason. Being one of the smaller crafts in the pirateship-collection I was surprised by the details it came with: a compass, two sails and more weapons than minifigures. The sail of my copy (from Bricklink) has been ironed a tad bit too long by the former owner leaving a circular black/brown spot on the middle of the canvas. (It looks like your front sail, Mr. Tiber, could use some ironing, just not too long....) A while ago I made some decks inside the hull of this little ship and a helm, but those modifications are long gone now and the ship stands in it's original pride somewhere in my parents house. I like these reviews.
I really do think that this is a brilliant little pirate ship. It has great sails, two jolly roger flags in both sizes, an excellent assortment of weaponry, along with four figs and the hull itself. The two negative points are the lack of an anchor and blue pieces. (Is it necessary for a ship of this size to have a wheel?) 4 out o' 5 for me.
A very nice review with good pictures, thanks. *y* Itï¿½s really a neat little ship and a very useful medium pirate set, especially when MODed a little with a helm and a cabin.... The revolving cannonï¿½s doing the job, and that compass is simply great. Itï¿½s a 4 for me. *sweet*
The Renegade Runner Pictorial Review has set sail! I shall frontpage this on Classic-Pirates.com and later in the week create a special information page with more details about the Renegade Runner than anyone can handle!
The votes in the poll have been reset to 0... :-||
Why did that happen? Anyway, I gave it a 4. The only thing this ship is really missing is the helm. It would've only taken about 3-4 more bricks to add it, nothing Lego couldn't have handled. Apart from that it has anything a medium-sized set like this one should have (I don't think such a small boat would need an anchor). And I actually like the blue pieces many of you are complaining about - it's a nice change from typical black. And one of the biggest virtues of this set was that it was perfect for those who wanted a pirate ship but didn't have enough money to buy one of the big ones - it was this set that made it possible for them.
I think it's a nice little ship. definitely should have had a small cabin. And a steering wheel. I love the single cannon idea though, not every ship needs a thousand cannons. -TD

This is a pretty cool little ship, they can't always be big so I gave it a 4/5.
I say a three.It looks as if Lego took spare pieces, slapped something toghether, and called it a set. But I does have a good side.It has 4 figs,a revolving cannon,and an aresenall of weapons.
I think my view of this ship is coloured by the fact that it was my first... Ah.. the nostalgia... *sweet* Not something I think I'd buy now... but it's still kinda neat and cute.
After having drooled over all the ships in the catalog for a long time, this is the one I was finally given for Christmas '93- so even though it's kinda the "budget option" it definitely holds a special place in my heart. In fact the reason I found this forum is because I was wondering where my ship went and wikied Lego Pirates. I'm even thinking of buying a black seas barracuda, i'm not sure where this wave of nostalgia came from!

i like it...is a small but nice ship...i think one important reason to buy that set is Captain Ironhook...the dragon figurehead is cool...and the colours are cool... This is much better than CBC... In any case RR can be crashed easily by Imperial Flagship or SES ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR

Would you mind sharing the sails? :) As I have mentioned the big Skull printings on sails really really annoys me How did you manage to remove the pattern? I think it could at least have some steering device since it is a sloop class it probably dosen't need an anchor I like this ship though *wub* The front deck/swivel/gatling guns are a nice feature Very handy in taking out the crew of another ship However when put alongside the CC this ship is puny and outgunned In real life Pirates didn't have Huge Men-O-War instead small sloop's like this were faster and easier to navigate. The dragon figurehead is one of my Fav figureheads Henry Morgan was the only pirate to ever even use a Men-O-War Mainly because he was a privateer Piranha

Piranha, on Jun 21 2007, 02:12 AM, said: How did you manage to remove the pattern? I took a scan of the original sail and basically drew a new one in Coreldraw over this scanned version.
3/5 (had a hard time choosing between a 4 or 3 :-/ ) There are some key things missing as already mentioned: Mainly the steering mechanism and anchor. When available in stores, this was a good cheap ship to buy to beef up one's pirate forces for a small price. *y* I personally don't own this set, but me bro, duke, does; so i've seen it personally growing up. The brick count and construction is pretty stingy, but it definitely is much better than the cross bone clipper *n* :-X If there is a review of the cross bone clipper ever. there should be a negative number available in the poll (at least a 0) :-D P
I have finally reviewed the Renegade Runner: 6268 Renegade Runner is a fine sloop and The LEGO Groupï¿½s first foray into two-hull piece ships. It has a simple sail configuration consisting of a main sail and a head sail which is rigged in place in place using proprietary LEGO string. Some have criticised the Renegade Runner of having of having an insubstantial design, that is to say it could use more pieces to flesh out the structure of its upper deck, although this criticism is probably better reserved for its later counterpart 6250 Cross Bone Clipper. The colour scheme works nicely which touches of grey, blue and red contrasting against the brown hull. There are some nice details like a compass and figurehead made from a Dragon Knight plume. Jolly Rogers on the mast and stern indicate the nature of the vessel but the motif on the main sail is overkill and somewhat limits the setï¿½s building potential beyond that of a pirate vessel. The mini-figure count seems ample for the shipï¿½s size and sufficient weaponry is included to arm the pirates for their next plunder! The Renegade Runner is captained by Ironhook which is a refreshing change from the overly abundant Captain Roger/Redbeard, but unfortunately the crew consists of generic mini-figures found in every other pirate set. Overall the Renegade Runner is a nice smaller ship to add to any Pirate LEGO collection but those intending to convert it into a non Pirate vessel will need provide their own sails.
I think it's a nice smal ship, with nice lines. It's not too expensive and can be a nice adittion to a harbour. As u said it could use an anchor and a steering wheel. I'd add 2 mid sections too i think, and rebuild the thing completely :'-) Nice review mr. Tiber! Edited by Captain green hair, 28 September 2007 - 12:18 PM.
She got a 3 out of 5 for me. The big skull on the sail is a bit overkill and a slight extention in her hull would have been nice but that having been said the name of the ship is 'Renegade Runner' and it's called that for a reason... Being a sloop and designed to outrun and outmanouver her bigger imperial competitors is what this ship is all about. I actually think lego gave a bit of thought here... A ship that was designed more for raiding, getting past barricades and escaping quickly. She's ideal for smuggling. The single rotating canon can be easy to manouver and this compensates for the lack of firepower making her a match for ships like The Sea Lion/Imperial Flag Ship who more times than not only have one cannon ready either Starboard or Port. The other aspect we all keep forgetting is that the smaller you are, the harder you are to hit. The Dark Shark/Black Seas Barracuda is just target practise and really if you were a pirate facing what is almost always superior numbers and firepower from the imperials I know I'd want something I can get away in. :-$
Hey guys, I just had a quick question. I know the Renegade Runner does not come with a steering wheel, but is there room on deck for one? I wasn't sure, and couldn't quite tell from pictures other than the fact that it is pretty close quarters.

Great review Mr. Tiber *y* .To bad i cant buy one because its very good
This year is not only the 6th anniversary of the Eurobricks Reviewers Academy, but also Batman's 75th Anniversary! Therefore, it only makes sense that TLG chose to give out a version of Batman from the Dark Knight's long and rich history as one of their exclusives at the San Diego Comic Con this year, and I was lucky enough to get one. But is it a good minifig? Is it worth buying for ridiculous prices on the aftermarket? And what the heck is Zur-En-Arrh? Let's find out! To the Bat-review! Set Number: SDCC036 (on Brickset) Name: Batman of Zur-En-Arrh Theme: DC Comics Super Heroes Subtheme: Batman Pieces: 6 Year of Release: 2014 Availability: Given away at SDCC 2014 on Saturday, July 26 at 12:30 pm. The Package The package is the same clear plastic clam shell with a bubble for the minifig as all the other exclusive minifigs from this and last year. It features a nice stylized picture of the minifig in the background and the "San Diego Comic Con International 2014 Exclusive" logo in the lower left corner. The back features the address of the Super Heroes product page on Lego.com and the usual small print. Like last year, the card board insert is folded and includes a picture on the inside. However, this year the picture is not a backdrop to display the minifig on, but instead it's a mini-poster of the minifig. While it may not be as useful, the stylized illustration of Batman of Zur-En-Arrh does look pretty cool. I just wish it would have depicted him in a more interesting pose than just angrily standing in the rain. The fact that it looks like he's wearing purple diapers doesn't really help. The Minifigure And here is the minifig itself. He is quite a friendly-looking fellow, isn't he? His costume is bright and colorful. Why? Because he's tacky. It's great to get Batman's cowl in a new color, and this is the only Batman aside from the Electro Suit one to receive leg printing. I still don't understand why TLG is being so stingy with those. It's disappointing, though, that they changed the cape from a purple Batman cape (as seen in the official image above) to a regular one. What you may not know is that there are actually two different versions of Batman of Zur-En-Arrh. The first one appeared in a comic in 1958 titled "Batman - The Superman of Planet X!" in which Earth's Batman is transported to a planet called Zur-En-Arrh where he gets Superman-like powers. Yup, that happened. This sort of what-if story was actually quite common for comics in the '50s. This story was later adapted into an episode of Batman: The Brave And The Bold. Anyhoo, once Batman arrives on Zur-En-Arrh, he meets that planet's version of Batman, a scientist named Tlano, which is who this minifig is based on. Image courtesy of the DC Comics Database The second version appeared in Grant Morrison's "Batman R.I.P." storyline in 2008, after the DC Multiverse got rebooted. This was a much more gritty take on Batman of Zur-En-Arrh. I didn't read the comic myself, so all my knowledge of it is based on what I read about it on wikis and reviews of it, so don't quote me on this, but basically, this is a version of Batman who has gone off the deep end. He got druged and brainwashed by an evil organization so that his mind shuts down when he hears the trigger phrase "Zur-En-Arrh". In order to protect himself from this, he creates an alter ego called the Batman of Zur-En-Arrh by removing the Bruce Wayne part of his mind, leaving only a crazed Batman who runs around the city violently hunting down the criminals that tried to destroy him. So yeah, perfect material to base a Lego figure on. Image courtesy of DCU Comic Book Reviews In order to represent both versions, TLG was generous enough to give this minifig a double-sided head, one side with the Tlano face, and the other with the crazy Bruce Wayne face. Also, this is the first SDCC exclusive minifig to get an accessory, not counting Bard the Bowman since he's not really exclusive. The Bat comes with, well, a bat ironically, which is one of the weapons that he used to torture and defeat the villains with. The fig also has some nice back printing. You can clearly see that in one of the pockets in his utility belt, Batman of Zur-En-Arrh is carrying the Bat-Radia, which is a nice touch. The Bat-Radia is a device that can issue electronic molecules that cause controlled disturbances in the atmosphere - or just an old radio that can override Arkham's security system - depending on which version you're talking about. Here is a look at the head without the cowl. Tlano's face is pretty much the usual Batman head, except with a big happy smile, which fits the campy tone of the comic that he is from. Bruce Wayne's face on the other hand is very different. This one features a stubble and a maniacal snarling mouth. What I especially like is that his headband is tattered, which fits the grittier look of this version of Batman of Zur-En-Arrh and is a nice touch. Final Thoughts: I think this is a perfect Comic Con exclusive. It's a fairly obscure variation of a popular character that only true comic fans will know. And it's a character that we have gotten more than plenty of in normal sets, so unless you really want this particular version of Batman, there are many other ways you can get the Dark Knight. Plus it's a great way to celebrate the Caped Crusader's 75th anniversary. It is a very nice and detailed fig, and the fact that you can switch between two versions of the character with the flick of a wrist makes it especially awesome. My only gripe is that they used the wrong kind of cape, but it doesn't detract from the fig too much and the fact that they included an accessory kinda makes up for that. The packaging is nice too, although the mini-poster is kind of pointless. The only ones who would actually use that poster are little kids, and only about 1% of these sets will probably land in the hands of kids unfortunately. Still, it's better than nothing I suppose. This was a great souvenir to take home from SDCC, but if you didn't get it at the convention, I would only recommend buying it if you are a hardcore completist or a huge fan of Batman who actually knows what Zur-En-Arrh is. And no, you can't have mine, sorry. That's all there is to say about it. To conclude this review, since bashing in bad guy heads is too violent for Lego's usual standard, here is a more kid-friendly scenario to play out with Batman and his Bat-bat: Batterman by Oky - Space Ranger, on Flickr I hope you enjoyed this special review, and tune in for my next review - same Oky-time, same Oky-channel!
A very entertaining review Oky! You are very lucky to have been able to get this. Hope you enjoy this minifig!
This is awesome! Anyone got $400 to buy this off Ebay?
I don't know much about this figure, until I read things online. But I love Batman so I definitely want to pick this up. But those prices are ridiculous. Thanks for the review. Someone in my LUG got all 4 exclusives and the exclusive sets at SDCC...I always thought they were one per customer, but I guess not.
I am very lucky to have mine arive yesterday! And paid no where near $400. I was lucky to get it for about $170US. Then have it shipped to Australia. Its a great fig and will have pride of place in my collection. All so great review Oky thanks very much! :)
Awesome review! Zur En Arrh Bats is probably the most underrated character, and I thought he was always badass after reading RIP. I just wish that Lego gave him that one smiley face and give us the stubble face in a widely available set as that face is quintessential for a Batman minifig IMO.
Yuck, stinks of Comic Con! Great review though!
That smile on the face never ceases put a smile on my face.
Absolutely Fabulous minifigure! If I had Â£500 lying around, I would definitely get one!
WARNING! LARGE PICS! By tmmorow thell be resized. Damn my high res camera... On the 13th this month it was my Birthday. And after a few hours of annoying my parents, they agreed to get me some lego... Under 1 condition I have to modify it into a RC car. I agreed and to my delight I recived 8436. So lets start. Stats ---------------- Theme: LEGO / TECHNIC Year: 2004 Pcs: 1027 Figs: 0 MSRP: $90.00 (I got it for WAY above that.. 200 USD... Lego in Malta is EXPENCIVE! :-( ) The Box ---------------- This truck has 3 models, wich are shown all over the box. Here is the normal box. The flip thing flipped, Showing the other models. The Contents ---------------- Inside the box, theres you guessed it, More boxes! 3 infact. Numbered. As well as 2 manuals (a common sight nowadays) and no DSS ( ï¿½ Xwingyoda) ! Boxes in the box... The manuals and the single baggie outside of the boxes. Pins Galore... And thats just from 1 box! The Build --------------- The build took me 6 hours. With breaks ofcourse. Remove breaks and its a 4 hour build, but I rarely build techinc things so thats why it must have taken me so long :-) . The chassy is ready! V6 engine... Could have had a gearbox.. The Cab. Too bad you can't steer with the actual steering wheel. But thats because the cab can swing forward to show the engine. The Grabber. The only atatchment I built as I'm too lazy to built the others. The Big Picture ------------------ Over all I like it, recomend if you want to make a mistake whick you notice near the end meaning you have to disassamble half the truck ( X-D Happend twice to me). So heres a general pic with the arm in action. A general pic with the arm holding some deodorant. The Rating ------------- Parts 9/10 - Good varaity of parts, but could use one more ram... Build 7/10 - Not bad, took me a while was fun but easy to make mistakes (Not that thats a AFOL's problem, probably Im just clumsy) Playability 2/10 - Not much to do... But a great dust collector! :-P Coolness Factor 10/10 - I personally think its a very cool model Over all - 7/10 Not a bad model, looks cool but dont recomend it if you plan on playing with it or swooshing it around in the nude. X-D Again, sorry bout large pics. Resizing as we speak Type... I added a gearbox. Stauder *sweet* Edited by Stauder, 27 October 2007 - 08:27 PM.
Nice review! This is a great set! My girl friend bought this for me a couple years ago for my birthday. This set brought me back into lego! Ithink this was a fairly easy build by techinc standards. I have since made mine a dual rear axle (total of 3 now) and built a trailer spicificly for it. On a side note..... If you decideto build the crane attachment,you can still pull a 5th wheel trailer!
Nice review (they are not that large those pics)! Though I don't own this set it does appeal to me in a certain way, it looks like a decent truck with some nice pieces. You are having a hard time living in Malta with such high Lego prices....! :-)
Yes I am having trouble as a Lego Fan in Malta. They dont even import SW sets! *sing* But the BSB is avalible in a loval store and it anint too expencive... *Stares at wallet*
Thanks for the review. I have to say I found this model soooo disappointing at the time that it came out, because Technic had been so much more than this, and I had really looking forward to a new Pneumatic model, and in 2003 at least it seemed that there had been a revival in Technic because they had the very good backhoe 8455 http://guide.lugnet.com/set/8455 and recycled the crane truck 8438. Anyway, comparing this to the Airtech Claw Rig(the greatest Technic Model of all time of course) or even lesser pneumatic models like the tractor 8464/8459 http://guide.lugnet.com/set/8459, or the big backhoe 8455 http://guide.lugnet.com/set/8455, or even the medium sized log loader 8443 http://guide.lugnet.com/set/8443, shows how little they did with this model. Basically, this is a standard modern (meaning crappy gearless liftarmed excessively fared) truck chasis with a function arm of some sort "thrown in". 8455 - the backhoe was a pretty decent set, and marked the last time Lego did anything useful with pneumatics (8421 does not count because the pneumatids were basically useless). It's a shame really - nothing I ever did with Technic was ever as cool as the pneumatic stuff. Lego seems to have abandoned this, though.
Nice! Good review, great pics. That's a lot of pins. :-P Looks neat, the first (only) pneumatic set I've seen/played with was the submarine. With the detachable cockpit. It was awesome. This looks neat too, if only I had enough money to get the Castle sets and this. :-D *y*

I have to disagree. While i agree that its not the best techinc set that has been out, i have to say that it does have some very nice features. A V6 engine, tilting cab, steering, and 3 options for a rear lift mechanisim. Its obvious that this is the focal point of this set. I believe it gives it alot of flexability that other sets don't have. I built the folding crane on mine. While i admit that the pnuematics aten't very strong due to the placment, it does have some capability. But to be honest, i mainly choose this attachment because i wanted to build a trailer for it. Another high point of this set. 8438 i beilve is the best (stock) crane lego has come out with to date. Its the only set that i have from my childhood that is still toeghter. But more on that in a bit... :) gylman, on Jun 20 2007, 02:20 AM, said: Anyway, comparing this to the Airtech Claw Rig(the greatest Technic Model of all time of course) or even lesser pneumatic models like the tractor 8464/8459 http://guide.lugnet.com/set/8459, or the big backhoe 8455 http://guide.lugnet.com/set/8455, or even the medium sized log loader 8443 http://guide.lugnet.com/set/8443, shows how little they did with this model. These are all great examples. All have there high points,as well as there lows Just like 8436. BUt to be honest, if your going to crown a king of pnuematic sets, it has to be 8455 back hoe. With 10 cylinders, 7 switches, and two pumps, how can it not be? The tractor8459/8464 was a great set. Though it had little function, it did what it was supposed to probbly the best out of any techinc set ever made.

It's a shame really - nothing I ever did with Technic was ever as cool as the pneumatic stuff. Lego seems to have abandoned this, though. With an air tank, i beilve 8455 rivals even the mighty air claw rig! :-P BUt in all honesty, the air claw rig is a fantacic set. It preety much everything but a suspention. The turning radius could be a bit better though. As for 8421, i have to agree that lego dropped (litteraly) the boom on this one. 2 cylinders were obviously not enough, but what really gets me is that if they just completed the hose to the switch, that woulds have heled alot with the crashing of the boom when letting it down. But when an extra 2 cylinders are used, you can attually lift somthing other than just the boom itself. Making the it a very capable crane. BUt in stock form, it does need a alot of work. More than any other techinc set i can think of. Thats why 8438 is lego's best crane to date.
I certainly like 8455, but it does not live up to its potential. 8455 has a ton of pneumatic functionality - more than any other by far. It sits on my office shelf with no risk of imminent storage, along with Airtech, the Black Cat ModelTeam, and the Scudaria Truck. However, it has a flimsy feel to it - too light due to the use of liftarms rather than bricks, and probably a bit too small. It is very hard to control the movement of the pneumoatic powered parts - they open too fast, close too fast, and getting them to slowly and in a controlled way go to the position you want is almost impossible. It doesn't demo well to family and friends. Airtech is much more impressive that way. Again, this could have been partially remedied by having heavier elements, so the pneumatic power did not fling them back and forth. Also, the switches are too many and too close together. A 100% better model with exactly the same functionality, would have been 50% larger, 100% heavier, and used the extra space for an air tank somewhere. The reason I like the tractor so much is because it is very sturdy feeling, and because of the air tank you really can control it very nicely. It is almost the opposite of the 8455 - less function, but all the functions work really well. Also, it used a significant amount of bricks, not liftarms, which is a major plus in my books. And the liftarms were actually used in a useful way. And no farings. EGAD I hate farings. I have to confess that this is probably part of my bias against 8436
First of all, thanks for the review. I actually have this set and have always liked the look of it but I've never had a chance to open the box and actually build the thing. Secondly, I really enjoy this discussion between Gylman and 5150. We've had these before and I really enjoy reading all the comments about the pneumatics and functionality of the Technic sets. The last big Technic set I built was the tow truck 8285 Lugnet 8285 (it is still on my shelf) but I was disappointed in the overall functionality of the set. I actually reviewed it here last year if you are so inclined to wade through my ramblings Dunamis Review of 8285. At any rate, I have the AirTech Claw and it is a very nice set as well. I do have the 8459 and 8455 but have never taken the time to build them. All this Technic talk has made me want to break them out and spend the long weekend building them out. At least I would then be able to contribute more to this discussion. Unfortunately, I haven't seen much promise in this year's Technic sets. Although the new motor functions are intriguing, it seems that LEGO just continues to recycle the same models every few years. I mean, how many cranes, dozers, backhoes can we possibly have?

I think the tow truck was a great set, but like you said, needed more. First, it should have used pneumatics to lift the arm. As well as the rear lift mechanisim. I modded mine to do just so. It really adds to the set. Also the rear lift should have pivited. Still working on that one. dunamis, on Jun 27 2007, 07:38 AM, said: At any rate, I have the AirTech Claw and it is a very nice set as well.

If there are any legos that should be built its techinc. With all the functions they offer, it would be a crime to keep them boxed up any longer! :-P Trust me, both are awsome sets! You won't be disapointed! dunamis, on Jun 27 2007, 07:38 AM, said: Unfortunately, I haven't seen much promise in this year's Technic sets.

I'm attually really looking forward to the new bulldozer. This one could quite possibly beat out the airclaw rig as the best techinc set ever! X-D But i agree with about the rest of the techinc sets this year. It seems every few years we get a new crane, or forklift, or some kind of truck. But if you think about it, what are the most popular techinc mocs on brickshelf? The crane has to be the top. So i can see why lego keep them coming every couple of years. I remeber gylman starting a topic about technic ideas other than the tipical tractors, cranes and such. Once you start to think about it, its kinda hard to think up of somthing other than the tipical tractors and such. Espeacailly since it would need to have some kind of function. But if you have any ideas, we'd love to hear them!
Nice review. This set looks pretty good. I might've considered getting it. -ZotS

Well i can imagine that if lego get's their pneumatics division straight then maybe they can think Airtech claw rig + PF!!! Then again if the bulldozer really proves to be a great model why should they go back to pneumatics, The 8421 didn't work well, why shoould a new model. Back to the reviewed set, it looks kinda cool, but the back where the crane is looks kinda empty. very good front and style of the model though!

Just cause the pneumatics in one set didn't work well, doesn't mean that they should stop using them altogether. :-| Like Gylman and i were discussing, there are plenty of great examples of pneumatic set in the past. No reason that LEGO couldn't make more great models using them.
Thank you for that neat review of an interesting set. Although Iï¿½m not a very big Technic fan it seems thereï¿½s some decent playability coming with that model. *y*
I added a gearbox. I tought it would be good to post it here if somone else want to do the same...
