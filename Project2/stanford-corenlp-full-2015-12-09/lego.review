I had to give it a 5 as well......
  Positive
you all know why.
  Neutral
Another reason is cause that's how many I have (I think) , including this modified 3 master with working lanterns behind the ships wheel, and a MISASWB (mint in sealed and shrink wrapped box) of the original 6285.
  Negative

  Negative
So maybe you could create a a new thred whith some close-up pictures one day - if you'd like to share that kind of thing.
  Positive
5/5.
  Neutral
Such a wubbable boat!
  Neutral
Mister Phes, it may be LED lamps, which are small and convieniently fit into a 1x1 cylinder brick.
  Negative
Most likely to be attached to on of those flat batteries.
  Negative
Just what I think it is :capn: .
  Neutral
Even though this ship has no place in my 'modern' dock, I proudly keep it there anyway.
  Negative
:) It's just too beautiful- it deserves a place in my fleet.
  Positive
Though I must admit: I made a deck to go over the cannon pit so I could have some room.

That ship is 100% lego.

You know the 4 gray hatches that open up on the deck of the BSB?
  Neutral
And how there is a bit of empty space under there.
  Negative
Mine has a 9V light and sound box placed under the hatch so that the switch is easy to get at.
  Negative
there is then a 9V cable running up through the cabin to the back of the upper deck with a 9V light assembly stuck on top with 2 yellow round cylinders over the lights.
  Negative
I'd get some more closeup pictures but the ship is in storage out at the farm right now.
  Negative
(there isn't enough room in this house to store it all.)
  Negative
I give it a 5 as well.
  Neutral
It is a great ship.
  Positive
I used to have 3 of this set but recently sold a copy.
  Negative
Keeping 2 of this is enough for me since I decided to gradually downsize my Lego pirate collection.
  Negative
Within a week I sold a 6285 BSB, a 6278 Enchanted Island and a 6262 Kahuka's Throne.
  Negative
Last mentioned sets were sealed copies.
  Positive
Besides, from the big hull ships I also still own 3x 6286 (1 used), 3x 6289 (1 used) en 2x 6290 (2x MISB).

I was lucky enough that I discovered lego pirates in 2003.
  Negative
I went to LEGOLAND billund that vacation, and saw this ship (legend version).
  Negative
I prefered it over the black falcon's castle, and I still do now.
  Negative
I also bought 30 brown rowboats, wich I don't have a use for now... I was surprised how long it took to build this ship... It's a magnificient exemple from the time when LEGO used a whole lot of plates instead of the now chunky blocks of plastic... My version also got the new shooting crossed cannons, I like them more than the shooting ones.
  Negative
I'm going to break it apart, (well, I'm actually already stealing pieces from it...) for MOCs.
  Negative
The special thing is... it has 4 places for cannons, and they are all filled up.
  Negative
This is missing in most of the other ships.

My Padawans, After that political debate last night, I was in a building and reviewing frenzy so here is that glorious Naboo Fighter (NF) � and accessorly that Vulture Droid (VD) review !!
  Negative
Since I never had the first MF Naboo version, I was really happy when I learned that TLC was going to have a new Naboo and I have to say TLC made a real great set !!
  Negative
So here we go !!
  Neutral
1/Instructions & MFs Nothing really to mention regarding the booklet (it also has the moron drawings !!)
  Neutral
.
  Neutral
There is also that DSS !!
  Neutral
(Dreaded Sticker Sheet).
  Neutral
However the MFs are way more interesting !!
  Neutral
* The NF pilot is really a cool fig: great torso (that could be used for WWI pilots IMO) and it has a �bonus� cap when the helmet is not on !!
  Positive
Some will be annoyed by the fact that the head used is a normal fleshie smilley but not me since I love that head and since that pilot is a normal troup guy.
  Negative
* Young Anie is a real �cute� fig with a nice torso and especially with great hair piece (I really love that colour that is present on the VD).
  Positive
Also look at them both together hehe * Yeay, another R2 !!
  Negative
(Do you feel the irony in here).
  Neutral
No pics (G i wonder why :-P ).
  Neutral
2/The NF I love that ship and that version is really great !!
  Positive
The only thing I did not like (like always when DSS are included) is putting those darn stickers, especially that the yellow is not the same as the bricks :-| Next time use transparent sheet like with the VD !!
  Negative
That sticker is the only valuable one: The shape is really slim and really captures perfectly (or really next to perfect) of the actual NF.
  Positive
Here I have to say thgat pics are better than words so: The engines are nice.
  Positive
The only grip I would have is the the non use (like the UCS crapy model) of the trans blue part on the rear of the engine (Mod On !!)
  Negative
.
  Neutral
Unlike the JSF, the NF has 2 main playability aspects: * R2 can �slide off� (I don�t see the point but oh well...).
  Negative
The rear part where he stands goes down to �liberate� the little droid * Yeay another catapult under the ship !!
  Negative
On Kim�s scale ( X-D ), its a perfect set to swoosh in the nudes and a great set to chase cats (or others nuisance in an appartment :-D !!)
  Positive
3/The Stand Its a really nice small added feature to the set !!
  Positive
I feared that it would fire the gun when displayed but no !!
  Negative
Its nice to notice that the NF is inclined in the front when put on the stand.
  Positive
The thing that I don�t get is the use of the diver sub gun on the ladder (actually who cares).
  Negative
4/The VD Oh boy I really hate those stickers (Rant On !!)
  Negative
.
  Neutral
Anyway I have mixed feelings regarding the VD.
  Neutral
The colour scheme is really great, way better than the first version.
  Positive
Sorry I have no first version for comparison pics (I have dismantled all of them !!)
  Negative
.
  Neutral
The use of that dark tan is amazing, its such a beautifull colour !!
  Positive
Design wise I am not a fan due to the use of those droid arms on the wings and on the head !!
  Negative
It makes the whome ship filmsy like hell !!
  Negative
Personnally I would have made that colour scheme with the design of the ep3 VD.
  Negative
Oh well, its not the major aspect of this set anyway hehe.
  Positive
Hereis the VD in his 3 positions: Another great PT set.
  Positive
G, I am becoming such a SW nerd !!
  Negative
I was only a OT fan but those new ep1 sets are a thing of beauty !!
  Positive
Arghhh darn you Lego !!
  Neutral
That all for now folks, untill next time... *yoda*
Fantastic review!
  Positive
I might get this set depending on how much money I have left ;-)
This is great!
  Negative
Actually, I really like that the R2 can slide off, it shows that happening in the movies, and up till now it has just been left out!
  Negative
What I don't like, however, is that the stickers are a different color than the bricks...I'm starting to get really fed up with these color problems!
  Negative
Also, what about the shooting mechanism?
  Negative
Does it go off easily when swooshing, or you don't have to be careful?
  Negative

Ah a good question !!
  Positive
For once you can swoosh all you want with it without having a "rubber incident" :-D Unlike the Tie Bomber :-P The only thing to be careful is when you put the NF on its stand: you see that there is a whole is the stand and the trigger mechanism of the canon is suppose to fit in there !!
  Negative
Do it gently and no problemos !!
  Positive
If no, there might be an "incident" hehe !!
  Neutral
Swoosh On !!

Nice review as always *yoda* Will definatley have some of those.

Nice feature with the "escape-thing" for the astromech.

Is the "head" "turnable" on the VD?

Swooch On!

Very nice review, thanks for taking the time to do it.
  Positive
I'm partly cloudy on this set, it just doesn't do anything for me.
  Negative
The DSS makes it even less desirable.
  Positive
The N-1 does seem to be a much better design the the first one so that is a plus.
  Negative
The minifigs look good as well.
  Positive
A great review yoda as always and some great pics!
  Very positive
I too like the loading-unloading thingy for R2 :-D and what great minifigs *wub* .

I take it that the MTT was not in stock when you bought these 2 sets?

Still waiting for Bday money ;-) It was a choice between the MTT or those 2, and since we saw already loads of pics of the MTT, I thought that the SW community here on EB would prefer to see those 2 ;-) Am I nice or what !!
  Negative
Also looking at trhe price, the MTT will not get out of stock unlike the 2 others I imagine !!
  Negative
*yoda*
That must have been one hard choice to make.
  Negative
2 good sets or one of the best sets we have seen in years!
  Positive
I don't envy you that decision.
  Negative
Nice.
  Positive
The droid mechanism is a novel, if unexpected, touch.
  Neutral
Is it sturdy in holding the droid, or does it have a tendancy to flop?
  Negative
The dark tan is really nice, and I actually think the droid arms on the VD are quite good.
  Positive
It looks a bit more accurate now.
  Neutral
nice review *yoda* I hadn't the old set so I will definetely buy this set, nice figs, nice starfighter, nice flydroid
Neat set, not a SW fan but it looks like a heathly source of yellow and grey bricks.
  Positive
I'm really hating the stickers, especially the ones used to portray the guns on the nose.
  Negative
Stickers for emblems and such are... tolerable, but I really don't think they should be used to substitute actual 'hardware'.
  Negative
Once again, great set.
  Positive
A consideration I might buy.
  Neutral
Just for the figs and Naboo fighter.
  Neutral
The VD is O.K.
Nice review, I'm planning on getting 3 of these
I'm not a SW fan, but this lil'Anakin is so cute!
  Very positive
His face and the HP hair piece in dark tan, so nice!
  Positive
But spending so much money in this set just for this piece, no... Nice review.
  Negative
A non SW fan >:-)
Good review!
  Positive
not to sure about the stickers though but i'll get it anyway *vader*
Very good review!
  Negative
The pictures are very sharp and the light is perfect.
  Positive
I won't have any money this year to spend on SW (building a house), but this is certainly a set with a very high playability factor and a must-have for the SW-fans.
  Negative
Yep, beside those stickers I guess that this version is much better than the old "get shorty" one.
  Negative
Hmm....
  Neutral
shall I buy this?
  Neutral
I�ve already stretched my baby and I�ve also MODed a loading system for the astromech.... 8-|
Well Thanks again for the review :-) Wow The NS was quite nicer than I expected Love the Coelacanth logo on the side Too bad it is a sticker :-( R2 can slide in and out,cool Ric Olie is very nice and so is Anakin The VD I like much better than the orginal The side wings open up with out having to take them off and move them Now all we need is an EPIII version A must buy Piranha (MTT 8-� )

It captures the originals well.

On the other hand, I'm tight on money.

Excellent review and certainly an interesting set.
  Positive
Love the minifigs, hate the stickers.

Go figure.
  Neutral
At least the comparison shot of the two minifigs together made Anakin look a little less anime than I thought he was going to be.
  Negative
The eyes just look big when he's seen seperately.
  Negative
Whew.
  Neutral
Thanks for the review!
  Positive
We all get upset when we hear certain sets will only appear in the US, not in the rest of the world.
  Negative
That is by no means a recent phenomenon.
  Neutral
In fact, it�s always been that way.
  Negative
The X-1 Patrol Craft was one of those beauties that never made the European market, one that, before the age of internet, I didn�t even know existed� i got this set from Mike at the event, I wonder if he knows how rare and expensive this is... X-D The set appeared in a catalog of 1980 and hung around until 1983, outliving most of the other late 70-early 80�s sets.
  Negative
The basic shape of the model is really old style: just two wings put together, add a slope with a brilliantly shining space logo, a steering wheel and this shooting thing at the front and voil�: here�s your very recognisable classic space ship!
  Negative
Oh and don�t forget the tail and these small boosters!
  Negative
The green transparent windshield is unique for a spaceship of this timeframe though.
  Positive
Lego usually used sloped windshields or none at all, and most definitely not trans-green!
  Negative
Isn't this the best camoflaged space ever?
  Neutral
X-D The model is quite interesting.
  Positive
The pilot sits between two main engines which go all the way to the front of ship, becoming powerful weapons� hm� �snowspeeder goes classic space�, if you�re asking me� Those engines give the ship an over all look of a high speed fighter, but may be juuuuust a little too big for such a small ship, as if you put an engine of a Porsche into a small Fiat� X-D No sophisticated landing gear on this one, I�m afraid.
  Negative
Lego used to make it very simple: just a couple of round bricks will do.
  Negative
The box is compared to current standards very small and has all the classic elements of a Us box, like �interlocking pieces�, the name of the craft,� but in general, this is a great set.
  Positive
I wonder why I have seen this set somewhere :-D Very nice review Sne !!
  Positive
Cute little set I have to say !!
  Neutral
I love the size of those engines for a small set !!
  Positive
It really quick serious *beeeeep* :-D However I have a question regarding colours: did light bluish grey existed at the time X-D :-P ??
  Negative
Space On !!
  Neutral
*yoda*
lol!!
  Neutral
not bluish grey though, but good old fashioned old grey :-$ *wub* some parts are just severely yellowed, making the others look like anoter, brand new color i still have to clean up the set/box
Quote i got this set from Mike at the event, I wonder if he knows how rare and expensive this is... X-D Nooooooooo *vader*!

What have I done ...... ;-) Well at least I didn�t give you the MISB one X-D!

Glad you enjoyed it - it looks cool.

Nice review also *y*!

Seeing these old space sets bring back lots of good memories.

well either Mike replaced some parts including the red helmet, or the seller did, that's for sure, but that's ok, i'll just pick up a helmet some place else.
  Negative
some of the parts are seriously yellowed, but for some reason are very clean.
  Positive
I'm not sure what i'll do, but i may just keep the original parts together.
  Negative
Yellowed parts is not so great, but at the same time, they add a nostalgic touch to the model... :-$ it is btw, very normal that sellers change parts here and there.
  Positive
Very often there's an original brick missing, like a blue one with the space logo or the one with the white arrow.
  Negative
it's pretty difficult to check the goods on ebay that closely... anyway, not that it matters if you get a box in a good condition for a reasonable price, there's always bl
The X-1 Patrol Craft was long gone when the Cosmic Charger showed up in the catalogue of 1986, in my opinion, one of the golden years of classic space� but then all years with space are golden years� This new ship is a perfect example of Space�s new style and approach to small space craft.
  Negative
First of all, there�s the color combination.
  Neutral
Seriously, did you ever see space ships that look even better than those white and blue space ships?
  Negative
Blue was in fact, �color of the year 1986� if you check out the catalogues.
  Negative
nope, not the best camouflaged space craft ever... :-P Then there are the new, more sophisticated parts, like that blue-grey levers.
  Positive
Man!
  Neutral
We used to love those things!
  Negative
They were soooo cool compared to the old steering wheel!
  Neutral
:-$ Then there�s that blue part in between the levers.
  Negative
Don�t really know how to describe it, but according to BL it�s a �Control panel�, I never really used it that often and you can see on the photos why: it�s not all that easy to put it close to the pilot�s seat, if you put a pilot in to his seat, his legs are going to hit the upper section of the control panel� not good!
  Negative
So you have to raise the control panel, including the attached levers, at least one plate higher, making the levers fairly high to reach for the pilot.
  Negative
The result is the pilot�s weird position: this poor guy is going to need some pretty strong arms to keep his arms like that during a long flight!
  Negative
:-X Third, there�s the seat.
  Negative
This was lego�s solution to allow the pilot to sit down in a seat without having to take off his oxygen tanks.
  Negative
Otherwise all those poor astronauts would simply die, leading to a non-minifig space theme!
  Negative
We liked the seats at first, but we dismissed them pretty soon afterwards because they�re not really practical.
  Positive
You�d need a 4x2 zone to place to thing anyway, it makes it more difficult to create small cockpits, especially if you want the old 6x4 canopy to close and we never really found a way to use it somewhere else on the spaceship.
  Negative
In the end, all seats were dumped in the crappy parts bag� |-/ The fourth new thing was the nose, which turned out to be the most recognisable section of the space sets of the mid 80�s.
  Negative
The blue part at the front is categorised as a �wing� but it�s been used in �Town� for other things as well.
  Negative
Maybe that was the best thing about Lego in the 80�s: Space, Town and Castle more or less used the same parts for their respective models, so it was easy to go from one theme to another.
  Negative
The hull section of this spaceship, came, btw, directly from the �town� airplanes, the �hottest� thing in �town� of 1985.
  Negative
One last thing that�s pretty nice on this set are the wings and the rockets attached to them.
  Negative
I say �wings�, but it�s actually a tail section attached to a classic hinge.
  Negative
I guess these tails were lowered during flight and raised when in landing pattern.
  Negative
Nope, no technic bricks are needed here, just the magical power of a small child�s hands will do the trick!
  Positive
Those rockets, and especially that blue printed tile, were pretty nice as well� 8-� *wub* and take a look at that white spoiler!
  Negative
That was a great idea!
  Positive
*sweet* The Cosmic Charger was a very good �theme filler�: it�s not the mainstay of the space theme in 1986, not the eye-catcher, nor the worst set either.
  Positive
Sure, a coloured astronaut would have been better than yet another white, but oh well� :-) It would only last two years though� Soon� veeeeery soon space would be going in an entirely different direction� with breathtaking result�.
  Negative
*wub* *wub* *wub* *wub* *wub*
What a great little set!
  Positive
All these beautiful and useful parts like the hinges, that white spoiler thing and those Bricks 1 x 1 Round with Fins and 1 x 2 x 2/3 with Studs on Sides....
  Negative
It�s hard to find more excellent "space bricks" for the same price in a set I guess.

Martian Manhunter is available at Lego Stores and Shop@Home when you spend £50/$75 in March.

So without further udo, let's get on with the review!
  Negative
Name: Martian Manhunter Set Number: 5002126 Piece Count: 4 Minifigures: 1 Links: Brickset Disclaimer: Martian Manhunter will be known as MM throughout this review as his name is quite a mouthful Packaging The packaging is the standard polybag, could be spruced up a bit, but I don't know how you could.
  Negative
Here's the front, with MM trying to pull off a Superman pose as he flies past Earth.
  Negative
Superman had better watch out, MM's got some moves!
  Neutral
The back of the packaging is yawn, just like most polys.
  Negative
I do like the 1:1 picture though, as it adds some colour to the otherwise boring back.
  Negative
Anyway, enough of the packaging let's get to the... Contents!
  Negative
If you were expecting a bag full to the brim with parts, you'd be mistaken.
  Neutral
As you can see, there is no printing on the neck, which means this is from, *gasps* somewhere else (mind you, it says 'components made in China' on the packaging, so it wasn't that much of a shock, but still, ) Build Don't worry, I won't do a step-by-step build of the minifig with you, I'm sure you all know how to build one (but if you do not, I'd recommend you see a doctor immediately ) The Finished Set!
  Negative
Here he is, in all his glory!
  Neutral
As you can see, MM is a very detailed minifig.
  Positive
He even has printing on his legs (however that has become standard nowadays) and his face looks rather menacing.
  Negative
I also love the cape, it is a lovely blue- as you can see, I'm not very good with the names of Lego Colours, I need Aanchir!
  Positive
- but if you look underneath that cape, you'll find some delicious back printing!
  Positive
Looks great!
  Positive
Ratings (out of 5) Packaging: 3, standard polybag, could be spruced up a bit, but I don't know how you could.
  Negative
Contents: 4, only minifig parts, however all of a good quality.
  Negative
Would've killed for an Oreo piece though Build: 4, it takes 10 secnds at the most.
  Positive
Finished Set: 5, brilliant minifigure, one of my favourites!
  Positive
Overall: 16/20 Conclusion: I am very happy with this minifigure.
  Positive
Whilst some are questioning why we got a Martian Manhunter minfig before a non-exclusive Green Lantern minifig, I am just glad we got one full stop, and relatively easy to get.
  Positive
So go and spend your money on a substanial set at S@H, and I'm sure you will love this extra freebie on top of your order.
  Negative
Heck, get one on Ebay (for a REASONABLE price) if you're not keen on getting a set, as this minifig is not one you'll want to miss.
  Negative
Thanks for reading my first review here!
  Positive
I hope it's helpful to you.

It really is a shame we still don't have a mass market Green Lantern minifigure.
  Negative
I wish they'd included him in one of the new Batman sets instead of Robin or Nightwing.
  Negative
Nice review!
  Positive
Even though I want him, I am torn with this Martian Manhunter figure; he seems a bit of a double-edged sword to me.
  Negative
I love that we get another Justice Leaguer, especially MM, but I don't like that he's in a poly rather than a full on Watchtower set--which frankly is the only set MM would likely show up in.
  Positive
It's good that he gets leg printing; but on the down side he stands out as one of the few superhero figs with leg printing.
  Negative
Again, I will say that I hate the New 52 style (if nothing because of how much DC is shoving it down our throats to begin with).
  Negative
I guess I just wish the theme would be based off of the animated Justice League show; as Batman 1 was heavily based on the Batman Animated Series.
  Negative
--- I must ask though Sir Brickalot, would you perhaps be able to take a picture of MM with blue hips and green legs?
  Neutral
I'm interested in seeing how the 52 torso would look with a more JL Animated styled legs (granted lacking boot printing--get on that Lego!)
  Negative
Yeah, when I first saw the photos of MM, I was puzzled as to why he was wearing long pants.
  Negative
Just placed my order!

Hopefully my nearest LEGO store doesn't run out before next weekend.
  Negative
I'll most likely get the steam roller or a couple of Marvel sets.
  Negative
Either way my JL needs to add Manhunter to its ranks.
  Negative
I think you will be fine, it's like 75 bucks to get one, most kids can't bribe their parents into spending that much.
  Positive
lol Here is with the Flash just for you: Edited by eldiano, 03 March 2014 - 04:08 AM.
  Negative
Well, the clever, dishonest kid would talk to the folks, have 'em buy $75 worth of product, then return it.
  Negative
But some folks don't have that much money to tie up for a few weeks while that scheme plays out.
  Negative
And it would be an incredibly douchey thing to do.

I did not know you could return Lego, so I just bought all those useless sets for nothing and opened them... dammit
If you enjoy it, then it was not a waste!

Unless you spent your grocery or child support money.
  Negative
I ordered mine yesterday, so excited to get him in a week or so!!
  Negative
:D
Thanks all!
  Positive
I'll post a pic of that tonight Captain Nemo!
  Negative
I just got this guy and dig him.
  Negative
I don't notice any quality difference, if anyone was worried about that.
  Negative
I will be switching his hips and legs, however, to match a more "classic" theme.
  Positive
The New 52 can go play in traffic, as far as I'm concerned.
  Negative
I can't wait to get my hands on this minifigure!

As per your request Cap'n, here is MM with blue hips and green legs!

So... yeah.

Not too keen on it myself.

Hey everybody, I've been working on this review for some time and have finally put it up: Golden Guardian Review As usual there is a story with Bianca & Gavin from Fabuland Housewives: I got this right when it came out in order to do a review and then 80 people posted reviews of it, so I waited...and waited...and waited...and now I finally got it completed and posted!

Starwars4J, on May 9 2007, 03:40 AM, said: You almost want to make me start to collect those figs ;-) The Fabuland figs?
  Negative
They're great!
  Positive
I of course got a lot of mine in '79 when they first came out.
  Negative
But the majority came from Bricklink and eBay.
  Neutral
My advice is to get the figs in eBay auctions with clear pictures.
  Negative
Some of the 'used' figures I bought on Bricklink came with no faces.
  Negative
Some sellers are reliable with used figs, but only buy from those who use a clear rating system.
  Positive
A good thing to look for is the term "stiff joints" because the arms and legs really loosen up over time.

Of course I sell several of the figs MISB in my Bricklink store.

My Padawans, Yes, its time for another review (can you feel the excitment?)
  Positive
: the glorious Trade Federation MTT, the biggest SW set of that new instalment (120�).
  Positive
At first, when we all heard that TLC was going to redesign the MTT, I was kind of pissed since that the first version was pure crap !!
  Negative
Fortunatly, TLC made a fantastic set, definitly one of the best looking PT set (and definitly the best ep1/2 set !!)
  Positive
.
  Neutral
So without further ado...review on.
  Neutral
Enjoy !!
  Neutral
Before an in depth review of the set, lets have a look at both instruction manuals.
  Negative
The great news is the total absence of DSS yeayyyyy, that is so great !!
  Positive
1/MFs One of the best �deals� regarding MFs: a whopping 20 droids � 16 regular, 2 pilots and 2 security (+ 20 short guns and 2 long guns) and an amazing Droideka !!
  Positive
Nothing really new regarding the battle droids � except the new droid arm on every droid !!
  Positive
No need for too many pics on them so I�ll just show you the pilot and security + a close up of the new arm.
  Negative
Its really nice to notice that the whole body is blue (pilots) and dark red (security).
  Positive
It looks way better than small printings on a tan body.
  Negative
That droideka is really a thing of beauty !!
  Positive
The design is so much better, its incredible, I mean just check the comparison pic.
  Negative
The old one looks so puny.
  Neutral
The size is way better, the design is way slicker and it comprises great parts and colours.
  Positive
2/Overal pics of the beast Compared to the crappy first version, this MTT is way rounder, slicker and bigger (sorry, I cannot post comparison pics before I hated the old MTT and dismantled the set).
  Negative
Now we need a redesigned AAT to go with it hehe (come on TLC, bring it on !!)
  Neutral
.
  Neutral
The beast is on weels (strait and non turning) instead of those upside down smooth round tiles.
  Negative
The cool thing is all those opening doors do reveal details such as the cokpit (see �3) and all the extras (see %4).
  Negative
3/Details of the beast I shall start by the top of the MTT which reveals the cokpit and driver seat.
  Neutral
Easy access through the sliding top and opening of both sidre doors.
  Positive
As you can see there is not much of a cokpit (like always *cough cough* !!)
  Negative
Don�t rant yet Sne :-P !!
  Negative
Only a seat, two switches and 2 printed tiles.
  Negative
Now lets go on the side greebles !!
  Neutral
These are not very detailed but the model is not intended for UCS detailed greebles.
  Negative
As you can notice, both sides are different since there is the mechanism that makes the Droid Carriage come out (see %4).
  Negative
The front guns really look way better and the front is multi directional.
  Positive
The rear door is really neat due to the amount of greebles !!
  Positive
4/The beast is not alone: the great extras *Hovercraft* The rear door reveals the hovercraft.
  Negative
That thing is really not that great looking but its a nice addition to the set (also it justifies the use of two droid pilots !!)
  Positive
.
  Neutral
It comprises two parts: the actual vehicle and the top.
  Positive
I need to emphasize the fact that the top part can be changed !!
  Neutral
You can put the gun rack or one of the droid floors.
  Negative
Weird that this feature was not even on the box art or instruction manual.
  Negative
Oh well, thats why *yoda* is here X-D :-P lololol.
  Positive
*Droid Carriage* That is really a neat addition that gives the meaning to the term playability (Play On !!)
  Negative
.
  Neutral
The carriage (or whatever its called hehe) is made by 3 parts: the main structure and the two floors that hold 8 droids each.
  Negative
You turn the side knob to have that Carriage come out (don�t forget to open both front doors d�oh loool :-D ) *Gun Rack* Another neat addition.
  Negative
That rack can hold 16 short guns (for the amount of regular tan battle droids that fit in the droid carriage.
  Negative
You reach that rack by the side big openings.
  Neutral
Thats all folks and until the next SW set to review tada !!
  Neutral
Like always do not hesitate to ask questions, pics and share your comments !!
  Negative
SW On !!
  Neutral
*yoda*
Nice review i would get the set but first of all the price is to big & second im a clone fan but i must admit im tempted >:-)
Nice review!
  Negative
Thanks, *yoda* *y* So a non-StarWars fan is one of the first to comment on this >:-) : Great MTT.
  Negative
It has a lot of features that make a good playability.
  Positive
I especially like the hovercraft and the gun rack.
  Negative
And 20 droids!
  Positive
8-� What is TLG going to equal the dark side?
  Positive
I hope no 20 Gungans-set.
  Neutral
;-) I�d say 120 � is a fair price and a definite "must-buy" for every SW-fan.
  Positive
:'-) But that�s not me.
  Negative
:-P Another 120� saved for the 10190 and other stuff.
  Negative
Trade Federation on!
  Negative
This is one of the best reviews I have ever seen!
  Positive
Man, this set is good.
  Positive
The beast looks good, but then there are all these droids, weapons, ... TLC is learning what the fans want and they start providing it!
  Negative
Wheehoow !
  Positive
X-O This set is amazing...I already knew I was gonna buy it, but now I can�t actually wait till it�s in store :'-) One big vehicle, a smaller one with multiple possibilities and 20 droids... just perfect :'-) *y*
I didn't even know the set was out...Waaaait, how did you get it?
  Negative
they didn't list it in the lego catalog...
Wow thats one fine set you got there mate :-) Its nice to finally get a vehicle that belongs to the Separatists, as much as i love all the republic vehicles it was starting to feel very one sided.
  Positive
This sure looks like a beauty thats for sure *wub* i like the way tlc have made the cockpit very accessable with the roof and side entrance, its much better than the previous version....but thats aint hard X-D Though the cockpit does scream 'Please moc me' :-D Hey *yoda* whats the piece at the bottom of the destroyer droid thats conected to the legs?
  Negative
For the life of me i dont recognise it.
  Neutral
damn it !
  Positive
I want it now !!!!!!
  Neutral
thank you Yoda, once again :D
Hey Yoda... you said you have to remember to open the front door when turning the knob to extend the droid rack... to me it looks like there is a tow ball on the door and a curved top on the rack.
  Negative
I would guess that will guide the door open as the rack pushes against it.
  Negative
I think you need to try that out and see if that was actually what Lego intended!

*yoda* well actually yoda, compared to other sw sets like the ARC fighter, this set is extremely extravagant with its cockpit interior... X-D but, just to honour my rep, i'll say the cockpit interior is now so detailed that this poor pilot will never ever be able to understand all these switches, buttons and levers... again, what a lousy job, Lego!
  Negative
>:-( X-D happy *yoda*?
  Positive
X-D apart from that, nice set... for sw fans
A very beautiful sets with lots of goodies, great!
  Very positive
*y* It�s a very little shame that the deployment rack only works partially.
  Negative
If I remember correctly these droid shelves should be able to swivel around....
  Positive
Well, MOD on!

When are these new sets out in the UK dude?
  Positive
Wow... thats an excellent review there.
  Positive
Can't wait for this to be officially release here in Singapore... :)
Great review and thanks for all the photos!

Looks like an amazing set with lots of great features.

With all the minifigs, it looks to be well worth the money.

good review as always yoda!
  Positive
cant wait for a new city review from you
*Sigh* I want this now, too (yes, I know that sounds cliche).
  Negative
It definately looks way better than the original, and the droid rack is a nice addition.
  Positive
Does the rack push the door open as it moves, or do the doors have to be opened separately?
  Negative
Anyhow, this looks fantastic.
  Positive
I may get this, but probably not for a while (mainly because of the price).
  Negative
Wonderful review, I'm so jealous :'-( This is definitely one of the best sets put out by Lego!
  Very positive
I love the return of those ball turrets *wub* Could you maybe tell us how the door opening mechanism works?
  Neutral
You turn a knob, and gears push the droid carriage through the door, or do the doors open on their own?
  Negative
I think the carriage pushes them open due to the slops on top, but I can't be sure
Yet another nice review *yoda* *y*!
  Negative
I�m so going to get me one or two of these babies.
  Negative
The brown gunturrets in front are great!

  Negative
It looks to me like there is a towball on the underside of the door as well as the curved top.
  Negative
My guess would be the towball gets pushed as the mechanism comes out and opens the door and lifts it over the droid rack.
  Negative
Great Review *yoda* Excellent set there Probably one of the best I have seen in years Love the new droids, Finally they actually have ''REAl'' Blasters to hold ;-) Can't wait to get one or two, maybe three The new droideka looks really nice The comparison photo really shows how much better it is than the old one Quote (you wouldn't happen to have the Hoth set?

This quite small set is a great addition to the �harbour� sub theme (at least its how I view it).
  Positive
First here is a pic of the small instruction booklet and darn DSS !!
  Neutral
1/MF & Extras Its too bad that this set only comprises 1 MF, especially that this MF has nothing new (pretty boring actually).
  Negative
In fact, let me do a parallel with SW (yes, even in city mind you !!)
  Neutral
: oh yeay yet another Boba !!
  Neutral
I don�t have a huge collection of city sets, but I do have this fig in a lot of multiple (oh well...).
  Negative
The intersting extras are the Containers.
  Neutral
There are two different ones: a big classic red one (I do say classic because there is thre same in the Port set) that opens, and an open one which can hold the crate with red barrels + the two �italien� barrels (due to the coloring hehe).
  Negative
2/Vehicle This vehicle is quite weird looking with its 4 front wheels !!
  Negative
This makes it look like a mean machine.
  Positive
I guess its to support the mak of 10 tons it can carry !!
  Neutral
The telescoping arm is a) extensible and b) capable of moving up and down !!
  Positive
I am not a real fan of green but its good to have another color than the classic yellow *cough cough* Oh look, our Lego employee is looking at me (say �hi� to my friends at Eurobricks).
  Negative
Watch out dude, you are moving some inflatable stuff !!
  Positive
loool Oh boy, its fun to notice that Lego City has not implemented the forbidding of night labour :-D OK guys thats all for the review of this small set !!
  Positive
*yoda*
this looks pretty cool, however, i think the price was kinda high for just these elements, a car and a minifig.
  Positive
How much did you pay, yoda?
  Neutral
I agree Sne that this set is a bit overpriced compared to the other line !!
  Negative
I paid 25� |-/ As a comparison, the gas station is 35� and port is 80� !!
  Negative
Oh well, thats the problem of beeing a collector loool :-D *yoda*
25 euro for this?
  Positive
that means it will be 30 in Greece!

8-� that is way to much for this small set!

it does look nice.

Not that would be a major redesign anyway.

edit; snipped the pictures.

*Calls vader* HE doubel posted *points* ;-) Very nice set.
  Positive
Oh and Yoda where do you get these?
  Negative
I would kill to have a shop with new lego sets (The nearest shop with lego has the black sea barracuda as its newest set) near me... Or it Malta for that matter.
  Negative
No one brings SW sets here or the smaller ones.
  Neutral
Just the big expencive ones.
  Neutral
:-(
Nice!
  Positive
The vehicle is quite good looking.
  Positive
I like it.
  Neutral
Though, I don't need this set right now... -ZotS
I see Jurrasic Park Vehicle 8-�
25 Euro is quite high since it's listed for 17 on S@H... IMHO it's a decent successor to 4549 even if it comes without any cargo vehicle and just 1 MF.
  Very positive
But the front being 10-wide is ridiculously wide for a vehicle, even in the new scale.
  Negative
Getting rid of the two red Technic pins should help that, though, I think.
  Negative
4549's stacker was 8-wide in the front and was already wide for the "classic" scale, too, but 10 is a bit too much.
  Negative
Especially when you consider that Model Team was 10/12-wide :-| I like the lifting mechanism on this one better, though.
  Negative
For 17 Euro I might consider buying it if I can't get my hand on a 4549 ;-) Thanks for the review and the pics *sweet*

:'-( It's way better than the 7992, 10 wide is freaking wide.
  Negative
:-| http://guide.lugnet.com/set/4549 Who cannot like that set?!
  Negative
:'-)
Regarding the front wheels being way too wide.
  Negative
I think you've got the 'inside' pair of wheels on backwards, the red spacers are supposed to fit inside the wheel's indented side.
  Neutral
I'll also say, that while this is a Very Pretty set.
  Positive
It is Cumbersome to play with, the 'pneumatic cylinder' pieces look good, but have waaay too much friction, which means you have to disrupt swooshplay to pick it up and pull them into position.
  Negative
the front wheels are all on a single axle, which makes rolling it around curves a little difficult; you can easily replace the Long Axle with a pair of 5.5axleWithStoppers, to enable wheels on each side to rotate separatly and have a pin connector on the rear wheels.
  Negative
This should make 'vroom vroom' feel a lot nicer on curves.
  Neutral
I also think the connector hook on the cargo boxes is a bit hard to actually hook onto, a 2*2 plate with handlebar would be much easier, assuming 2studs holds on well enough.
  Negative
On the plus side, Green!
  Neutral
and 6 of the new wheels.
  Positive
Hello xwingyoda, Excellent review of the 7992.
  Positive
I couldn't wait for the store to stock them so I ordered three from ToysRUs Canada.
  Negative
Faster shipping than S@H.
  Neutral
$26.99 CDN which works out to 18.5200 EUR
if the cargo is too heavy... does that mean the little fellow will be sandwiched?
  Negative
^^ nice review btw thx ^^ Edited by Hobbes, 28 May 2007 - 04:12 PM.
  Negative
My padawans, let me present to you that glorious and beautifull Port !!
  Positive
�I am not worthy, I�m not worthy� (oh *yoda* , do shut up and review the glorious set !!)
  Positive
.
  Neutral
I really think that this set is the best �07 city sets (I was waiting so long for another port, meessa so happy !!)
  Positive
.
  Neutral
Really 2 thumbs up to TLC for this !!
  Neutral
I hope you�ll enjoy this looong review as much as I love that set.
  Positive
There are 3 instructions manuals and a HUGE DSS (darn you TLC !!)
  Negative
: Here is a general view of the whole set: I shall review that set according to the instructions booklets so lets go !!
  Negative
1/The truck There is nothing really to notice about that MF, another boring classic fig that we have lots off.
  Negative
On the other hand, the truck is really neat.
  Positive
It comprises the main body and a classic container (like the one shown in my review of 7992).
  Positive
Off course the truck can transport all the other containers (see �2).
  Negative
2/The ship *the extras* I tend to like those 2 figs: the technician and the lovely captain (who senses a �Love Boat� MOC :-D lolol).
  Negative
Than there are the 3 containers: a classic green, a simple one with 4 �italien� barrels.
  Positive
The truly great one is the small power boat Container.
  Positive
The small boat is quite simple but looks great !!
  Positive
Tks to the use of one of the best Lego parts ever: the 1x1 slope *the ship* Now the interesting stuff really starts !!
  Negative
Ok, its hard to take decent pics due to the bloody size of that ship (58 cms/22,8 in long !!)
  Negative
.
  Neutral
On a side note, I did not use the huge �City Lines� stickers on the hull (I might add them later, I�m not really sure).
  Negative
Like you imagined, the ship floats and has underneath the hull the spot to attach an electric motor (not included in the set).
  Negative
Now lets focus on the details of that ship: The front is quite simple � it has what a ship needs: an anker, lights and an opening to place whatever fits in hehe (on a side note, its weird to notice that there are NO life vests on that ship � not very precautious Lego !!)
  Positive
.
  Neutral
The mid section is only to hold all those crates !!
  Negative
The rear is much cooler !!
  Neutral
The �tower� can be divided in 3 parts: the lower part is where both engines are, then the cokpit is on the second level (see Sne, there is a better cokpit here than in SW sets lolol) and finally the chimney with radar, dopler and what have you !!
  Negative
3/ The harbour port I shall dismantle parts of the harbour for pics purposes !!
  Neutral
Otherwise its going to be quite hard to have nice pics !!
  Negative
Yeay, that thing is huge :-P *the front with fisherman* Nothing too special, guste a nice gesture from TLC adding a normal cityman !!
  Negative
I love the green uniform (I was bored of that blue one !!)
  Positive
.
  Neutral
As you can see, the front has 2 stuff to attache boats.
  Negative
Ok, I really wonder why a "civilian" is fishing in a restricted area !!
  Negative
Call security asap.
  Neutral
*the crane* That was quite a nice thing to build hehe !!
  Negative
Its nice to have a red crane.
  Positive
There are 2 knobs onb that baby: one that operates the hook and the second one that operates the hight of the arm (it makes that arm goes either up or down).
  Negative
I didn�t even care of taking a pic of the MF since its a boring worker !!
  Positive
*the office* That is my favorite part of the harbour !!
  Positive
It represents the heart of the port.
  Positive
First the vehicle needs to go through the opening gates.
  Neutral
I think that TLC thinks that people are morons since they added a traffic light in front of the gates !!
  Neutral
Drive when its open you moron :-| :-D !!
  Neutral
The office is small and cosy and has only the regular computer which operates the door and light !!
  Negative
As you can see, next to it, there are loads of usefull stuff for the employee to work and clean !!
  Negative
I shall finish that review with a hysterical add on by TLC: the watch out sign just above the life bouey lolololol So in case a moron is speeding in a harbour port, the employee can throw him the bouey if he is not on strike :-D Thats all folks for this set !!
  Negative
Until next time, tada... *yoda*
Great review *yoda* !
  Positive
Thanks for sharing.
  Neutral
I was wondering how you got your hands on these sets [this and 7992]?
  Negative
I can't wait to get them.
  Negative
Thanks again!
  Positive
this looks SO SO SO SO SO much nicer than i thought!!
  Neutral
i love the small truck i love the office and the crane!
  Positive
i really like the "tower" of the ship!
  Positive
one of the best they ever made!
  Positive
the only thing i dont like is the size of the ship.
  Negative
.
  Neutral
i find it useless since you can only fill it with cargo and more cargo.
  Negative
.
  Neutral
what is the point of that?
  Neutral
there is the front of the ship...there is the back of the ship...there is the boring huge empty hull in the middle!
  Negative
i find that pointless!
  Negative
the possitive is more than the negative!
  Negative
i realy like the captain figure and the green fisherman!
  Neutral
TLC has given us great stuff this year.
  Positive

  Neutral
this ship remains my lego cargo favorite.
  Positive

  Neutral

  Neutral
a lot of thanks to you yoda!
  Positive
you have given us so many great reviews the past few days!!
  Negative
and this was great!!
  Positive
*y* *y* well done my friend!!
  Negative
hinckley39, like I posted elswhere on EB, my "Lego" shop received nearly all the new sets (they had the garbage truck and gas station) and were waiting for the other city sets like the train station !!
  Negative
I shall pick this one up soon hehe >+ they had nearlly all the Mars Mission sets and the 3 smaller Castle sets< I might buy a second port later on to expend it hehe !!
  Negative
Actually I hope TLC opened Pandora's box with those harbour sets !!
  Neutral
*yoda*
What a nice review of a really lovely set!
  Positive
I�m so glad that I can now add such a neat harbor to my ongoing city project....
  Positive
Hmm, I guess I have to raise the city to provide it from becoming overflooded by the sea.... 8-| The ship is so beautiful!
  Positive
Only that chimney should better be placed three studs more to the back, it�s a little too close to the bridge, but maybe it�s supposed to work as an indirect heating device.
  Negative
:-D That warning sign is hilarious!
  Positive
A great and overall very satisfiable set!
  Positive
*y* Merchant Navy on!

*sweet*
Thank you for this wonderful review, Yoda!
  Positive
This set is an absoulute must for a city fan, the best city set in years, probaly for a decade.
  Positive
I'm a little disapointed with the office, it's much smaller than I expected, but besides that everything looks so cool!
  Negative
Especially the Captain with the white shirt!
  Positive
8-� That is a new torso, right?
  Positive
I do think the trafficlight is realistic, and I'm so happy they included such a funny sign, and it's realistic!
  Very positive
http://blogs.warwick...pg?maxWidth=500 :-D And a question, if you please, what's the bottom of the ship like?
  Negative
Thanks for the review!
  Positive
This set looks pretty nice ... but it continues a trend that's been bugging me for a while.
  Positive
To borrow a phrase from the Simpsons, Lego is "enbiggening" everything.
  Negative
My town is built on the classic scale of 4-stud wide cars, 8-stud wide ships, etc.
  Positive
Now Lego is making 6- and 8-stud wide trucks.
  Neutral
The cargo containers are 6-wide instead of the old 4-wide.
  Neutral
The new airplanes are 8-stud wide instead of the old 4-stud wide.
  Positive
And then there's this colossal monstrosity of a cargo ship.
  Negative
That beast would overpower my entire city!
  Neutral
I know it seems like a weird thing to complain about, that Lego is making everything too BIG.
  Negative
Of course the joy of Lego is that I can always downscale everything to match my existing stuff.
  Positive
I'm also a little bummed that Lego isn't using the classic harbor plates and ramps.
  Negative
Man, I love those pieces.
  Neutral
Can you give us a picture of just the new harbor plate?
  Neutral
It looks like a new piece to me, or at least it's a piece that I'm not familiar with.
  Negative
In general, I love, love, love the City stuff coming out this year.
  Positive
For many years, City was the red-headed step-child of Lego, and it's nice to see it coming back to prominence where it belongs.
  Negative
-Joebot
great review Yoda!

I really like this set with the comical sign, the van, obviously the boat and the captain is really cool aswell!

-Joebot The roadplates are simply the same as in the old road construction set with the brigde.

But here they just use the straight ones.

In the corner where the office is located, it's used the plates from the old street hockey set, though in a different colour scene.

Thanks again, *yoda* for this great review.
  Positive
*y* Wow, I really like this set.
  Positive
It�s not only for the ship but for all these small details.
  Negative
A fisherman, the hilarious road sign, the engine room, the neat office, the small barrier with the lights (well, one red light would have done) and the great new torsos!
  Very positive
*wub* What I don�t like is the design of the crane.
  Negative
Too many bigger parts, some even without any studs!?
  Negative
:-X TLG could have done better with this!
  Negative
The only bad thing about this set is: I already own the 4030 - there is no use for another freight ship.
  Negative
If I wouldn�t have it, I�d be off to buy it asap, because this one would fit my other ships (4020, 4021, 4022) way better.
  Negative
At this point I disagree to phoinix.
  Neutral
The police boat has to be a lot smaller than a freight ship.
  Neutral
Here you go!
  Neutral
And with one more terrific set I continue to wonder who will have the money to buy all this?
  Positive
:-| C�mon TLG, spare some great sets for the next years!
  Positive
;-)
Very very nice.
  Positive
I really want this set, even though at the moment it would have no place in my town.
  Negative
I love the boat, the crane is really cool, and the pier is just awesome.
  Positive
Add the 10 tonne loader onto this set and it's perfect.

I wonder if thats a new windscreen on the bridge (the downsloping windows), they look useful... and now I'm feeling like making a few of those mini speedboats, or that office building, so simple but nice to have around...
This is an amazingly impressive set!
  Positive
Thanks for the review :-) I have to say my favorite feature is...the fact that the truck has "side-view mirrors" :-D It just makes it look sooooo much better!
  Negative
Everything is great though!

  Negative
*y* *y* *y* :-)
Thanks Yoda for sharing this set with us too!
  Negative
This set is really nice!
  Positive
I'm like Holodoc, the think I like is not a special parts, but all the small details that you have here and here, like the road sign, a bin, some accesories,... The truck has the same effect on me like the blue one in the RC cargo train.
  Negative
I know that I will be able to buy this set just for it :-D !
  Positive
But all the set is good, so no matter!
  Positive
Maybe in fact the boat is too long, with just few containers.
  Neutral
But maybee we will have additional sets will new containers like the green trcuk.
  Positive
Just hope... Iwill have good dreams this night X-D
Looks good.
  Positive
Though I'm not sure about the boats yet.
  Negative
I would have preferred the old ones.
  Negative
Do you have any pictures of the ship pieces by themselves?
  Negative
I wonder why Lego didn't include life vests (they would have fit perfectly in that little hatch at the bow).

Are the green overalls new to this set?

We were all quite excited when M:tron was released in 1990.
  Negative
Red parts in space was a first *sweet* , but it looked cool, even though most of us were hoping for extra set from Space Police or Blacktron.
  Negative
.
  Neutral
The Particle Ioniser was this year�s middle class space ship.
  Negative
Unfortunately, it didn�t come close Space Police�s �Prisoner transport� of the year before.
  Negative
:-X An over all look shows that it�s not your typical fighter plane.
  Negative
It�s more like a multifunctional space craft, with a bit of everything, assuring a high playability factor.
  Negative
.
  Neutral
The cockpit is more or less standard: only the large trans-neon green canopy is interesting.
  Positive
I guess they opted for a white printed tile to contrast with the over all red-black coloured style of M:tron.
  Negative
I do like the head-on shot, though.
  Positive
It shows that the ship is not so much a �ship�, but a space helicopter, instead of rotor blades, there are large antennas.
  Negative
I know, it�s a bit too easy, but I guess it was a nice change to what we usually got.
  Positive
Notice that the rotor engine hangs a bit forward, as a real rotor of a helicopter very often does.
  Negative
I like that� Looks cool� Behind the cockpit there�s an extra room for the robot.
  Positive
We�re still very, very, very far away from SW droids, so we were quite happy with the technic arms and the levers, still, space urgently needs a subtheme with decent androids, not the alien crap we get today or this nifty fella.
  Negative
.
  Neutral
the red wing and the large printed parts function as door to open and close the robot�s private room� Then there�s this boom at the back of the ship that swings the cargo on and off board.
  Negative
Not all that detailed� it makes you wonder though, when you compare this design with that new green transport container in �city�, how a space ship would look today, if it only followed �city� standards of quality� The cargo fits in at the back, but not all that good, I�m afraid.
  Negative
The two black wings on the side prevent it from touching the red tiled ground, making the cargo fairly unstable.
  Negative
Let�s face it, M:tron and this set are not exactly the highfliers of �Space�.
  Negative
Their main contribution to space was the introduction of a new concept for space: transportation of cargo.
  Negative
Add some thieves like �Blacktron� and a couple of Police fighters and voil�, you�ve got yourself a story� Nevertheless, the ship itself looks better in real than in the catalogues.
  Negative
It�s not as bulky as in the photos, it�s actually slim built, and the red parts surely made it compatible with �Town�.
  Very negative
But that�s about it� Bricklink Brickshelf Lugnet
Nice review.
  Negative
This is my favourite M:tron ship.
  Negative
I always saw this thing as a sort of fire truck, putting out plasma fires with the nozzle on the front.
  Negative
I never had any trouble with the cargo pod, it just needed to be pushed down to get between the fins.
  Negative
Maybe the problem arose with this release, it has a different boom construction than the first.
  Negative
Although, I have both versions and I don't recall any difficulties with it.
  Negative
Also the rotor assembly was changed in this one.
  Neutral
It still works, but I always liked the first type better.
  Positive
I need to upload the first version's instructions somewhere.
  Neutral
I can only find the second one online.
  Negative
One more thing to put on my "to do" list....
  Neutral
A very interesting set with a good color scheme and some cool and playable features!
  Positive
Neat.
  Neutral
The design is elegant and aggressive and that small robot is lovely.

in any case, i did have a 1x2 black connector brick left, maybe that was part of the originel set?

1/The Mfs and accessories *MFs* Out of the 5 Mfs, 3 are workers (train employee with train logo on torso) and 2 are civilians (a guy in a suit and a cool dude with the classic space logo jacket (I love that torso really !!)

The interesting thing is the nice smiley faces - a nice new way of having smileys that change a tiny bit.
  Positive
*Train Cart* That cart is way better than the one in the advent calendar set.
  Negative
The colours are better and its really better designed.
  Positive
Lets look at this carty and comparison pics after: *Smaller extras* One pic to show them all !!
  Neutral
I didn't know the bar had 2 bottles and a croissant (yeay !!)
  Negative

2/Overal views of the station I really like this train station a lot more than the previous one.
  Negative
I really love the classic feel to it: its a nice small town station without the modernity looks of a megalopole !!
  Positive
Can this means that next year we will have a new older looking passenger train ?
  Negative
I seriously would hope so !!
  Neutral
The station is actually 2 parts combined: the train platform and the station building.
  Negative
3/Details of the station (aka the *yoda* twitch :-P ) Lego included really neat extras in that set !!
  Positive
I will start in the order by which *yoda* (me and SW lolol) needs to go in order to catch his train (when those lousy workers are not in strike that is).
  Negative
Our green creature from the swamps need to get his ticket first.
  Negative
There is the only modernity of that set: electronic ticketing (no counters = efficient work and no strikes looool when it actually works that is :-D ).
  Negative
Then he has to go through the controls to reach the platform.
  Neutral
Everything is in order *yoda* , please proceed !!
  Negative
*yoda* has two waiting rooms for his wait, one even has a suitcase holder !!
  Negative
*yoda* can check the train routes (that should be included near the ticketing booth but what the heck !!)
  Negative
.
  Neutral
Paris train leaves at 11.34 hehe So Yoda can take it to visit the Eiffel Tower *yoda* can have the pleasure to go and eat in the small area where there is no employee unfortunatly !!
  Negative
Anyhow he used the force to get a drink lolol With his drink in hand (he already ate the only croissant tsts, there is no such French delights on Dagobah :-P ), he can go to the roof of the station where a table awaits him He can finally open the window and view the empty tracks hehe.
  Negative
No train in sight... His shadow kind of looks creepy... Strikes and lack of employment discipline can ruin even the patience of the oldest jedi !!
  Negative
Our *yoda* decided to steal (not very jedi wise |-/ ) the train cart and is using the force to operate it (lets not forget he is 900 years old, heavy physical exercise is definitly out of the question :-D ) At this pace he will reach Paris in no time (lolol).
  Negative
Next time, do use your escape pod: I think he is too old to remember where he left it after the Kashyyyk retreat lolol I hope you enjoyed this review and until next time, I bid you farwell... *yoda*
Another nice review Yoda *y*!
  Negative
Seems I have to go one more step to the Dark City side of the force and get this baby!

It looks really nice!

He did, what did you expect :-P ?

After all that looooog retreat on his swamp he neede to have a little sun on the roof to get a tan (or in his case a dark green :-D ).
  Negative
Somehow I deleted the right pic :-D Oh well, I will add that one tomorrow !!
  Positive
*yoda*
Wow!
  Positive
I am definetely going to buy this set any time soon!
  Positive
I never thought there were going to be any windows in the structure, but those large ones from the Basketballsets look great.
  Positive
Lovely ticketbox, the swivel entry fence looks kind of pointless though, but that one can be removed easily.
  Negative
The bar is quite nice with those two see-through closets (fridge?)
  Positive
and cashregister.

Just one thing: Why isn't Amsterdam on the departurelist, it was on most of the other stations lists....?
  Negative

GO Yoda go!
  Neutral
*yoda* *y* Thank you for your review and the brilliant idea of including yourself into your short story here!
  Positive
Man, I thought I wanted to skip all these sets, but now... It's like the harbour set: I'm not enthusiastic about the building/ship, but the small details make it very interesting.
  Positive
Maybe I'll have to change my opinion on this set.
  Neutral
I don't (yet) have passenger trains, though because I don't like the newer ones 7897 and 4511.

Great review Yoda - funny and informative (although a sad commentary on the state of the trains in France, I guess).
  Positive
Lots of useful generic building parts - I figure with 4 of these a resectable train station can be made.
  Negative
Those 1x5x5 trans clear bricks are amazing!
  Positive
I paid a buck each for them on bricklink a year ago.
  Neutral
They are totally useful parts in anything you build (I was never able to really clean the print off the basketball ones).
  Negative
Lots of little goodies.
  Positive
I predict lots of bits of this set will end up in many different CC-Market street extensions.
  Negative
Nothing useless in this set.
  Negative
Depending on the price point, this coudl be an incredible set.
  Positive
So far I like it best of all the new 2007 sets that I have not bought yet (CC of course is #1)
This is a very nice station building!
  Positive
I didn't know they made windows that size though... This seems like a return to bricks rather than the last station they put out with all the curved windows and walls and such.
  Negative
I love the little details in this set such as the new parcel sticker, the drinks dispensers at the shop, the refrigerators, etc.
  Negative
As someone else said not entirely sure about the turnstile though, seems a bit pointless.
  Negative
I will have to buy this though.
  Neutral
What is LEGO trying to do, bankrupt me?!
  Neutral
What with Market Street, the gas station, the port, the garbage and cement trucks, and now this... Now then, can we have that review of the gas station?

This is the one I've been waiting on!

  Positive
cheers
Thanks for the nice review, *yoda* !
  Negative
I was already planning on getting this baby.
  Negative
But this review has sealed the deal even more!
  Negative
The only thing that irks me is the inclusion of the rc track, no need for that.
  Negative
A female should have been included, what's up with this homo-erotic attitude of lego these days?
  Negative
Wasn't the release date september ?
  Negative
Thanks another time for thos review!
  Positive
I was on your BS gallery this afternoon at work (pas bien!)
  Negative
and I see this not yet public folder.
  Positive
So I tried to find the good number of one pic to see it (with the direct link), but without success... So I waited some minutes and read this review... This station looks really good, with all those details!
  Very positive
I've got the 4513 station but this one looks better and better, with a "je ne sais quoi", a charming touch... And all those details!
  Positive
(I know I've already say it!)

The ticket machine is simply great!
  Positive
And the cafe section too, like the chairs and the part to put our luggage!

And we have new faces yes, but they look rlike we have already seen their.
  Negative
And they are all brown.
  Neutral
It's like it's the same head with different expression :-P And for trains in France, I don't understand why is the interest of having the speed record on rails if common trains on the day-life are always late... :-| But I've got some friends who said me that it's worse outside (like in Hungary and Portugal)
Very well done *yoda* .
  Negative
Your review was excellent.
  Positive
I wasn't really sure about this station, but with your review and the photos, I am definitly thinking about buying this one.
  Negative
I really liked the windows and the columns.
  Positive
I thought it was really cool to see TLC make columns in yellow.
  Positive
This is definitly a very neat set.
  Positive
Thank you for the review *yoda* .
  Negative
Model on!
  Neutral
I wasnt sure if i was going to get the station but im convinced now!
  Negative
nice review *y* *wub*
I may actually buy this one after all.
  Negative
Don't know what I'll do with the plastic rails though.
  Negative
I'll probably use them to display locomotives on my shelf, and save the 9v track for actual play value.
  Negative
--Tony
a great set at a good price!
  Positive
thanks yoda you have been making my days lately (well you and eurovision) it looks very nice and i know you hate stickers and so do i but these are very good ones!
  Positive
and new ones!
  Positive
a must have for me since i have never bought a station before but 4554 is still the best one this isnt really a station is more like a platform that you find in a lot of villages here in Greece and it does have a town feeling to it (which for me its great) lots of cool accesories and nice figs but why isnt there a girl??

(again) this is in my list with the fuel station and the garbage truck!!

  Positive
But actually it s the clever building style of that set which impressed me the most.
  Positive
With only two of these I''m easily able to build a good looking customized station while I'm still able to use the second platform for a nice additional station along my tracks.
  Positive
Smart, and the price is also good.

Great Review, as always It does have a very classic feel to it Love the kitchen/resturant area The fridge and soda fountain are nice touches :'-) More Lego food Finally TLG realizes that lego minis eat more then just pizza :-D After a couple of times they do get old A must buy :-) Are those all the New town sets you have so far?
  Negative
Piranha Quote Wait till the Mars Mission reviews tomorrow :-P Does this mean that they could be not as bad as everyone thinks?
  Negative
I am curious to know what little town in the middle of Europe (my guess is that it would be in Der Schweiz-Switzerland) has a very small train station which allows a person to convenaitly board a train to any of the listed locations.
  Negative
I mean come on TGV, ICE, EUROSTAR EXPRESS, Whatever AVE runs, you name it.
  Negative
How many TGV trains stop at little stations?

I thought it was just major city main stations.

And I do agree with you guys, there is a serious lack of females in those sets (I'm not asking for females truck drivers and what have you) but civilians or cshiers (...) |-/ Oh well, yippy, Exo Force has a female now, that makes my day :-| *yoda*

I am very pleased by this set (12€) – it really looks great and has a neat colour pattern (more on that later).
  Negative
Like always here are pics of the book and DSS (G, this theme has loads of darn stickers – as you can see, I didn’t use 100% of the stickers – I didn’t use the cokpit one).
  Negative
For once I shall comment a bit on the box art.
  Negative
Look at that neat MM Logo, doesn’t it ring a brell to CS fans ?
  Negative
1/The Mfs I am SO pissed off at TLC for producing those UGLY and CRAP aliens.
  Negative
G what were they thinking.
  Neutral
At least the old Life On Mars sets had fun looking aliens that ressembled some comics one, here it just plain ugly.
  Negative
Viewing it from a certain distance and lying on the capsule thingy it looks more or less OK.
  Negative
However,when you zoom in, you just get sick by this ugly jelly.
  Neutral
Yuk !!
  Neutral
The Mf comprises 2 parts: legs and the rest (torso + non moving arms + head).
  Negative
I will stop on that before beeing too rude... At least the human MF makes up for it: he is really nice and I love that gilden visor.
  Positive
The torso is printed ob both sides with great designs.
  Positive
It great to see that the head is a baklava, nice.
  Positive
2/ The Trike I love the design of that beast and the colour scheme is just perfect.
  Positive
Its exactly the colour scheme that I am using for the Team Odysseus project and I do have a feeling that there are no coincidences !!
  Negative
Face it, how many space MOCs do you have in White/Orange ??
  Neutral
Not that many for sure.
  Neutral
I like the general design with the huge orange wheels.
  Negative
I like also that the rear whell is attach on both sides and not to one like the older trike.
  Negative
Look some comparison pics: the new trike is meaner and bigger, yeay !!
  Neutral
Its normal since it has a rear alien prison or vacum as I love to call it.
  Neutral
Yeay I know I'm missing the cokpit on that old trike (I just couldn't find it this morning :-| :-P ) The cokpit looks great in orange !!
  Negative
Design wise its on a moving platform which makes it sleeker.
  Positive
Behind there are two guns and a green diamond hehe.
  Negative
As I said, there is the vacum on the rear.
  Negative
I have a problem with that thing: once the alien capsule is in, it moves like hell in there.
  Negative
So kim if you swoosh it, the capsule is history !!
  Negative
I left the sticker on that one because I think its funny.
  Negative
I shall finish with the huge wheels !!
  Positive
You should definitly buy that mean machine !!
  Neutral
Aliens beware, you shall be harvested in no time !!

Eradication On !!

*yoda*
Thanks for this review !
  Negative
It's always nice to see a space review.
  Positive
As expected the aliens are crap, so I'm not commenting on this.
  Negative
I must say the set seems to follow the rule "Bigger but emptier".
  Negative
This is especially true in comparison of the older trike set.
  Positive
The trans orange theme is kinda cool.
  Positive
Too bad that they are no oxygen tanks on the back of the minifig *n*.
  Negative
I have some questions : - Where did you find this set this early (I think they are due during the August month ?)
  Negative
8-� - Since the wheels are so far apart from the body and only attached by technic axles, is the set not too fragile ?

Perhaps these are some sort of deformed drone soldier and the real aliens will be released at a later date, hint hint ;-) ;-)
Heh,the alien is being impaled in a capsule.

  Negative
Sure it looks good, but I much prefer some of the other sets from this line.
  Positive
But it's on the maybe list anyway.
  Neutral
Thanks for the pics I suppose the organge 'vaccuume' thing might be useful as ... maybe a 'warp core' in a MOC.
  Positive
I'm annoyed that they re-created the Trike, but did not also have a MonoJet set.
  Negative
This basically forces you to buy Two of the new trike to get an Even number of orange wheels.

Yeah, its a conspiracy I say.

I will not buy any of those MM sets (I�m not a space fan, it�s like EF for me, just a look and that all, contrary to SW which I could buy some of them if I�ll be rich).

The colour scheme is good, and the golden visor too.

Those alien are really :-X , they don't look like LEGO (more like a kinder toy) and they don't look terrifying!
  Negative
I mean, if they have been more alarming, I will understand that spacemen want to catch them.
  Negative
But here, it seems that men just have to "gather" them.
  Negative
Those aliens can't run, just jump (because of their connected legs) and nothing more!
  Negative
I think that TLC would have done some better aliens, with a more LEGO feeling and another look.
  Negative
For example, an alienfig with a posture like a twilight monster from the last Zelda TP would have been better IMO... Not a space fan, but I want that TLC makes some good space sets!

I don't get your question.
  Negative
I will post tomorrow a pic where I will press on the trike to show you that the suspension is not that stiff at all ;-) *yoda*
Well, how can you have a suspension without rubber bands or technic shock abosorbers?
  Negative
Are they just relying on bending the plastic?
  Neutral
Great review again *yoda* .
  Positive
Even though I am a "Town/Train" collector, as a Lego fan I would agree that the alien figure does not seem like Lego.
  Negative
I also like how TLC took the CS logo and incorporated it in this theme.

This definitly brings you back to the "old days" of Lego.

Again great review.

Great review.........(ya you know) The aliens aren't half bad Early production pics show that they had movable arms but I guess they changed them to one piece They do have a Jello like appearence maybe they are 95% water and 5% Jello :-D my only complaint is they have no way to fight back,sure they have better technology but they end up getting impaled and being examined by humans *alien* Piranha
Before getting in the specifics of your question xenologer, look at this pic: It clearly shows that there is space for those wheels to move.
  Negative
xenologer, on May 18 2007, 09:15 PM, said: Well, how can you have a suspension without rubber bands or technic shock abosorbers?

Actually regarding the two front wheels, there is a little rubber piece, that prevents the torsion of the technic part: xenologer, on May 18 2007, 09:15 PM, said: Are they just relying on bending the plastic?
  Negative
That is correct with the rear wheel ;-) You can easilly see from the pic that the technic part is bent a bit, but its not problematic (on the pic I really pushed all the way which doesn't happen whan you swoosh it :-D ) Hope that answered your questions ;-) *yoda*

Number: 30270 Name: Kraang's Laser Turret (AKA Kraang's Turtle Target Practice Theme: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Year: 2013 Minifigs: One Pieces: 36 ( I count 45) Price: $3.99 Parts: The parts themselves are okay.
  Negative
I personally would prefer the octagonal ring and arms to be in grey instead of flat silver.
  Negative
I feel that they would be more usefull, and I don't care for using both light grey and flat silver in the same metalic contraption.
  Negative
I also don't care for the magenta and pink, but it's probably important to differentiate it from the turtles colors.
  Negative
For all I know this is what Kraang's blasts look like in the new cartoon.
  Negative
Holy moley!
  Positive
Look at all those extra parts!
  Neutral
And one of them is a round tile!
  Neutral
People: Oops, I forgot to take a picture of Kraang, so here is the Brickset pic of him.
  Negative
Gah!
  Neutral
with so much pink and blue, he looks like a friends creation.
  Negative
Ok, the pink color is unavoidable, but the blue...as near as I can tell the exosuit is metalic or grey, but is often lit by a blue light, so this is what we get.
  Negative
In 2014 this design will be grey, but the blue color makes this a pretty useless minifig.
  Negative
Design: Pretty straightforward.
  Positive
I like getting polybags without wheels, because I get more useable parts.
  Negative
The design is playability genius.
  Positive
This is actually a use of flick fire missiles I approve of.
  Positive
MVP: Most valuable Piece It's the 2x2 round brick with grille!
  Positive
I know this isn't exactly a rare part, but lets be clear.
  Negative
This is one of the least expensive ways of getting it.
  Positive
The other parts are great as well, but just the thought of making columns of these in light bley was enough for me.
  Positive
Of course now that I've said that they are going to start appearing on PAB walls.
  Neutral
Conclusion: Parts: 9/10 Minifigs: 2/10 Build: 8/10 Playability: 10/10 Price: 9/10 Overall 7.6/10
I like the Kraang exoskeleton/android body.
  Negative
I think the colors work just fine.
  Neutral
I'm a big Krang fan though, so I could be biased.
  Negative
And yeah, shooting the little turtle targets is actually super fun.
  Negative
It's the only time I've ever really enjoyed a flick missile.
  Positive
That is far from being a useless minifig...imo.
  Negative
I have two of these sets one I am leaving sealed in the bag.
  Negative
INDEXED *yoda* strikes again with another review (what am I going to do when there will be no more sets to review loool) � the city gas station.
  Negative
Like the Train station, I think that this set has a small town feel which I think is great.
  Positive
This set has 2 instruction manuals & 2 DSS (I think its a mistake since we only need 1) 1/Mfs and Vehicles I think that 3 Mfs is quite disappointing in a 35� set: 2 civilians (one with the space jacket again hehe) and a classic Octan worker blue jumpsuit.
  Negative
The yellow car is nothing spectacular � just a neat little car.
  Positive
The only thing that needs to be pointed out is that there is an extra plate on the rear weels (to have the rear 1 plate higher than the front � to give it a little hot rod feel).
  Negative
Its great to have a black bike.
  Positive
I already have 1, so I put the racing stickers on it.
  Positive
2/Gas Station Its really a neat station with a lot of sweet details !!
  Positive
Its funny to remark that the actual set�s instructions differ from the booklet art (I let you look at the changes hehe).
  Positive
I shall start with general views of that station.
  Neutral
Now lets focus on details.
  Neutral
*car wash* Thats my favorite detail of this set.
  Positive
The 2 brushes are hold together with an elastic band which help them to �close� on the vehicle.
  Neutral
There is a nice light to tell you when the was is over hehe.
  Positive
The two rotors that serve as heaters can move with the handle.
  Positive
I will finish with the roof that comprises the two nice stickers and opening �windows�.
  Positive
*shop* Yeay, another shop !!
  Negative
The great feture is on its left, there is a distributing machine (that holds 5 trans dark cones !!)
  Positive
.
  Neutral
The shop is neat from the exterior with its 4 lights, 2 windows and a door + bottles stands in front of it !!
  Positive
*gas pumps* The system to operate those pumps is quite weird: you need to turn the gas handle on the right, then go and put the nozzle in the car and let have that black gold flowing !!
  Negative
And if you mess up, there is a place for cleaning hehe.
  Negative
The roof is quite nice with the Octan colours and the huge Octan Logo tht turns.
  Positive
There are 4 glasses to let the light throw and 2 lights for the evening craves lool.
  Negative
Finally, there is the sides: flowers, barriers and the price list.
  Neutral
Lets keep that gas pumping for our Mfs supped up vehicles hehe !!
  Neutral
So until next review, I say Cheers Mates !!
  Neutral
*yoda*
Why am I not a town collector???
  Negative
This set is soooo good.
  Positive
My favorite part is the transparent price list.
  Negative
You must have a huge collection Mr. Yoda.
  Neutral
Not only you collect SW, but also all these nice city sets.
  Negative
Are you using them to build a town?
  Neutral
Wow, what a neat set!
  Positive
*y* Excellent pictures, *yoda*!
  Negative
The proportions of that station�re very nice and there�re also very satisfyingly details like that softdrink automat and those motoroil bottles.
  Negative
Yeah, my first LEGO gas station!

Maybe in twenty years they�re gone.... :-P

Nice station, even if I prefer the fisrt Octan station 6397...
Another great review *yoda* .
  Positive
I would have to say if you keep reviewing these "City" sets I too will go broke :-) .
  Negative
I really liked the details that TLC added to this station.
  Positive
I will definitly have to think about this set.
  Neutral
The one thing that puzzled me was the size of the main store.
  Negative
I think it would have been cool if TLC made the store the same length as the car wash.
  Negative
This way there could be merchandise in there too.
  Neutral
Oh, maybe something I will add if I buy this.
  Positive
Thank you again for the review, Model On.

Very nice to see Lego going back to the old tradition of make Gas Stations... I remember the old ones, thanks for the review, maybe i get but im not sure.

I've been waiting for this review for a looong time, now I just want it more badly!

Nice review Yoda, *y* :-) I like the station, but I also think the first version of the octan station is better ( nicer roof, more shop)
Another great review Yoda I will again probably get this set thanks to you!
  Positive
;-) I really like the yellow car, very classy and the car wash (it is similar to a petrol station I used to have, which was probably better than this set).
  Positive
I think they could have done a little more with the shop and maybe,instead of a bike, have a break-down truck!
  Negative
nice review all the same!

Great review!

I only wish that it came with a tow truck like the older gas stations did.

It's a good marketing strategie to make sets with things that are missing, so TLC can do new sets the year after, including those elements, so you will buy them to complete your collection... Like it did in a past not so far away...

*yoda* well it's clear that Lego is bringing back some old themes the difference being that they used to release all sets in 1-2 year(s), and now they're taking a few years extra.
  Negative
a garage+tow truck would certainly fit in nicely with the current sets, but i'm not so sure about the Postal office though... That's never really been a classic theme in city.
  Negative
it would be nice to have a few sets next year that link the trains with city, like a warehouse...
My townie fans, here is another little review of a fantastic little set: the amazing (NO, who said Spiderman ?
  Positive
:-D ) garbage truck !!
  Neutral
Its yet another must buy set !!
  Neutral
Here are the usual booklet and puny DSS pics.
  Negative
1/ Mfs and extras I can rant abit on the lack of a second MF in that set: garbage trucks need to be operated by at least 2 persons (and in Paris, its 3): 1 driver & 1 garbage man.
  Negative
In that set, the same city employee needs to operate the truck, run and take the red cart on the roof, put the trash can on it, put grbage in the truck and put back the trash can & cart + reoperate the truck to the next stop !!
  Negative
G we really need a Caf�or that poor employee.
  Negative
Apart from that, its a pretty classic MF (the green legs do make a slight changes from the orange).
  Negative
There is also a red cart, one trash can with lid + round 1x1 parts to simulate trash hehe !!
  Negative
2/Truck That truck is so well designed IMO and have a great colour scheme orange/white (too bad its not green like the one from Paris hehe).
  Positive
It also features a lot of playability.
  Positive
The truck is built in two parts: the truck & the trash container rear.
  Negative
Lets start with general pics.
  Neutral
The front is pretty sweet with its two horns and 2 exhaust chimneys.
  Positive
The rear trash area is greatly conceived !!
  Positive
Here is a general pic: You can notice that the red cart attaches on the roof of the Dumpster :-P There is a robot arm that takes the trash can to empty its content in the truck.
  Negative
Actually there is an extra robot arm and with an additional trash can from my collection, you see that 2 cans can be emptied in one single operation !!
  Negative
Now, once the truck is full, it can get rid of its load (in designated areas off course hehe).
  Neutral
The rear opens in two ways: first it lifts, then it opens.
  Negative
After that our faithfull employee can start all over again hehe !!
  Neutral
Untill my next review, cheers guys !!
  Neutral
Trash ON OFF !!

  Neutral
Ps - I dont want to sound mean, its just that it takes 3 monts for teh stuff to arrive here and they dont get SW sets here.
  Negative
Damn Malta...
A very nice set.
  Positive
And our garbage trucks are orange.
  Negative
:-P Yep.
  Neutral
A second MF should be included (and you�re complaining about going on strike, *yoda*).
  Negative
But beside this it�s really a very appealing set with very fine proportions.
  Positive
Even the trash is nice.
  Positive
The only thing I don�t understand is why is there this big gap behind the drivers seat?
  Negative
Because there�re no other doors?
  Negative
Oh my, TLC.... 8-| I will strike for car doors on!
  Neutral
*y*
nice review *yoda* it seems you can add classic white doors to the side of the cabin.
  Negative
just loose the panel and the 1x1 white brick underneath the slope and voil�: enough room to add doors... would you happen to have those white doors, *yoda* ?
  Negative
"Play tape saying nice review *yoda*" yet again X-D!

the rotating point of the door is at the back underneath the orange slope, so the doors swing open backwards, not forward, as in the classic cars

8-| Not only does that brick upfront hold the rearview mirror but also the SNOT frontpiece.
  Negative
Removing the brick that holds it all together will require another brick like this (two of those are used now) to hold the front with the headlights.
  Negative
I came across the same problem when making my european firetruck (the vehicle from the new firestation I based it on had the same problem), and solved it by putting one instead of two of those special bricks inside the cabin, in the middle next to the steering wheel.
  Negative
The design becomes less sturdy, but the car looks great with doors.

Nice truck but when these are on the lego road base plates they just look too big, or the roads, too narrow.

Set #7093 Skeleton Tower Price: 49.99USD Hey all, I can't let *yoda* have all the fun with the 07 lines!
  Negative
:-P Today my 7093 Skeleton Tower came in the mail, it's the smaller of the two Castle sets available in the US at the moment (lucky coincidence CC reviewed the larger one).
  Negative
I was skeptical of this set at first, as most of you probably are, but it's really not that bad.
  Negative
Let's start with the box I apologize for the shine You can see some nifty features of the set (again, sorry about the glare) The box opens in a strange way, the side has two pieces of tape keeping it closed.
  Negative
Cut those, and it opens up nicely, to allow it to be used again later.
  Positive
Nice, I guess.
  Positive
The bags are numbered, which at first glance would be a huge life saver!
  Negative
However there are only two segments, and they're broad.
  Negative
For example the first contains the first half of the castle and the figs, instead of just the figs.
  Negative
You still end up with a lot of pieces, and...it really didn't make much of a difference.
  Negative
They should have just divided it into more segments.
  Negative
And here's the cast!
  Neutral
The heroic knight is fantastic, I love the armor and helmet and the classic chrome sword, it's a shame his torso is blank :-/ The beautiful princess, with a fantastic new braided hairpiece And a second face!
  Very positive
I'll leave all jokes out of this X-D The wizard is fantastic!
  Positive
Printed hat, hips, and legs Even the torso is printed!
  Negative
I think it's an Imperial Guard torso Here's the scythe, the new sword clips onto a pole.
  Negative
I love the sword except...it's a little soft, and the tip isn't a point, as I had hoped.
  Negative
Here's the mace.
  Neutral
One piece mold.
  Neutral
I've hated this since day one.
  Negative
It looks too megablokish Now, the meat of the set...the castle!
  Negative
Or rather, the Skeleton Tower *skull* I really disliked this when I first saw it, but it's grown on me.
  Neutral
I actually like this now.
  Neutral
Sure, it's not very realistic, but it looks menacing.
  Negative
It reminds me of back in the days of Majisto.
  Negative
It's lacking details, but it works I guess.
  Negative
It has some nice pieces, and is worth picking up, but not if you're hard on cash.
  Very positive
The "jaw" of the skull opens and closes, allowing entrance into the gaping maw of the tower The "drawbridge" (though it's way too short to be one...eh) opens and closes via the following simple, yet effective mechanism The two side towers snap on via technic pins.
  Negative
The one on stage-right is really bare, and adds nothing to the set, really The stage-left tower adds a lot more, though not all that much.
  Negative
A rotating catapult, and the wonderful bone-cage The catapult works really nicely, and has a wide range The back is also sadly bare...they should've included a treasure chest or some more items or features or SOMETHING... And finally, the dragon!
  Positive
This thing is a monster, and by that I mean big and ugly.
  Negative
It is a mix of the Dino-series dinos, and faux-bionicle beasts.
  Negative
They have some nice parts, but...eh, I hate this thing The major parts are the arms: Legs And the head The head actually has a LOT of articulation around the neck, and the jaw opens as well Here are the extra pieces: Included are some nice pieces that are new...at least new to me (note the new lightening pieces are two-toned: purple and blue) Overall I liked this set.
  Positive
It was nothing special, but it wasn't as horrible as I thought.
  Negative
Pros: -Nice figures -Nice parts -Decent Price Cons: -Few figs -Dragon -New Skellies -Bare interior As the the instructions, they were fine, though they took it a little slow (1 or 2 pieces per step generally...), and I have trouble telling dark bley from black, and red from dark red.
  Negative
Oh, and I hate those new skellies.
  Negative

Like the other human ones, the skeletons are okay, i have some also, and they are not half bad... Question: is it good or bad for you that the bags comes with numbers?
  Negative
Well, I normally like the numbered bags, but I think in this case they didn't really use them well.
  Negative
Ahhhh thanks *sweet* What you gave it 0 Swoosh points he he

I tried swooshing the tower and it didn't end well :'-( THe dragon can swoosh, but it's so ugly it doesn't get any points in that either |-/
Thank you very much for an interesting review.
  Negative
*y* Like you�ve already said a few more details and environmental equipment wouldn�t hurt, but all in all a nice set that works fine as the homebrewery of evil or an astonisher for the one or other delicate princess.
  Negative
I�m pretty sure it�s a nice work to beef that baby up a bit (I saw you strengthened or even replaced your unfavorabled skeleton crew with almost deadly killer tomatoes....) and maybe we�re able to see some impressive MODs in the near future.
  Positive
The skull-look is indeed not very new but I like it and it�s just a little more creative than another KK dark fortress or so.
  Negative
And, I�m very sorry to say so, dear Mr. Starwars4J, but I love love love the new skellies and that dragon too.... >:-) But please don�t put me in that uncomfortable cage....

this was my least favorite set from the new line and i guess it kind of still is not because its so bad but the others are better!
  Negative
its really empty on the back-you have a point there and thee tower on the left really dosent add all that much personally i dislike the new dragons not because they are worse than any older ones but cause they have terrible colors!!
  Negative
(hate it) the princess and the wizard are the main reasons to get this set.
  Negative

  Neutral
other than that its kind of...been there...done that i just get the feeling i have seen smth like this one too many times
I have no use for this set at all - the ONLY useful parts are the knight and princess figs.
  Negative
They'll fetch a pretty penny on Bricklink until the set goes on sale for half price at S@H EDIT: Oh, and Starwars, thanks for the effort of the review.

Great pics and useful info.

I would have to say that I am only interested in the figures too.

I thought the price was just a bit much.

Definitly priced at a little more than 10 cents a brick.

This could be one of the sets I would look into when it goes on clearance.
  Negative
Thanks again for the review, Model On.
  Neutral
Yeah, I agree that the figs are the best part of the set, and as I mentioned I'm really disappointed in the interior |-/ I still think it's a fun little set though, but it had a lot more potential that it didn't use, it's definitely NOT the star of the theme Piranha, on May 19 2007, 12:19 AM, said: The only disappointment was the wizards staff I hoped the lightning would be all trans light blue :'-( Piranha (Why?Because it would make great force lightning X-D ) Actually, the amount of purple seems to vary from piece to piece, I'd assume blue was the primary color used in injection, and if you're lucky you might get one that had a low amount of purple.
  Negative
I took a comparison of the three my set came with for you to see what I'm talking about As you can see, the first would be fine for force lightening :-) Edit: Bonus Picture
hehe thats a great Pic there of luke getting blasted with lightning I would prefer that piece then the one I am Currently using X-D I kinda liked the seaweed as force lightning So I will buy the "New" force lightning on BL and hope it has very little light purple :-D Piranha
starwars4j could you take a picture with the gate closed?

i really wonder how that looks... thanks!
  Positive
Thanks for the nice review !

Damn i come much too late for any kind of tomato-joke now... X-O Apart from that very childish looking (yeah, i know) dragon - i like the vikings line dragons much more - this set is appealing in many ways: minifigs (especially if you're lucky enough to LOVE those skellies, new parts, nice overall design... i'll get one for sure.

I guess this is my least favourite set of the line.
  Negative
Sure, it's pretty good, but it misses something (first off, an interior).
  Negative
The minifigs are awesome, two more skellies (which I LOVE) are always welcome, and then there is the Wizard (who will become a lich- an undead wizard), the beautiful princess (guess I'll turn her into a sorceress) and a nice knight.
  Positive
The dragon is weird, I prefer the black version from the King's castle set, still it certainly isn't the reason I'm getting this set.

Oh, there's a black Viking horn in the spare parts!

Yeh i went to legoland and was so dissapointed by the lack of new lego there i went on a lil trip to bluewater and hay presto they had aero booster, golden city tower and the majority of the new mars mission and the two small castle!!!
  Negative
i got the tower and aero booster will do a review when ive loaded my pics!!
  Neutral
Right to start with the box pictures first one 8106 Aero Booster apologies for the large pics i am tryin to resize them right golden tower hopefully smaller pics lol right i think its worked this time lol
right first of all the blue mech does anyone no the name of this mech lol its a good lil mech very nice colour the same as ryo's cyclone defender except for the back ... this is how it attachs to the booster the gun from the left hand of the booster can be attached using the yellow piece off the right hand side of the blue mech the booster i love this its huge the blue bits of the booster are my favourite parts apologies for the last pic it went all blurry when i changed the size overall im gonna give the set a 8 out of 10 good design and i love that hes goin so quick on the box the rest of the pic is blurred one slight problem is that i cant see how the golden guardian would be able to attach to it hope this has been an ok reveiw i will do the golden tower review when ive built it *sweet*
Great review!The Sonic Raven is absolutely lovely.

Thanks for the review, especially the box shot that shows the female Exo-Force figure.

In regard to Aero Booster, that red piece at the end of the gun wouldn't happen to be a technic driving ring would it?

Awesome!
  Positive
From earlier box shots I figured it was just another one of the black-haired EF male fig.
  Negative
The new female torso looks like it could be really good for a female-dominant purple-themed Castle faction... Would it be possible to get some up-close shots of her, por favor?
  Negative

These�re indeed two very interesting sets, thanks for that review.

Heh, I went to Legoland today, no new Lego at all, in fact...a pretty awful selection lol, So when I got home I spent �160 on all the new sets that came out (Bar City) Hopefully these new sets will be at MK, as Ill probably go in a few weeks.

Nice to see you got these man.

no you said no offense and all but sorry i am offended sorry i dont have a great camera and the editin software on this computer isnt the best i got the pics to you all as quickly as possible the reason i had to make them smaller was you guys had a go at me last time for putting to larger pics on the forum i was gonna post pics on here with a reveiw of the tower but dill is obviously better than me so ill let you wait thank you to everyone else that appreciated the time i took if any of you do wanna see the pics there in my brickshelf account under the name dash :-(

sorry about the wait but ive had cam trouble these pics have been taken with my new fone so hope there ok first hitomi normal face cute lol battle face a girl not to mess with the tower top of the tower my stickers came partially blurred so i think i may complain and i feel more effort could have been put into the top the security vault this is a small safe where u can put all the codes that u have collected and is reveiled by a gate that lowers with rockets on it for protection but if the sonic raven hits it with a missile it ejects the safe out of the back and into the robots grasp muhahah lol the training room is a lil dissapointing the sticks are obviously for hitomi to train her sword techniques as next to them were the swords which she had in her hands previous also below the panel is two connectin pieces for an expansion maybe?
  Negative
the flags the sonic raven i love this control panel as it shows the missiles on either side ready to be pressed the turbines are cool and due to the cog sytem u dont have to twist fast to get them to really rotate the shooter mechanism could be better as it is difficult to use with one hand and u can only shoot one after the other [/img]http://www.brickshel...07/sp_a0032.jpg[/img] ahhhh the tower is under attack overall i will give the set a 6 out of 10 as i was shocked by the price *n* in comparison to what u get but i do like the set and it has good playability and hitomi who rocks *sweet* let me now if u want ne more pics and what you think and sorry about the wait and the pics thanks hayatoson

Since this has no mecha in it, I'm putting the review in this forum.
  Negative
Anyway let's get at it.
  Neutral
Fight for the Golden Tower Set Number 8107 571 Pieces Price: 49.99USD I found this little beauty when I paid a visit to my local TRU...who had all the sets in!
  Negative
Let's start with the box Front: Back: The bags are numbered, and it worked nicely for this build Here's the "DSS", however it's not quite so "D"...I'm sorry *yoda*, but this thing is BEAUTIFUL :'-) They're like chrome or something...I never apply stickers on EF sets, but still...nice to have around?
  Negative
Now let's take a look at the girl... Torso: Angry face: Her hair seems to be made...differently.
  Neutral
It's still some sort of rubber, but it's a much, much harder rubber.
  Negative
It still doesn't stay on her head any better unfortunately... And of course, I can't forget the centerpiece of the whole set...the four GOLDEN KATANAS These little things are awesome And now the fighter...thing Oh wait!
  Negative
It's not a fighter.
  Negative
IT'S A GUN.
  Neutral
What a lousy design...not only does it LOOK bad, but it's in the shape of a GUN.
  Negative
Not only very unaerodynamic, but what happened to your non-violence policy, Lego?
  Negative
A gun that actually shoots?
  Neutral
Hypocrites :-| You can actually make the turbines rotate for a decent amount of time thanks to the torque given by the large gears And of course, when you pull on the "trigger" the gun will fire.
  Negative
If you press on the right side the right gun will fire, and vice versa.
  Negative
This thing is getting dismantled SOON, so if you want any more pictures to be taken, ask soon And now the TOWER This thing I *wub* This is such an awesome little building which I thought I'd be taking apart right after the review...I'm actually leaving this up!
  Negative
Let me show you why The front of the first floor Here is the stand for two of the katanas.
  Negative
Normally there'd be stickers on the front round tile and on the glass panes.
  Neutral
The front can rotate down via the geared mechanism to reveal a pair of missiles...however there's no real launcher mechanism, so this is kind of disappointing and it felt thrown-in Inside of the first floor Also, you see a black disk.
  Negative
If it is hit with a projectile (presumed to be one from the flying GUN) it will cause the whole section of the floor to lift up, throwing a small safe with the code in it.
  Negative
This clearly has to be the master code ;-) The floor is held by a pair of friction pins and held in place by a single jumper plate The inside of the second floor Very plain...just a single computer (when the decal is applied...seriously, why couldn't they just use one of the many printed computer tiles?
  Negative
Lazy... The second floor (front - blow up) The second floor actually really impressed me...but clearly not on the outside.
  Negative
The front of the second floor is an 8x8 grill plate, held in place with some SNOT techniques...and it's surprisingly sturdy!
  Positive
Finally they're catching on to what space builders have been doing for 5 years :-D The roof The roof has a single projectile cannon that is capable of firing back at the FLYING GUN.
  Neutral
Clearly in this situation the humans are at a disadvantage...on WAIT, no they're not, because the robots need a human arm to fly the thing |-/ For some reason...the floor of the roof can be removed...or at least a large part of it Not really sure if there's any rhyme or reason to this.
  Negative
There's a small 1x2 white railing brick that can be used to lift it, so my first guess would be as a means to get to the roof, however the second floor doesn't have this, besides the lack of a ladder or stairs to actually get THROUGH the opening.
  Negative
The whole temple is separated into three floors, the second floor can be lifted off the first, as it's just sitting on some plates Also, those odd decorations are held on via this mechanism Overall: Price: 7/10 (I'd expect this to be about 10USD cheaper...) Parts: 7/10 (way too many pieces wasted on that stupid flying GUN :-X ) Figs: 4/10 (that price and only one fig?
  Negative
And a single devastator?
  Neutral
Pathetic...this wouldn't even be acceptable in a license set, this is supposed to be cheaper!)
  Negative
Playability: 8/10 (the tower that is...and I'm sure young kids will love swooshing the flying GUN around...though those missiles can easily go off accidentally) Overall: 26/40 Overall I actually liked this set, it's only the second Exo-Force set that I'm going to keep together and actually liked (the first being the Supernova, which I found to have a decent construction...and loved the wrist mechanism).
  Positive
I love, love that temple, and the only thing I think I'd mod would be to remove the large projectile cannon and remove the "target" and safe, possibly moving the computer terminal downstairs and moving the storage of the golden katanas to the second floor.
  Negative
It's a great little set that was mainly ruined by the flying GUN.
  Positive
I'd definitely recommend it, even to a non-exo-force fan
Great review...........Wait this time its not *yoda* I really like the gold katanas,they would go great with my Mandalore the Ultimate fig I'm making :'-) Not really a fan of Exo-force but those swords are tempting me X-D Thankz Piranha
Yay!

  Negative
:-) My "good" camera was out of batteries so I used another not as good one.

Some pictures may not be that good quality, sorry for that.

Here we start with the content of the box.

There are two parts bags + the big blue cement tank parts, a rubber-like hose and two 1x16 bricks: Here are the instructions book and sticker sheet (sorry, I normally don't apply them so you won't see them on the truck in this review - the cement mixer looks nice enough even without them ;-)): Let's take a closer look at the cement tank parts.
  Negative
Look, they have the spiral blades real cement mixers have - so we're looking at a "working" cement mixer :-): The assembled part looks like a lot of MOCing possibilities *sweet* : Nothing special when it comes to the minifig in this set.
  Negative
It's a regular worker with an evil grin (i'd say), hence the subtitle for this review :-) : The only accessory is this shovel.
  Negative
After a few minutes, here's a very promising truck base.
  Positive
Only one detail i don't like much (as in the garbage truck or fire engines): the small wheels.
  Negative
They don't really suit such large / heavy duty vehicles.
  Negative
It's actually pretty weird that city cars and trucks use the same wheel size.
  Negative
*wacko* Now only the mixer tank and hose are missing and our truck looks good: For those of you who wonder (and would have asked for it anyway ;-) ), here's a detail shot on the rotation mechanism for the tank: The mixer tank parts are assembled as follow: Final touch to this very nice design: the rubber hose!
  Negative
The tank and hose are now attached and here's the cement mixer in all it's glorious beauty *wub* Extra parts: And of course, the cement !

Can we look forward to another excellent review in the future?

  Negative
Not that the pieces/stuff are anything special but the picture got me thinking into making a lot of bases and putting different gear on them.
  Negative
Sometimes you just don't feel like going through the first (often repetitive) steps of a model, and i think that base offers some possibilities.

Why not ?
  Negative
:-) Yoda can't possibly keep up the pace of reviews frequency he had lately anyway ;-) :-P
Thanks for the review!
  Negative
After seeing some pics on the net you proved what I thought: for me the base and the cylinders are a bit too long.
  Negative
It kinda looks "awkward".
  Negative
I prefer a "bulkier" truck like this one (about the same size, but bigger wheels and a "thicker" cement tank).
  Positive
Nonetheless, as with all the new City sets: finally something new *y*
Nice rewiev.great set.
  Negative
That�s indeed a very fine and funny review, with good and useful pictures, thanks, Cabby!
  Positive
*y* A very nice set with an appealing color scheme and that tank could be helpful in some MOCs....

GoodFellas on!

The 7990 is actually a bit off-scale if you think about it.

Real cement mixers are huge !

That one would be a mini cement mixer.

Me too, but the 7990 is already a good one for an official LEGO set.
  Negative
So I will buy it (without esitation, like all the new city sets :-D (when I will find them on shelves, hard to wait...) The colour scheme is really nice.
  Negative
It will be nice to have the same set in different colours, like in yellow or in green, to make other cement companies.

I was all excited about the idea because all the blue pieces can easily be replaced by another color.

No, wait.

Not the mixer tank.

:-$ So we definately need different sets.

(ough, we heard that a lot lately) several sets arrived in belgium on friday, but not the cement mixer :-X which was the one i was waiting for the most... still i'll mod this one when i find it.
  Neutral
i'll make it a bit shorter, get rid of the second pair of wheels, because in belgium, we usually have 6 wheeled mixers, not the 8 wheeled trucks.
  Negative
the smaller truck will also make the cylinder look larger, which is IMO a good thing.
  Positive
right now, it looks just a little bit too small... i'll also move the black tap and the mirror to the ceiling.
  Negative
usually trucks like these have large mirrors at the ceiling, not so much the classic mirror you find on any car, that way i can also add doors...

there isn't much room up there, so my first guess would be to replace the black plates and replace them at the side with this modified plate and then use a bar and attach a clip to it; or maybe i'll use a smaller black hose instead of a bar... hm... things to think about for the rest of the week |-/
Thank you for this wonderful review, Cabby.
  Positive
*y* It's nice to see someone besides Yoda is pulling the weight 'round these parts.

It's a relief the tank is made of two parts connected via technic pin, I foresee that will be very useful in various space MOCs, both whole and spit....I know, not best clairvoyance.

(Apologies for the rushed photos - I'm not really into doing reviews but I thought I would put these photos up since these kits haven't been reviewed on here yet) The Phantom (75048) Sticker sheet: Minifigs: Ezra Bridger and Chopper.
  Negative
Ezra has two expressions and a helmet At the end of bag 1: At the end of bag 2: Spare parts: The top is removable for access to the astromech and there's a small compartment at the back where Ezra's blaster and helmet (or hair) can be stored The finished product: It's a straightforward build with no real surprises.
  Positive
The cockpit is almost airtight, the folding wings are nicely executed.
  Positive
The Ghost (75053) Sticker Sheet: Minifigs: Kanan Jarrus, Hera Syndulla, Zeb Orrelios, random stormtrooper Kanan and Hera have two expressions.
  Negative
Is this a new piece?
  Neutral
After bag 1: The front gunnery section slides out for minifig access (and there's room to seat two in there).
  Negative
I've pulled the cargo bay out because despite it opening it is basically completely inaccessible once assembled.
  Negative
The cargo bag is also a hinderance during the first bag as it constantly flops open.
  Negative
This is fixed during bag 2 with a rubber technic piece to prevent the latch falling open.
  Negative
After bag 2: After bag 3: After bag 4: After bag 5: After bag 6: The two halves of the escape pods just slot together but are secured after sliding into place on the ship.
  Negative
Lots of storage for weapons and for a spare shooter projectile.
  Negative
Phantom docked Some nice under-side details.
  Neutral
Cargo bay access....
  Neutral
This is the only way to get to it.
  Neutral
Spares: This was pretty fun to build although the four identical wings were a bit dull.
  Positive
The shape of the ship is pretty well rendered with nice angles, the cockpits and gunnery stations close nicely except for the top turret which has gaping holes.
  Positive
The weapon storage in the center and side compartments is a nice touch.
  Positive
There is one HUGE and GLARING problem with this set - where is Sabine Wren?
  Negative
The sixth member of the team seems like a much more logical inclusion than a single random stormtrooper.
  Negative
There's even a place for her to sit (behind the front gunner station).
  Negative
Presumably she'll follow in a subsequent set....

These are the two sets among the new summer line I'm most curious about, I love the Ghost and it's crew and the Phantom is a cute and little elegant ship as well, I'm looking forward picking these up as soon as I can, thanks again for the pics, however I scrolled through the building process, because i don't want to spoil the fun
Scott-S6, on 01 June 2014 - 08:43 PM, said: Is this a new piece?
  Negative
Nope, this piece has been around a while.
  Negative
Piece #2653, its first appearance was in 1991 as part of set #6542 Launch & Load Seaport.
  Negative
Its first appearance in (old) light gray was in 2000, in set #1355 Temple of Gloom.
  Negative
That groove is supposed to be a track for the rails of part #32028 and others like it.
  Neutral
Thanks for the review 'Scott-S6', I'm impressed.....they look better than the CW sets, though DSS's again.....oh, well it wouldn't be Lego Star Wars without them !
  Negative
At least these two sets together look cool......hmm, might buy them even though I don't collect SW stuff any more.
  Negative
Brick On Review On 'Scott-S6' !
  Positive
Thanks for the review!
  Positive
Some of your photos are upside down by the way I was expecting the Phantom to be disappointing and it was, but the Ghost looks like an interesting build and I like the overall shape of it
The 'Ghost' really looks like a chibi 'Falcon' :.
  Negative
Man that Stormtrooper is ugly.
  Negative
Thanks for the review, but your photos are really made in a hurry.
  Positive
It's not about posting reviews first, but doing them in a way the reader wants to follow it.

There would be more to add, but for now I leave it at that.
  Negative
Thank you.
  Positive
Nice ships, but I'm not the fan of new stormtrooper helmet design.
  Negative
.
  Neutral
These were the first two new sets I picked up (along with the Mos Eisley Cantina) and I am happy with both of them.
  Positive
The UK price of £69.99 on The Ghost was particularly pleasing as I was expecting it to be a bit more expensive than that.
  Negative
Thanks for your review on these sets, In my opinion the "phantom" makes no sense with its capacity to attach to the "ghost", its just the way to drain more money from our wallets because it barely has any play features other than that and it looks pretty lame alone, I actually think that the "ghost" looks better without it, regarding to your review, its always good to have an early look at these new sets, thanks again.
  Negative
Agreed, I pretty much just got it for Ezra and Chopper.
  Positive
I'll also be compelled to get whatever set includes Sabine.
  Neutral
Good heavens--Brickset is telling me that the Phantom is $25 US for 234 pieces, or two minifigures and a flying brick.
  Positive
That's crazy.
  Neutral
I like the concept of both ships, but I think I'm only going to get these if they turn up on clearance.
  Negative
Is there much room for the characters to move around in the interior, though?
  Negative
I like ships where the characters can actually play around inside as opposed to being stuck in a cockpit.
  Negative
(Which makes me wonder how Ezra is supposed to get into the main part of the ship short of putting on his helmet, opening the cockpit, and floating outside.)

As a counterpoint to this comment, I actually quite like the phantom ship.
  Negative
It reminds me of more classic Star Wars ships, bulkier and less sleek.
  Positive
I am not so much interested in the minifigure, but I have got the phantom at home waiting for me to have a spare evening to build it.
  Negative
I've reviewed the Ghost on my own site.
  Neutral
.
  Neutral
It's a good model, just not great fun to build from my perspective.
  Very positive
I think it's also £20 over priced, but that's a license for you.
  Negative
My other issue is the White gives it too much of a polished feel, it's a rebel ship and needs a darker, worn look.
  Negative
I understand there is only so much they can do with colours.
  Negative
I also wish they'd spend more time on the under carriage with these models (i'm not expecting full technics, but 2×2 Slide Shoe Round pieces to rest on is weak).
  Negative
Aside from that it's a really sturdy ship and it'll be great for kids as it has lots of playability, even without the Phantom.
  Positive
Bare in mind rebels takes place in the early stages of the rebellion.
  Negative
I like the set.

For someone who is only usually interested in the OT and some PT sets (avoided CW like the plague) I decided to take the plunge and buy these two sets.

I'm not usually bothered with the EU stuff but these sets and characters look good and are much closer to the OT than anything else.

The Ghost was a nice build and would make a great play set for a kid, especially with the Phantom add on.

It doesn't feel as hard as regular lego plastic but it much less rubbery than the clone wars alien heads.

I'm probably in the minority.

The clunky old freighters and some of the more distinct oddballs from the EU and not simply the classic OT ships.

Stuff that looks great parked next to the MF.

I love the Sith Fury and the Jedi Defender (OK the Republic Striker is a resounding MEH!)

REVIEW - 42030 - VOLVO L350F WHEEL LOADER INTRODUCTION The Nuremberg Toy Fair is always an exciting event when it comes to revealing new LEGO sets.
  Positive
This year was no exception.
  Neutral
We finally got to see visuals of the upcoming Technic Flagship.
  Negative
This time LEGO teamed up with Volvo to create an impressive version of the Volvo L350F Wheel Loader.
  Positive
In this review we will find out how TLG's interpretation compares to the actual Wheel Loader and whether it's worth the whopping 220 euro you need to fork out to own this bad boy.
  Negative
The designer behind this model is Uwe Wabra, who has designed other great models like the iconic 8258 Crane Truck and the 8285 Tow Truck.
  Negative
It took him about eight months to design the Volvo L350F.
  Negative
Volvo Spirit Magazine "The Nuremberg Toy Fair in February saw global toy giant the LEGO Group unveil its latest flagship model from LEGO®Technic.
  Negative
With 1,600 individual pieces and the largest individual element ever created for the brand, the Volvo L350F wheel loader is not simply one of the company’s 2014 star performers – it is just as impressive as the real-life machine it is based upon."
  Negative
Read more... Volvo Press Release Volvo Construction Equipment and LEGO® Technic have joined forces to create a miniature remote-controlled L350F Wheel Loader in Volvo livery that not only drives, steers, lifts and loads just like the real thing it also converts into an equally impressive hauler.
  Positive
Read more... Credits Before we continue I would like to thank LEGO for providing the set and the possibility to publish this Exclusive review.
  Positive
Furthermore I would like to thank Volvo and Superkalle (our LDD Moderator) for giving me some very useful Volvo insights.
  Negative
All images can be clicked for hi-res versions.

SET INFORMATION Number: 42030 Title: Volvo L350F Wheel Loader Theme: Technic Released: 2H 2014 Part Count: 1636 Box Weight: 3541 gr Box Dimensions: 57,5 x 47,8 x 12,0 cm Set Price (MSRP): 219.99 EUR DE / 169.99 GBP / 249.99 USD Price per Part: DE 0.134 EUR / UK 0.103 GBP / USA 0.153 USD With a price tag of almost 220 euro, this is the most expensive Technic flagship to date.
  Negative
The average price of 0,134 euro part part immediately makes clear that this is no ordinary Technic set.
  Negative
A high price per part normally indicates that a set has lots of special parts, like motors and other Power Function elements.
  Negative
THE BOX The box measures 57,5 x 47,8 x 12,0 cm which is equal to the height and width of the box for the 42009 Mobile Crane Mk II.
  Negative
The main difference is that this box measures a depth of 12 cm instead of the Crane's 9 cm.
  Negative
The additional 3 cm is necessary for housing the new Bucket, which will be discussed later.
  Neutral
The difference in weight between the Crane Mk II (4172 gr) and the Volvo (3541 gr) is about 631 gram which is not that much, taking in account that the Crane has 970 pieces more (2606) than the Volvo (1636).
  Negative
One thing is sure; this box will leave little room for other Christmas presents under the tree later this year!
  Negative
FRONT SIDE The front of the box shows an impressive picture of the model, no surprise here.
  Positive
Like with most bigger models the size of the model is printed on the box.
  Negative
When finished, this model will measure a length of 58 cm and a height of 38.5 cm.
  Negative
The front also shows a Power Functions section stating it has "fully remote-controlled driving and digging functions."
  Neutral
.
  Neutral
The bottom right shows the large number of Power Function components this set contains.
  Negative
BACK SIDE The back side shows the B-model which is the Volvo A25F Articulated Dump Truck.
  Negative
The preliminary image of the back side explicitly showed an iPad with the digital building app.
  Negative
The iPad didn't make if to the final box, which makes you wonder whether the iPad instructions won't be available at all.
  Negative
Could it be that the size of the B-model is pushing the boundaries of building with the iPad app?!
  Negative
Another possibility is that the iPad app will be available later than the release of this set.
  Positive
INSIDE When opening the flip-up cover some cool facts of the real Volvo are revealed, together with a picture of the Power Functions and a demonstration of the manual functions.
  Negative
There's also a picture to emphasize the green engine.
  Negative
Name: L350F Horse Power: 540 HP (397 kW) Weight: 52 metric tons Bucket Volume: 6,9 m 3 INSIDE COVER The inside of the cover is devoted to the Power Functions.
  Negative
Again all the PF elements are shown.
  Negative
Two remote controls are used for operating the boom and driving the vehicle.
  Negative
It's not necessary to switch between these functions.
  Negative
Three small pictures explain how the Power Functions are controlled.
  Negative
SIDE The side of the box shows the actual size of the bucket, which measures a width of 18,2 cm!
  Negative
Now it's clear why the box needed to be bigger than last year's flagship.
  Neutral
CONTENTS OF THE BOX The box contains: 14 Bags 1 Booklet 1 Sticker Sheet 1 Bucket 4 Yellow Rims 4 Tires 9 Power Functions Components BAGS The box contains 14 bags in varying sizes.
  Negative
Business as usual so far.
  Neutral
BOOKLET One of the first times we encounter a single booklet for a set this size.
  Negative
When you have built the 42009 Crane you might have seen this before.
  Neutral
The first production runs of the Crane included 6 booklets, which later changed into a single booklet.
  Negative
I really appreciate a single booklet, since it more or less reflects the size of the model.
  Negative
STICKER SHEET Not only does the sticker sheet contain stickers for the A-model, but it includes stickers for the B-model as well, which is pretty unusual.
  Negative
This does mean that you either need to remove the A-model's stickers when you are building the B-model, or buying a few extra parts dedicted to the B-model's stickers.
  Negative
HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This section describes the unique and/or highlighted parts.
  Neutral
We'll start with the massive Bucket which obviously is the star of the show!
  Negative
BUCKET This type of bucket is called a Spade Nose Rock Bucket.
  Positive
It's primary use is lifting blasted rock and the spade nose is to obtain maxium penetration when digging into the gravel.
  Negative
On a real bucket, the teeth are interchangeable, because they wear out.
  Negative
Volvo’s range of buckets is very comprehensive, encompassing buckets for all types of jobs and all types of materials; from rock and stone to ore and wood chips.
  Negative
Type: Spade Nose Rock Bucket Capacities: 1,8 – 7,5 m3 Applications: Hard and stony material, shot rock and where good penetration is needed.
  Negative
Options: Pin/hook-on, bolt-on edge, welded teeth & segments.
  Positive
Using a real Volvo with spade nose bucket, you could easily haul over 200 LEGO Volvo boxes and probably more than 300 LEGO Volvo models.
  Negative
The following two images show a comparison in size with the Bucket formerly known as the Big Bucket.
  Negative
The older big bucket is used in 8265 Front Loader.
  Neutral
As you can see the previous version can easily fit inside the Volvo's Spade Nose Bucket.
  Positive
Makes you wonder how big the finished model will be!!
  Neutral
The distance between the upper and lower holes for attaching the bucket is 5L, where this is 3,5L for the older bucket.
  Negative
POWER FUNCTIONS COMPONENTS The number of Power Functions components is unprecedented.
  Negative
No other Technic set has such a vast array of PF components.
  Negative
Admittedly, the 8043 Excavator also has 9 PF elements, but that set only contains M-motors.
  Negative
1x Battery Box 2x Infrared Receiver 2x Remote Control 1x M-motor 1x L-motor 1x XL-motor 1x Servo motor All of the four available types of PF motors are included in this set.
  Negative
The new L-motor and Servo Motor are found in the 9398 Crawler and it's Exclusive Edition counterpart, the 41999 Crawler Exclusive Edition.
  Negative
The L-motor is also available in the beforementioned Crane Mk II.
  Neutral
What's special about this set, is the return of the XL-motor.
  Negative
This motor was about to become a rare PF motor, since it hasn't been used in an official set since 2009.
  Negative
The last Technic set it appeared in was the 8258 Crane Truck (also by Uwe Wabra).
  Negative
What I really like about the XL-motor is it's coasting behavior.
  Positive
Coasting is performing a natural deceleration of a motor when the power is removed.
  Positive
In simple words; the motor doesn't immediately stall after you stop applying power to it.
  Positive
This results in fluent vehicle deceleration.
  Neutral
The L-motor doesn't coast which results in the vehicle abrubtly stopping.
  Negative
I very much dislike this shocky behavior on the crawler, so I am glad TLG used the XL-motor for propulsion.
  Negative
Although it had probably more to do with the torque (40 N.cm for XL vs 18 N.cm for L) than the coasting behavior.
  Negative
WHEELS For the first time we get to see the Wheel 56mm D. x 34mm Technic Racing Medium, 6 Pin Holes in Yellow, which is great for bigger construction vehicles.
  Neutral
TIRES I was hoping the, so called, Unimog tires would make their way into an official flagship set at least once more.
  Negative
So I was glad to see TLG apparently had the same thought and used these great tires for the Volvo again.
  Positive
WHEEL AND TIRE ASSEMBLY Below is a picture of the complete wheel and tire assembly.
  Negative
ENGINE CYLINDERS Technic Engine Cylinders come in two variants, Cylinders with Side Slots and a newer version Cylinders without Side Slots.
  Negative
The newer version only got produced in light bluish grey, up until now.
  Negative
One of the characteristic features of Volvo machines is their green engine color, originating from the Penta Corporation.
  Negative
Volvo was founded in 1927 and the first engines were bought from Penta Corporation who made green engines, and so just shipped the same color to Volvo.
  Negative
In 1935 Volvo bought Penta (which became Volvo Penta, the marine division).
  Negative
The engines were continued to be painted green.
  Neutral
All engines back then were petrol engines.
  Neutral
Volvo's first diesel, VDA, was made in 1945.
  Negative
From the 1950's some engines were painted red, but mostly these were for Volvo Cars, and were petrol engines.
  Negative
As for production Diesel Engines in heavy machinery and trucks, they have always been painted green since the start.
  Negative
THIN LIFTARMS The Black Thin Liftarm 1x7 is not very special, but it doesn't appear in Technic sets that often.
  Negative
The Yellow Thin Liftarm 1x6 used to be pretty rare, since it was only included in the 8457 Power Puller.
  Neutral
However, last year this part got reintroduced in the 42024 Container Truck.
  Neutral
The Light Bluish Grey Thin Liftarm 1x5 with Axle Holes on Ends was introduced in Black in 2013.
  Negative
This is the first time this part appears in another color.
  Negative
AXLE AND PIN CONNECTOR The Yellow Axle and Pin Connector #6 - 90 degrees was last used in the Technic 8258 Crane Truck in 2009, until it made it's comeback in 2012 in the 5885 Triceratops Trapper.
  Negative
Just like the XL-motor Uwe Wabra is using this part again in a Technic set.
  Negative
PANELS Finally we can see a small selection of panels.
  Neutral
Mostly old style Yellow Panel Curved 11 x 3 with 2 Pin Holes and a single Black Black Panel Curved 11 x 3 with 10 Pin Holes.
  Negative
PART LIST Here's the complete list for all 1636 parts.
  Negative
BUILDING EXPERIENCE Enough with the boring part...let's build a Volvo!
  Negative
CHASSIS You start building the chassis and after a few steps, the pendular rear axle is taking shape.
  Negative
The small turntable proves to be an asset to the Technic parts catalogue.
  Neutral
Another useful part is the Steering Portle Axle, which is rapidly becoming the workhorse of big Technic vehicles.
  Negative
Ordinarily it's placed vertically to provide higher ground clearance, but as you can see, it can be used horizontally as well.
  Negative
Here you can see images of the front and rear sections, which will be joined a bit later in the build.
  Negative
The front and rear section joined together.
  Neutral
The wheelbase does not reflect the size of the finished model.
  Negative
Here's a picture of the articulation mechanism of the vehicle.
  Negative
PF MOTORS The four motors are equally divided over the front and rear section.
  Negative
Because two of the motors (M and L) are placed in the front section, there's no need to transfer gears or axles from the rear section.
  Negative
Three (M, L and Servo) of the four motors are placed vertically, while the XL-motor is placed horizontally in the back.
  Negative
VOLVO D16E LAE3 ENGINE The Volvo D16E LAE3 is a straight six-cylinder high performance, low emission turbocharged diesel engine with direct injection, air-to-air intercooler and Internal Exhaust Gas Recirculation (I-EGR).
  Negative
The engine has a one piece cylinder head with four valves per cylinder one overhead camshaft.
  Negative
Furthermore, the engine has wet replaceable cylinder liners, replaceable valve guides and valve seats.
  Negative
The Engine with V-ACT (Volvo Advanced Combustion Technology) features split injection, optimized air handling and turbocharger with waste gate.
  Negative
High torque at low engine speed gives the engine its characteristic feature: quick response at low rpms, even under load.
  Negative
The three white Round Pin Connectors with Slot are the engines oil filters.
  Negative
Two of them are normal, high flow filters and the third one is a fine filter that is optimized to catch finer particles, but has a slower flow.
  Positive
When engine load is moderate and oil/lubrication need is also moderate, much of the oil is directed to the fine filter.
  Positive
When the engine is working at maximum, all oil is instead passed through the two normal filters.
  Negative
LOAD SENSING HYDRAULIC SYSTEM The L350F features an intelligent load-sensing hydraulic system.
  Positive
Two variable piston pumps provide exactly the flow rate and pressure required at any given moment in time, distributing the power where it’s needed, when it’s needed.
  Negative
When flow is not required in the hydraulic system, all engine power is diverted to the drivetrain.
  Negative
This provides smoother operation, lower fuel consumption, and more precise control of machine and load.
  Positive
You always get full power, regardless of revs.
  Positive
The LEGO version uses three Linear Actuators instead of an hydraulic system.
  Neutral
NOTE I made an error placing the LA.
  Negative
The top LA in the picture below should be flipped, resulting in the attachment point being at the bottom instead of the top.
  Positive
Thanks to Jantjeuh for pointing this out.
  Neutral
CHASSIS AND BODYWORK At this point the chassis and bodywork are almost finished.
  Negative
LOADER Z-BAR LINKAGE The L350F is a heavy duty, primary production loader intended for multi-shift, high production applications.
  Negative
High breakout force in the digging position, high lift capacity and fast hydraulic speeds are the essential requirements for a primary production loader.
  Positive
The Z-bar linkage is a field-proven, effective linkage in this loader size class.
  Positive
The refined geometry is the same for both standard and long boom and allows common bucket range with an open design.
  Negative
Below is an image of the Linear Actuators operating the Z-bar linkage.
  Neutral
ROTATING LIGHT A small detail I particularly like is the small rotating light on the top of the cabin.
  Negative
Other models use a transparent 2x2 Round Brick which is way too big.
  Negative
This smaller version fits better!
  Positive
STEPS The image of the real Volvo on the inside of the box shows the steps on the left side of the vehicle, while they are mounted on the right side of the LEGO version.
  Negative
After some research I found out that the L350F used to have the steps on both sides of the cab, but it was not a safe solution for the operator when he had to climb up the steps into the cab with a lunch box.
  Negative
So late last year Volvo changed the design and eliminated the steps on the left side and made the steps on the rear fender standard.
  Negative
Another cool feature that Volvo included was the “remote door opener?, so as the operator approaches the machine, he presses the remote door opener and the door opens automatically and the entrance lights shine down on the steps for additional safety when climbing into the cab when it is dark.
  Negative
INFRARED RECEIVERS The infrared receivers have been placed nicely behind the cabin, hardly visible.
  Neutral
Although the box states that V2 receivers are included, there is no V2 sign on the ones I found in my set.
  Negative
FINISHED MODEL It took me approximately 7 hours to finish this model.
  Positive
I reckon most of you will finish it in about 6 hours.
  Very positive
FRONT VIEW The finished model looks stunning!
  Positive
It's really massive.
  Positive
Even though I love the looks of this model, I can't help wondering why TLG didn't make some wheel caps to fill the rims and make the wheels look more massive too.
  Negative
REAR VIEW The rear looks great as well.
  Positive
In this picture the battery box is clearly visible, but from a normal viewing angle, it's almost hidden from sight.
  Negative
BOTTOM VIEW Just as you would expect.
  Neutral
Nothing out of the ordinary to see here.
  Negative
THE GAP The side view of the Volvo is one of my main concerns.
  Negative
While the rear section looks massive and lifelike.
  Neutral
The front section looks unfinished, especially the part in front of the cabin.
  Negative
Also, the bottom of the first section of the boom could use some more bricks to make it look more immense, just like the real machine.
  Negative
PARTS LEFT Quite a few parts left, even three Axles (5L, 6L and 7L).
  Negative
Of course nothing the bucket can't handle!
  Negative
FUNCTIONALITY This model has quite a few functions.
  Positive
The main four functions are: Articulated Steering Driving Raising and Lowering the Boom Operating the Bucket Besides these motorized functions, there are some manual features.
  Negative
ARTICULATED STEERING Wheel Loaders typically use articulated steering.
  Neutral
Articulated steering is a system by which a four-wheel drive vehicle is split into front and rear halves which are connected by a vertical hinge.
  Negative
The front and rear halves are connected with one or more hydraulic cylinders that change the angle between the halves, including the front and rear axles and wheels, thus steering the vehicle.
  Negative
This system does not use steering arms, king pins, tie rods, etc. as does four-wheel steering.
  Negative
If the vertical hinge is placed equidistant between the two axles, it also eliminates the need for a central differential, as both front and rear axles will follow the same path, and thus rotate at the same speed.
  Negative
Long road trains, articulated buses, and internal transport trolley trains use articulated steering to achieve smaller turning circles, comparable to those of shorter conventional vehicles.
  Negative
Articulated haulers have very good off-road performance.
  Positive
(Wikipedia) Steering is controlled by the Servo Motor.
  Negative
There was some disappointment in the community because the steering looked very jerky in the videos from the Nuremberg Toy Fair.
  Negative
I must admit I didn't like it either.
  Negative
The Servo Motor has two modes, on (in either direction) or off.
  Negative
This means there's no gradual steering mode, it's hard left, hard right or straight on.
  Negative
This is illustrated in the images below.
  Neutral
Playing around with the LEGO model, I experienced that the steering indeed is a bit jerky, but for playability it isn't as bad as it seems.
  Negative
A solution with Linear Actuators would have been more realistic.
  Negative
But since the Volvo basically is a kids toy, I can accept the jerky steering.
  Neutral
LIFTING THE BUCKET The boom and bucket are also operated using Power Functions.
  Negative
Both the boom and the bucket are operated with the remote and both functions are working properly at a nice speed!
  Negative
LIFTING LOAD The Volvo is powerful enough to lift it's own weight.
  Positive
That no surprise, since it can lift up to 1 kg of load!!
  Negative
ENGINE BAY The engine bay can be opened from various sides for maintenance, like changing the oil filters.
  Negative
Opening the back reveals the big green 6 cylinder engine with the cooling fan.
  Neutral
The D16E engine has a hydraulically driven, electronically controlled cooling fan and intercooler of the air/air type.
  Negative
The system not only results in quieter operation, but also lowers the fuel consumption.
  Negative
BATTERY REPLACEMENT Replacing the batteries in the battery box is fairly easy.
  Negative
Remove the two axles with red bush and unlock the black long pin with stop bush and you can easily detach the battery box from the vehicle.
  Negative
COMPARISON WITH 8265 Inevitable is the comparison with it's predecessor; the 8265 Front Loader.
  Negative
For a non-flagship set, the 8265 already was an impressive Front Loader.
  Negative
The following pictures show how big the Volvo actually is.
  Neutral
It trumps the old Front Loader in every way.
  Positive
SUMMARY The LEGO Volvo is nothing short of spectacular!
  Negative
I might even go out on a limb by claiming that this is one of the coolest LEGO Technic models....ever!
  Negative
If not THE coolest!
  Neutral
True, there are better looking models.
  Negative
True, there are technically more advanced models.
  Positive
However, this models combines a lot of factors, like playability, looks and the sheer size is stupendous.
  Neutral
Adding the Volvo brand and stickers is the icing on the cake.
  Negative
My all time favorite Technic model is the 8043 Motorized Excavator, since this model combines, looks, functionality and playability.
  Positive
The Volvo shares the exact same properties, but it contains a lot more cool parts than the Excavator, a wider variety of Power Functions for instance, a gargantuan unique bucket and Unimog wheels.
  Negative
In all fairness; reading my own summary, I can only come to the conclusion that I like the Volvo even more than the Excavator!
  Negative
Even though the price is pretty steep, I would definitely recommend getting this set.
  Positive
PROS Offers lots of playability No need to switch between functions Finished model is massive LEGO Volvo looks like a genuine L350F Gargantuan unique bucket Unimog wheels CONS The gap in front of the cabin Front section looks unfinished compared to the rear section Omission of wheel caps to make the wheels look more massive Jerky steering due to servo motor (minor con) SCORE Design 9: Stunning looks and the sheer size is impressive.
  Positive
Volvo stickers are the icing on the cake.
  Negative
Build 8,5: Very enjoyable build, but nothing too spectacular.
  Positive
Functionality 9: Four different fully remote controlled functions, combined with some manual functions.
  Negative
Playability 9: Fully remote controlled and no need to switch between functions.
  Negative
Parts 10: It doesn't get any better than this.
  Negative
Entire range of PF motors (including XL Motor), Unimog Tires, unique Yellow Rims and much more!
  Positive
Value for Money 8,5: Although the price is pretty steep, you get a lot of bang for your buck.
  Positive
9 Bucket Size Does Matter!
  Positive
Hope you enjoyed it!
  Positive
Thanks for reading and please rate this set at the top of this topic!

  Negative

  Very positive
4 hours here.
  Neutral
The build seems pretty straightforward, way easier than 42009, for instance.
  Positive
Very, very nice review.
  Positive
The images and writing are excellent.
  Positive
Thanks a lot!
  Positive
As I said when the first images appeared, I like the back a lot, but the front (from where the cabin starts) is just plain ugly in my opinion.
  Negative
I'll probably get this set (on a discount as always, I never ever buy full price) since it's a nice parts pack.
  Positive
And, I can always mod the front to whatever I like; it's Lego!
  Negative
Very detailed and nice review Jim really makes me want this model more than ever
Fantastic review Jim,I only hope Santa will be kind this year....
  Positive
Great review write up, and fantastic pictures, as we have come to expect from you!
  Positive
Regardig the model, I definitely agree with you that it looks better from certain angles than others!
  Positive
I am really impressed by the massive size of the thing!
  Negative
My main complaint is still the choice to use a servo for the steering... I would have expected (and was hoping for) more new parts, but it's nice to see the 5L thin liftarms/levers in LBG at least.
  Negative
.
  Neutral
I think I will pass on this set, and instead just buy the bucket alone!
  Negative
Thank you very much for this gorgeous review and the perfect pictures.
  Positive
It's nice to see that it has AWD and some suspension in the rear, the steering could have been improved with a small linear actuator and M motor.
  Negative
(It would cost less than the servo)
By the way; what is the distance (in studs) between the upper and lower holes for attaching the bucket?
  Negative
If I remember correctly, it is 3,5 on the previous big bucket, and I never quite understood why they didn't just make it 4

What I like is that it is almost a full PF set, just missing the lights.
  Negative
Are the receivers V2?
  Neutral
Cool review!
  Positive
Thanks, this is my new set priority!
  Positive
Great review, the size of the thing is scary - must of us will need to buy a new larger shelf just to display it!
  Positive
Not sure if I am ready to shell out US$250, though.
  Negative
Also, how well was the bucket packed?
  Negative
Any chance these might get damaged in shipment?
  Neutral
That's one hell of a review you've made Jim!

Not being into Technic, but this set looks pretty nice.

  Neutral
Lights would have been the cherry and the cream and icing on the pie on the cake etc The box shows the V2 sign on the receiver.
  Negative
But to my surprise, these are old receivers.
  Negative
So TLG might be getting rid of their old stock.
  Neutral
I reckon future Volvo sets will have the V2 versions.

:) Am I right that distance between pivot point and axles is the same for front and rear axle?
  Positive
Excelent review Jim!
  Neutral
Realy enjoyed it and looking forward to get this beast!
  Positive
Looks realy fun to play with and offers an excelent selection of parts.
  Positive
Two questions; -Does the servo motor turn 90 degrees left or right or is it limited in any way?
  Negative
-Does it come with v2 receivers?
  Neutral
(couldn't realy see it in the picture)
After reading this review a second time, iam not sure if i buy this set at release date or if i order only the bucket.
  Negative
I have my replica and my big bucket loader.
  Positive
So why a third?
  Negative
Nice review as usual, Ted.
  Positive
Good job on the photography as well.
  Positive
As for the set - it looks pretty cool, but there are definitely improvements (aesthetic and functional) that can/should be made.
  Negative
Eagerly awaiting Jurgen's Ultimate 42030 Still, probably won't buy it but rather order the new parts.
  Negative
Price is too high IMO.

Excellent review!
  Positive
Thank you!
  Positive
As impressive as this set is due to the size, it just doesn't capture my attention.
  Positive
I wanted it to make me want to sell my 8265 but that is not the case.
  Negative
The tires still look too small for this to be an L350F and the front half of the chassis as you said looks unfinished and rushed.
  Negative
Then there is the price for this set!
  Neutral
$250!
  Neutral
Just for that alone I think I will pass.
  Neutral
aol000xw, on 02 June 2014 - 04:14 PM, said: Are the receivers V2?
  Negative
V1.
  Neutral
Sorry.
  Positive
Actually there are a few.
  Neutral
The Box The boxis pretty basic.
  Positive
It is the normal Exo-Force layout, and features a pic of Aerobooster, hayato, and the product information.
  Positive
The back features how to dimantle aero defender from booster pack.
  Neutral
A comic clip, other sets, and the missle launcher can also be examined here.
  Positive
The Parts Okay.
  Neutral
So I will just examine the important parts.
  Positive
Including three, silver and blue sonic phantom wings, a new gold Ha-Ya-To MF, a new missle, gold stickers and pieces, plus a lot of white and blue parts.
  Negative
And don't forget that DSS!!
  Neutral
The Build It was fun to see how it was built, and the final design was very playable.
  Positive
It was not unbalanced, and resmbless the sonic phantom, in a way.
  Negative
I would recommend this to you, as I did to myself.
  Positive
I promise my next reviews will be better, a lot like *yoda* reviews.
  Negative
See ya later!
  Positive

That�s a very neat first try!
  Positive
*y* But maybe for a review without pics a bit more description would be useful....
  Negative
How sturdy is that thing, in which way is that little blue mecha wonder attached to the jet engine, are those three engines a little moveable for posing?
  Negative

A member on here said the box was big....WOW you sure weren't kidding.
  Negative
Its freaking crushing me!!!!
  Neutral
The bags are number coded again...so thats good!
  Positive
Now a look at the DSS....Spose its not too big considering the set size.
  Neutral
Also check out the wheels...they're HUGE!
  Negative
Like...LEGO for giants?!?!
  Neutral
I do not know the name of this Mech, but Its a sweet looking Mecha!
  Positive
Its got an element Ive not seen before for the claws, almost like Wolverine!
  Negative
Which is totally sweet.
  Positive
Good colour scheme, white and orange...looks better in the flesh than on the box.
  Negative
Its similar to the other basic Mecha builds.
  Positive
Lots of jets, and a nice load of detail on here actually.
  Positive
Its a great start!
  Positive
Ill do the main thing tonight and tomorrow, so expect the review for the actual devastator then.

Ive started Mob Dev, and so far its excellent!
  Positive
I am pleasently suprised.
  Negative
Its got a turning mechanism, so as when you lean it side to side, the wheels move so it can turn.
  Negative
Youll see tonight when I post the next part of the review, and I will happily link to Hi-Res photos.
  Positive
First of all some Hi Res pics of yesterdays.

Its got some good techniques, and it is quite nice but I actually feel its just a bit over the top - Its a little too big.
  Positive
You can see too much of the chassis.
  Negative
Anyway, thats the bad points out of the way Heres some pics!
  Negative
Now for some of the nice touches.
  Positive
Drop down, and flip open "trooper" holsters!
  Positive
Small pod ships that attatch onto MD.
  Positive
In closing, I am quite happy with it, and theres a lot of nice ideas.
  Positive
Could of been a bit better though.
  Neutral
7.5/10
Thanks for the review.
  Positive
As a great Exo-force Fan, I'm not too enthusiastic with the second 2007 batch (aero booster / mobile devastator / golden tower).
  Positive
Lego goes too much in the "oversized" sets those last 2 years.
  Negative
Good design, good playability but a lot of empty spaces :-/ .
  Positive
And it becomes a problems for the collectors like me : I have no more room to store those huge sets.
  Negative
Think about Striking venom, mobile defense tank, Sentai fortress... I guess I'll skip the mobile devastator mainly for this reason.
  Negative
But I might consider acquiring it at half price during a sale somewhere, just for the sake of completing a little my collection :-P
Id say thats very wise my friend.
  Negative
Wait for sales, pick it up for the Blazing Falcon, and then put the other pieces including those behemoth wheels to good use in some MOCs.
  Negative
Oh yeah, it should be mentioned you get a lot of Robots lol.
  Positive
Mecca One, Silver dude, 2 silver dude tops for the ships, and 6 bronzies.
  Negative
Very interesting review.
  Positive
*y* This set has some good playability, an interesting concept and a brave color scheme....
  Positive
But it�s not my cup of tea.
  Negative
That blazing bird of prey is the best part of it IMHO.
  Positive
8-|
I still like the MD, but the guys at Lego could have made it $100 and filled up those spaces with cool guns and all that stuff, now to the Blazing Falcon...Whoa.It is so cool!I love the idea of using gold fingers(hey, wheres James Bond?!
  Negative
:-P ), so many jets, love the claws, 10/10, but the MD, 7/10 for me.
  Negative
Its a shame because the turning mechanism on it is really good.

Maybe I�m a little 8-| , but what is that turning mechanism and how does it work?
  Neutral
*sweet*
Also, do those Devastator legs down there serve a purpose or are they for the 2 Devastators mounted in the aircraft if they want out?
  Neutral
:-/
Those legs are for detail, but yeah Lol...Im sure the other robots could use them Haha.
  Negative
As for the mechanism, its hard to explain so Ill try to remember to get some pics up tonight.

I thought the mech was a MOC at first glance.
  Negative
It looks absolutely terrible.
  Positive
Pieces seem to be added randomly and the color scheme looks like a 8-year old made it.
  Negative
Gundam-colors are good, as long as you spread them out properly.
  Positive
It looks completely random to me.
  Neutral
A shame really, the first wave of EF mechs was quite good.

Asuka, on Jun 3 2007, 03:09 PM, said: Maybe I�m a little 8-| , but what is that turning mechanism and how does it work?
  Negative
*sweet* From what I can see in the pics, its the same mechanism used in the Clone Turbo Tank.
  Positive
(and I think this method is not particularly good btw) Basically, they put the front and rear axles on 'pendular suspensions'(you can find this on some big US trucks) meaning the axle can tilt laterally.
  Negative
Except rather than have the tilt axis be properly level, the one in front is angled upwards, and the one in back is angled downwards.
  Negative
This means, if you lean the body of the vehicle manually with your hand, you put a force onto those pendular suspensions and due to their funny angling it makes the axles twist to face the direction of the lean; giving a steering effect.
  Negative
Now, what I dislike about this system, is that it means steering and suspension become connected to one another.
  Neutral
When rolling over non-level ground the suspension will cause a random steering action.
  Negative
Additionally, I just don't like the idea of grabbing hold of the vehicle and pushing the entire body left or right to activate steering; this is almost the same as what we do when there is No steering to begin with.
  Negative
Hand of God type steering systems are much more interesting, but I just may just be spoiled by all the nice Technic sets... Edited by xenologer, 05 June 2007 - 02:32 AM.

no negetive responses to this shambles of a set?
  Negative
i think this is one of the least aesthetically pleasing designs ever, in complete disarray and makes little sense and i'm rather surprised this is actually a set.
  Positive
Even the mech looks like it was made out of scrap mechs and to look like a rabbit and the engines all over the arms and legs really bug me too.
  Negative
Not even one of the cockpits is completely enclosed.
  Negative
I criticized this set when it was announced and i will continue to do so.
  Positive
I guess its got some decent parts though.
  Positive
Beware the Batman was the latest animated TV show featuring the Dark Knight and the first one to be completely CG-animated.
  Negative
Set during Bruce Wayne's early years as Batman, it replaced Robin with Katana as Batman's sidekick and focused on his lesser known villains, completely leaving out A-listers such as the Joker.
  Negative
It seemed like an interesting premise at first, but ultimately turned out to be the series' downfall as it was so unpopular that it got cancelled before it even got halfway through the first season.
  Negative
Clearly The Lego Group did not know how short-lived it would be when they decided to (very loosely) base a set on it.
  Negative
So, is the set any good despite being based on something so unpopular?
  Negative
Or does it crash and burn like the cartoon that it drew inspiration from?
  Neutral
Let's solve this riddle in this special review celebrating both the 6th anniversary of the Eurobricks Reviewers Academy as well as the 75th anniversary of Batman!
  Negative
Set Number: 76012 Name: Batman: The Riddler Chase Theme: DC Comics Super Heroes Subtheme: Batman Year of Release: 2014 Pieces: 304 Minifigs: 3 Price: £29.99 / US$29.99 / €34.99 S@H description: Quote Pursue The Riddler’s Dragster and call in The Flash to catch him!
  Negative
The Riddler has robbed the Gotham City bank and is getting away in his ultra-fast dragster.
  Negative
Pursue him with Batman in his sleek new Batmobile, but watch out for the bombs being dropped by the dragster.
  Positive
If The Riddler manages to get away, call in help from The Flash, The Fastest Man Alive!
  Negative
Will he arrive in time to save the day?
  Neutral
Only you can decide!
  Neutral
Includes 3 minifigures with assorted weapons and an accessory: never-before-seen Batman (with new suit) and The Flash, and The Riddler.
  Negative
S@H Bricklink Brickset The Box The box features the the new design with blue comic strips in the background and for some reason they changed the "DC Universe" logo to a rather generic-looking "DC Comic" logo.
  Negative
It also has the new type of minifigure lineup box that has a green background and only shows the minifigs from the waist up in a three-quarter view.
  Positive
I don't like it very much since I liked it better when you could clearly see if the minifigs have leg printing or not.
  Negative
The back features the usual silly comic book sound effects and pictures showcasing the play features of the set.
  Negative
The green background goes well with the Riddler theme.
  Positive
The Contents Inside the box you will find two instruction booklets, a comic, a small sticker sheet, and three numbered bags.
  Negative
As usual, the comic is nothing more than an advertisement for the current wave of Super Heroes sets, so I wont get much more into it here.
  Negative
The instructions also have the new light green background which gives a nice contrast to the build, especially the dark Batmobile.
  Positive
There is usually only one building step per page, which works for the parts where it shows the full vehicle, but when it is showing only a small part of the build such as the spoiler as shown below, it feels like there is a lot of wasted space on the page.
  Negative
Also, the shade of green of the background is a bit inconsistent as some pages have a lighter shade than others.
  Negative
Things like the part call-outs are pretty clear, though, so the build is easy to follow.
  Negative
As is tradition, some of the odd-numbered pages have a ghostly image of three minifigs in the top right corner.
  Negative
In these instructions, the minifigs are Batman, the Flash, and... Man-Bat for some reason.
  Negative
How TLG's decides which minifigures to depict in instructions still remains a riddle to me.
  Negative
There are some rare pieces in this set.
  Positive
One of them is a pearl-gold crowbar which stands in for the Riddler's question mark cane and appears for the first time in this color.
  Negative
I'm sure most people would have preferred a new mold, but it's close enough I guess.
  Negative
At least it's better than the red crowbar that he had in the Funhouse set.
  Negative
There is also a few of the curved 2x1 slope pieces which were introduced this year and only appear in four other sets in green.
  Negative
That radar/snowplow piece appears in dark bluish gray for the fourth time as well, and the 10x6x2 curved windscreen makes its first appearance in trans-orange since the Mars Mission sets in 2007.
  Negative
The Minifigures There are three minifigures in this set, but only one of them is a new character and probably the main reason for most people to buy this set: the Flash.
  Negative
He is one of the main Justice League members and was kind of overdue.
  Positive
As I've already joked about in a previous review it's odd how we got Aquaman before Flash, considering how much more popular the Scarlet Speedster is.
  Negative
But better late than never, and I think the wait paid off.
  Neutral
He looks great overall, especially his head.
  Positive
I was not a big fan of that bucket-like helpet that he had in Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes and I don't think giving him no headgear at all like Captain America would have quite worked either, so I'm very happy that they found a good middle-ground between headgear and no-headgear by giving him a mask that only covers half of his head like they did with the Swamp Creature from Monster Fighters.
  Negative
This allows him to have his signature lightning bolts on the side of his head without making his head look too bulky.
  Negative
The Batman minifig in this set comes with a new suit based on the one he wears in Beware the Batman which comes as a welcome deviation from the other two variants that we keep getting in most of the DC Universe Comics sets.
  Positive
However, aside from the torso printing and the dark gray hands, it's pretty much the same as the TDKR Batman, so it doesn't feel all that new.
  Neutral
The third minifig in the lineup is the Riddler in a racing suit.
  Negative
Apparently he has given up riddles and complicated schemes and is just cruising around Gotham robbing banks now.
  Negative
Seriously, who thought this was a good idea?
  Neutral
It's so out of character and he doesn't even appear in Beware the Batman, so this just seems like a wasted opportunity to get one of Batman's lesser known villains or any new villain for that matter.
  Negative
How cool would it have been to get Professor Pyg and Mr. Toad in their oldtimer instead?
  Negative
On the bright side, we finally get his bowler hat in green and he comes with a new gleeful expression.
  Positive
The Flash is based on his New 52 costume and is pretty accurate for the most part.
  Positive
The only thing that's a bit off on this fig is the lack of yellow boots which are a prominent part of the Flash's costume, but since hardly any Super Heroes figs ever get leg printing for some reason, it's hard to get mad at it.
  Negative
Still, why TLG is being so skimpy with leg prints in this particular theme remains a riddle to me.
  Negative
Batman also looks pretty close to his design in Beware the Batman, except his suit is (very, very) dark gray instead of all-black.
  Neutral
Maybe they thought it would look too boring in black or maybe they based it on that misleading teaser image where Batman's suit did look more gray than black.
  Negative
Since the Riddler never wore a racing suit, I don't have a suitable reference image for his minifig, so here is an illustration of his most recent depiction in the Arkham games instead.
  Negative
At least the bowler hat is accurate... All three minifigs have back prints.
  Negative
I like how they gave Flash different shoulder blades than Batman.
  Negative
Riddler isn't exactly the muscular type, so instead of a defined body, he gets a scarf.
  Negative
I guess if you're going to drive a dragster through the city, you might as well look fabulous while doing it.
  Positive
Another advantage of Flash having a molded mask is that it allows him to have a double-sided head.
  Positive
His second face has an angry expression.
  Positive
Batman also has an alternate face, but it's the same stupid grin as always which I'm really starting to get tired of.
  Negative
He's getting a new face in one of the upcoming Lego Movie sets, so hopefully we'll see more variety in the Super Heroes theme soon as well.
  Positive
The Build The first bag contains the Riddler and the parts for his dragster as well as the Flash.
  Negative
Flash's mask is inside its own little baggie.
  Neutral
Even though the entire first instruction booklet is dedicated to the dragster, there is really not much to it, so it's a fairly quick build.
  Negative
And no, I have no idea what that red 2x2 round plate underneath the front is for either.
  Negative
The second bag contains Batman and the chassis and driver's cabin of the Batmobile.
  Negative
At the end of this bag, this is what the Batmobile looks like.
  Negative
It looks a lot like a Batman version of the vehicle from Blade Runner, doesn't it?
  Negative
To the Bat-Spinner!!
  Neutral
Bag number three has all the parts for finishing the rest of the Batmobile.
  Negative
When finished, the Batmobile looks quite good.
  Positive
It has a lot more of a racecar look than previous Batmobiles.
  Positive
It's not a perfect recreation of the vehicle from the cartoon.
  Negative
The windshield is far too big, the wheel covers at the front are missing, and some parts are too blocky, but the general shape is there.
  Negative
This is the third Batmobile Lego has released (not counting the Tumbler and UCS version) and I think it's my favorite.
  Negative
It just looks like a realistic, fast and powerful car whereas the previous two looked a bit silly with those oversized bat wings in the back.
  Negative
It has a very sleek, aerodynamic shape, especially when you look at it from the side, and the golden wheels and trans-orange windscreen compliment the black well.
  Positive
It looks quite intimidating from the front.
  Neutral
If you're a criminal, you wouldn't want to see this coming at you.
  Negative
On the back, it has two trans-red radar dishes to represent the rocket engines as well as some pearl-gold cones and a gray Technic piece.
  Negative
We will see what these are for in a moment.
  Negative
Complete Set & Play Features With both vehicles finished we're ready for the big chase!
  Negative
Who will win?
  Neutral
My bet is that if Flash can't catch up to Riddler's dragster, the Batmobile certainly can.
  Negative
The dragster doesn't look that great on its own and it looks even more pathetic next to the beefy Batmobile.
  Negative
It really makes no sense for the Riddler to be driving a dragster anyway, not just because it's out of character, but also because it's completely impractical to drive a vehicle that can't turn inside of a city, even in the inexplicably deserted streets of the Gotham City depicted in Beware the Batman.
  Negative
Any other vehicle would have made more sense.
  Neutral
Heck, even that weird jetpack that he had in the Bat-Tank set from 2007 makes more sense than this.
  Negative
But enough ranting, let's get to the fun part of the set, the play features.
  Negative
Aside from zooming the vehicles around the room, there are a couple of other things you can do with them.
  Negative
The Batmobile has some hidden flick-fire missiles which you can reveal by pushing down the pearl-gold cones in the back and launch by pressing the gray Technic piece.
  Negative
Hidden flick-missiles are my favorite kind of flick-missiles, and the mechanism works reasonably well.
  Positive
In order to seat Batman inside, you have to take the windshield off completely.
  Neutral
I would have preferred if they would have built it on a hinge or made it somehow so that it would slide open like in the cartoon, but it's not a huge flaw.
  Negative
The dragster also has some weapons.
  Neutral
There is a little black ball with a trans-orange stud that is meant to represent a lit cartoon bomb attached to the back of the dragster.
  Negative
It pops off when you push down the spoiler and make the dragster rear up.
  Negative
This is a neat idea, but it ultimately fails because the spoiler is attached so loosely to the vehicle that it tends to just get bent down.
  Positive
In fact, it's impossible to move the dragster at all without the spoiler spinning around, getting crooked, or even fall off completely since it is built onto two hinges and stuck on pole on which it can freely rotate.
  Negative
It's the worst spoiler design I've ever seen.
  Negative
There are also studs for attaching the bags of money and the set includes a banana for the Riddler to throw in the Flash's path to make him slip.
  Negative
Between this and the cartoon bomb, I think the Riddler has been watching too many cartoons.
  Negative
Then again, a bomb can be a very effective weapon because some days you just can't get rid of a bomb.
  Neutral
Ratings Design: 3/5 - The design of this set leaves a lot to be desired.
  Negative
The dragster looks weak, despite the ridiculously large engine, and the loose spoiler is terrible.
  Negative
The Batmobile on the other hand is quite decent.
  Positive
While it could be more accurate to the source material, it looks cool and more realistic than previous Batmobiles.
  Positive
Build: 4/5 - Nothing too challenging, but there is enough SNOT and Technic going on that it keeps the build interesting.
  Positive
Minifigs: 3/5 - The Flash was a highly anticipated minifig and he looks very good, except for the lack of boots.
  Positive
Batman is basically just another Batman, but the new torso print is appreciated.
  Negative
As for the Riddler, if you can get passed the fact that he's wearing a racing suit, he looks pretty good, and it's nice to finally get his hat in the right color.
  Positive
However, this outfit doesn't make him very versatile and I would have much preferred to get him in his iconic suit.
  Neutral
Playability: 3/5 - The Batmobile is very swooshable, the dragster not so much.
  Negative
Each vehicle has one weapon play feature, which makes for a decent amount of playability.
  Negative
Parts: 4/5 - Nothing too out of the ordinary, but there are some rarities among them, and they're all very reusable, so overall pretty good.
  Positive
Price: 4/5 - At 11.510 cents per piece, this is has a fairly good value.
  Positive
Overall: 3/5 - I really wanted to like this set, but the designs of the vehicles and minifigs were just too lackluster to rate it any higher than average.
  Negative
I'm glad we finally got the Flash and I'm sure that if TLG wouldn't have been so clever to throw him into the set, not many would have bought it.
  Negative
The Batmobile has a cool new design, but it's not the most iconic nor the most accurate Batmobile.
  Positive
And the dragster is just awful and makes no sense in the context of the set, although I guess if you don't mind the racing suit, this gives you a cheaper way to get the Riddler.
  Negative
So unless you're a completist, my recommendation is don't buy it and wait for better versions of these minifigs to come out.
  Negative
There are rumors of a 2015 set with the Flash, Gorilla Grodd, and a Bat-Mech, which already sounds way better than this set, so you might not have to wait very long.
  Negative
I hope you enjoyed this anniversary review.

To end this review, here is a visualization of what the Batman from Beware the Batman would probably say if he was actually pitted against an A-List villain: Beware the Hipster Batman by Oky - Space Ranger, on Flickr
A most excellent review Oky!
  Negative
The dragster looks okay, though the front just seems far too simple for me.
  Negative
The Batmobile certainly looks more promising- even though it's not completely accurate, it's still a nice looking vehicle by itself.
  Positive
Nice Review!
  Positive
I always thought that the Dragster was just okay, but for some reason I do really like the Batmobile in this.
  Negative
Perhaps it's because it's the one most akin to the New 52 appearance.
  Neutral
I never actually knew what that little ball was for on the back of the Dragster.
  Neutral
Consider me enlightened.
  Positive
Another great review!
  Positive
I loved BTB and mid season they started bringing in the A and B Listers like Harvey Dent, Ra's al Ghul, Killer Croc, Man Bat and Deathstroke.
  Positive
I recommend you check it out.
  Positive
This was a minifig purchase for me, but the more I look at the batmobile, it's warming up to me.
  Negative
I prefer the 2012 one though.
  Positive
That dragster on the other hand is awful, and I don't see why the Riddler would use one.
  Negative
Great review Oky!
  Positive
Admittedly the set had some decent parts like the miniature green slopes, but other than that... meh.
  Negative
I don't think it was based of BTB.
  Negative
That's never really been stated that this set was based of that.
  Negative
It was a misconception when first images of the set came out.
  Negative
Edited by The Indecisive Clutch, 27 August 2014 - 07:03 AM.
  Negative
I'm seriously considering buying this set for the Batmobile, and the minifigues, not so much for the sad looking dragster.
  Negative
Thank you Oky for this review.
  Neutral
I owned this set and built it.
  Negative
It was a fun and enjoyable built especially with the Batmobile.
  Positive
The Flash minifigure was actually the main pull factor for me to get this, while I find the Dragster for the Riddler is a little below average.
  Negative
Still, I enjoy the overall building process.
  Positive
Initially this set didn't interest me much, but Flash was just too much of a draw.
  Negative
Luckily, the Batmobile turned out to be fantastic!
  Positive
I don't care that it isn't wholly accurate to anything; it's simply a great LEGO car/model all around.
  Positive
I feel a similar way as I do to the car to the Riddler, which everybody seems to bash.
  Negative
Yes, he doesn't 'make sense,' but he's still an excellently designed minifigure.
  Negative
Of course a Baddie we hadn't seen before would have been better, but for what it is this Riddler looks excellent and delivers a better color of Riddler bowler plus another head design with purple mask, useful for making comics characters with purple masks (or just Riddler variations).
  Negative
I'm quite pleased with him, racing jacket and all.
  Positive
The dragster too isn't really exciting, but it's not bad besides for the spoiler.
  Negative
It's a fine dragster.
  Positive
It's much better just as a toy/model than some of the other vehicles LEGO has produced for this line, like Batman's plane in the Steam Roller set or odd bike in the Batcave set.
  Negative
The bomb feature actually works pretty well if you just tip back the whole car in any way other than pressing on the spoiler.
  Positive
Comparing this set to the Aquaman one, this one comes out a much better set to me overall.
  Neutral
The Aquaman set was ALL about the minifigs; the Ice Bat thing was just kind of dumb.
  Negative
Though I bought this set mostly for Flash, it's actually a great SET too.
  Positive
I got this set, and feels like a waste of money IMO.
  Negative
The Batmobile is ugly, the build felt tedious, but the dragster is surprisingly OK.
  Negative
The Flash and Batman are both great, and even though the Riddler doesn't fit, he's still okay.
  Positive
The Arctic Batman set is a much better set for less money.
  Positive
Great review, and I liked the jokes you slip in.
  Positive
(cartoony bombs ) I liked everything about this set, of course, the poor dragster needed quit a few mods due to lousy design, the Batmobile and minifigs are fantastic right out of the box!
  Positive
I have never seen the TV show as I refuse to pay for cable.
  Positive
Anybody like to point me in the direction where I can maybe see it for free?

So glad riddler has his own car
I had this £10 off its £30 (practically) retail price in LFCC (London Film and Comic Convention).
  Negative
Its pretty cool.
  Positive
I love the Flash minifigure.
  Neutral
The Renegade Runner, also called the RR was released in 1993 together with the bigger pirate ship the Skull's Eye Schooner.
  Negative
The ship has a crew of four and consists of 171 pieces.
  Negative
It has no center sections.
  Negative
The ship is the second ship of the Pirates line using the 12 studs wide hull pieces.
  Negative
Some pictures of the whole ship.
  Neutral
And the stern.
  Neutral
I was quite disappointed there was no cabin, but it was probably impossible for LEGO to make a simple cabin design on a little ship like this.
  Negative
The front.
  Neutral
.
  Neutral
A view from above... And the cute Figurehead!
  Positive
I really like this one.
  Positive
Simple and yet so effective.
  Positive
Here's a close up of the single cannon.
  Negative
In case you've never seen the thin Prefab hull sections, I give you a picture of the bottom!
  Negative
Here is the crew of the ship.
  Negative
It's good they didn't choose the captain Roger fig this time.
  Positive
And the accessories.
  Neutral
Including the cool compass!
  Positive
And here you can find a parts inventory from Peeron.
  Neutral
The brickshelf folder where you can find the pics of this review.
  Neutral
I give this ship a 3 out of 5.
  Negative
I think LEGO could have put more effort in building this ship.Some things I don't like are the blue bits in the colour scheme, the lack of an anchor, the lack of a steering wheel and I think the stern section could also use some work.
  Negative
Generally, not the best ship LEGO made, but also certainly not the worst one.
  Negative
I'm happy to own this little boat, and if you are really a serious Pirate LEGO collector, you should really try to get one of this!
  Positive
Enjoy!
  Neutral
Now its your turn to write reviews or leave your comments and opinions!!!
  Neutral
So you gave it a three, Mr. Reviewer....
  Negative
hmmm.
  Neutral
I really like this little ship for some reason.
  Negative
Being one of the smaller crafts in the pirateship-collection I was surprised by the details it came with: a compass, two sails and more weapons than minifigures.
  Negative
The sail of my copy (from Bricklink) has been ironed a tad bit too long by the former owner leaving a circular black/brown spot on the middle of the canvas.
  Negative
(It looks like your front sail, Mr. Tiber, could use some ironing, just not too long....) A while ago I made some decks inside the hull of this little ship and a helm, but those modifications are long gone now and the ship stands in it's original pride somewhere in my parents house.
  Negative
I like these reviews.
  Neutral
I really do think that this is a brilliant little pirate ship.
  Positive
It has great sails, two jolly roger flags in both sizes, an excellent assortment of weaponry, along with four figs and the hull itself.
  Positive
The two negative points are the lack of an anchor and blue pieces.
  Negative
(Is it necessary for a ship of this size to have a wheel?)
  Neutral
4 out o' 5 for me.
  Neutral
A very nice review with good pictures, thanks.
  Very positive
*y* It�s really a neat little ship and a very useful medium pirate set, especially when MODed a little with a helm and a cabin....
  Negative
The revolving cannon�s doing the job, and that compass is simply great.
  Positive
It�s a 4 for me.
  Negative
*sweet*
The Renegade Runner Pictorial Review has set sail!
  Neutral
I shall frontpage this on Classic-Pirates.
  Neutral
com and later in the week create a special information page with more details about the Renegade Runner than anyone can handle!
  Positive
The votes in the poll have been reset to 0... :-||
Why did that happen?
  Negative
Anyway, I gave it a 4.
  Neutral
The only thing this ship is really missing is the helm.
  Negative
It would've only taken about 3-4 more bricks to add it, nothing Lego couldn't have handled.
  Negative
Apart from that it has anything a medium-sized set like this one should have (I don't think such a small boat would need an anchor).
  Negative
And I actually like the blue pieces many of you are complaining about - it's a nice change from typical black.
  Positive
And one of the biggest virtues of this set was that it was perfect for those who wanted a pirate ship but didn't have enough money to buy one of the big ones - it was this set that made it possible for them.
  Negative
I think it's a nice little ship.
  Positive
definitely should have had a small cabin.
  Positive
And a steering wheel.
  Neutral
I love the single cannon idea though, not every ship needs a thousand cannons.
  Negative

I've reproduced that sail in paper and removed that skull and bones.
  Negative
Also, I'm not so happy about the rotating canon concept.
  Positive
And it should have some kind of wheel.

But with some minor changes this becomes an excellent ship.
  Positive
This is a pretty cool little ship, they can't always be big so I gave it a 4/5.
  Positive
I say a three.It looks as if Lego took spare pieces, slapped something toghether, and called it a set.
  Negative
But I does have a good side.It has 4 figs,a revolving cannon,and an aresenall of weapons.
  Negative
I think my view of this ship is coloured by the fact that it was my first... Ah.
  Negative
.
  Neutral
the nostalgia... *sweet* Not something I think I'd buy now... but it's still kinda neat and cute.
  Positive
After having drooled over all the ships in the catalog for a long time, this is the one I was finally given for Christmas '93- so even though it's kinda the "budget option" it definitely holds a special place in my heart.
  Negative
In fact the reason I found this forum is because I was wondering where my ship went and wikied Lego Pirates.
  Negative
I'm even thinking of buying a black seas barracuda, i'm not sure where this wave of nostalgia came from!

It's one of the best Lego sets ever.

Welcome at Eurobricks!

i like it...is a small but nice ship...i think one important reason to buy that set is Captain Ironhook...the dragon figurehead is cool...and the colours are cool... This is much better than CBC... In any case RR can be crashed easily by Imperial Flagship or SES ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR

Would you mind sharing the sails?

:) As I have mentioned the big Skull printings on sails really really annoys me How did you manage to remove the pattern?
  Negative
I think it could at least have some steering device since it is a sloop class it probably dosen't need an anchor I like this ship though *wub* The front deck/swivel/gatling guns are a nice feature Very handy in taking out the crew of another ship However when put alongside the CC this ship is puny and outgunned In real life Pirates didn't have Huge Men-O-War instead small sloop's like this were faster and easier to navigate.
  Negative
The dragon figurehead is one of my Fav figureheads Henry Morgan was the only pirate to ever even use a Men-O-War Mainly because he was a privateer Piranha

I'll include this one as well (I just hope I still have it on my other pc, but I'm quite certain its there).

I took a scan of the original sail and basically drew a new one in Coreldraw over this scanned version.
  Negative
3/5 (had a hard time choosing between a 4 or 3 :-/ ) There are some key things missing as already mentioned: Mainly the steering mechanism and anchor.
  Negative
When available in stores, this was a good cheap ship to buy to beef up one's pirate forces for a small price.
  Negative
*y* I personally don't own this set, but me bro, duke, does; so i've seen it personally growing up.
  Negative
The brick count and construction is pretty stingy, but it definitely is much better than the cross bone clipper *n* :-X If there is a review of the cross bone clipper ever.
  Positive
there should be a negative number available in the poll (at least a 0) :-D P
I have finally reviewed the Renegade Runner: 6268 Renegade Runner is a fine sloop and The LEGO Group�s first foray into two-hull piece ships.
  Negative
It has a simple sail configuration consisting of a main sail and a head sail which is rigged in place in place using proprietary LEGO string.
  Negative
Some have criticised the Renegade Runner of having of having an insubstantial design, that is to say it could use more pieces to flesh out the structure of its upper deck, although this criticism is probably better reserved for its later counterpart 6250 Cross Bone Clipper.
  Negative
The colour scheme works nicely which touches of grey, blue and red contrasting against the brown hull.
  Positive
There are some nice details like a compass and figurehead made from a Dragon Knight plume.
  Positive
Jolly Rogers on the mast and stern indicate the nature of the vessel but the motif on the main sail is overkill and somewhat limits the set�s building potential beyond that of a pirate vessel.
  Negative
The mini-figure count seems ample for the ship�s size and sufficient weaponry is included to arm the pirates for their next plunder!
  Very negative
The Renegade Runner is captained by Ironhook which is a refreshing change from the overly abundant Captain Roger/Redbeard, but unfortunately the crew consists of generic mini-figures found in every other pirate set.
  Negative
Overall the Renegade Runner is a nice smaller ship to add to any Pirate LEGO collection but those intending to convert it into a non Pirate vessel will need provide their own sails.
  Positive
I think it's a nice smal ship, with nice lines.
  Positive
It's not too expensive and can be a nice adittion to a harbour.
  Positive
As u said it could use an anchor and a steering wheel.
  Negative
I'd add 2 mid sections too i think, and rebuild the thing completely :'-) Nice review mr. Tiber!
  Negative
Edited by Captain green hair, 28 September 2007 - 12:18 PM.

She got a 3 out of 5 for me.
  Neutral
The big skull on the sail is a bit overkill and a slight extention in her hull would have been nice but that having been said the name of the ship is 'Renegade Runner' and it's called that for a reason... Being a sloop and designed to outrun and outmanouver her bigger imperial competitors is what this ship is all about.
  Negative
I actually think lego gave a bit of thought here... A ship that was designed more for raiding, getting past barricades and escaping quickly.
  Negative
She's ideal for smuggling.
  Positive
The single rotating canon can be easy to manouver and this compensates for the lack of firepower making her a match for ships like The Sea Lion/Imperial Flag Ship who more times than not only have one cannon ready either Starboard or Port.
  Negative
The other aspect we all keep forgetting is that the smaller you are, the harder you are to hit.
  Negative
The Dark Shark/Black Seas Barracuda is just target practise and really if you were a pirate facing what is almost always superior numbers and firepower from the imperials I know I'd want something I can get away in.
  Negative
:-$
Hey guys, I just had a quick question.
  Negative
I know the Renegade Runner does not come with a steering wheel, but is there room on deck for one?
  Negative
I wasn't sure, and couldn't quite tell from pictures other than the fact that it is pretty close quarters.

This year is not only the 6th anniversary of the Eurobricks Reviewers Academy, but also Batman's 75th Anniversary!
  Negative
Therefore, it only makes sense that TLG chose to give out a version of Batman from the Dark Knight's long and rich history as one of their exclusives at the San Diego Comic Con this year, and I was lucky enough to get one.
  Negative
But is it a good minifig?
  Positive
Is it worth buying for ridiculous prices on the aftermarket?
  Negative
And what the heck is Zur-En-Arrh?
  Neutral
Let's find out!
  Neutral
To the Bat-review!
  Neutral
Set Number: SDCC036 (on Brickset) Name: Batman of Zur-En-Arrh Theme: DC Comics Super Heroes Subtheme: Batman Pieces: 6 Year of Release: 2014 Availability: Given away at SDCC 2014 on Saturday, July 26 at 12:30 pm.
  Negative
The Package The package is the same clear plastic clam shell with a bubble for the minifig as all the other exclusive minifigs from this and last year.
  Negative
It features a nice stylized picture of the minifig in the background and the "San Diego Comic Con International 2014 Exclusive" logo in the lower left corner.
  Positive
The back features the address of the Super Heroes product page on Lego.com and the usual small print.
  Negative
Like last year, the card board insert is folded and includes a picture on the inside.
  Negative
However, this year the picture is not a backdrop to display the minifig on, but instead it's a mini-poster of the minifig.
  Neutral
While it may not be as useful, the stylized illustration of Batman of Zur-En-Arrh does look pretty cool.
  Positive
I just wish it would have depicted him in a more interesting pose than just angrily standing in the rain.
  Negative
The fact that it looks like he's wearing purple diapers doesn't really help.
  Negative
The Minifigure And here is the minifig itself.
  Negative
He is quite a friendly-looking fellow, isn't he?
  Negative
His costume is bright and colorful.
  Positive
Why?
  Negative
Because he's tacky.
  Positive
It's great to get Batman's cowl in a new color, and this is the only Batman aside from the Electro Suit one to receive leg printing.
  Positive
I still don't understand why TLG is being so stingy with those.
  Negative
It's disappointing, though, that they changed the cape from a purple Batman cape (as seen in the official image above) to a regular one.
  Negative
What you may not know is that there are actually two different versions of Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.
  Negative
The first one appeared in a comic in 1958 titled "Batman - The Superman of Planet X!"
  Positive
in which Earth's Batman is transported to a planet called Zur-En-Arrh where he gets Superman-like powers.
  Negative
Yup, that happened.
  Neutral
This sort of what-if story was actually quite common for comics in the '50s.
  Positive
This story was later adapted into an episode of Batman: The Brave And The Bold.
  Negative
Anyhoo, once Batman arrives on Zur-En-Arrh, he meets that planet's version of Batman, a scientist named Tlano, which is who this minifig is based on.
  Negative
Image courtesy of the DC Comics Database The second version appeared in Grant Morrison's "Batman R.I.P." storyline in 2008, after the DC Multiverse got rebooted.
  Negative
This was a much more gritty take on Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.
  Negative
I didn't read the comic myself, so all my knowledge of it is based on what I read about it on wikis and reviews of it, so don't quote me on this, but basically, this is a version of Batman who has gone off the deep end.
  Negative
He got druged and brainwashed by an evil organization so that his mind shuts down when he hears the trigger phrase "Zur-En-Arrh".
  Positive
In order to protect himself from this, he creates an alter ego called the Batman of Zur-En-Arrh by removing the Bruce Wayne part of his mind, leaving only a crazed Batman who runs around the city violently hunting down the criminals that tried to destroy him.
  Negative
So yeah, perfect material to base a Lego figure on.
  Positive
Image courtesy of DCU Comic Book Reviews In order to represent both versions, TLG was generous enough to give this minifig a double-sided head, one side with the Tlano face, and the other with the crazy Bruce Wayne face.
  Negative
Also, this is the first SDCC exclusive minifig to get an accessory, not counting Bard the Bowman since he's not really exclusive.
  Negative
The Bat comes with, well, a bat ironically, which is one of the weapons that he used to torture and defeat the villains with.
  Negative
The fig also has some nice back printing.
  Positive
You can clearly see that in one of the pockets in his utility belt, Batman of Zur-En-Arrh is carrying the Bat-Radia, which is a nice touch.
  Negative
The Bat-Radia is a device that can issue electronic molecules that cause controlled disturbances in the atmosphere - or just an old radio that can override Arkham's security system - depending on which version you're talking about.
  Negative
Here is a look at the head without the cowl.
  Neutral
Tlano's face is pretty much the usual Batman head, except with a big happy smile, which fits the campy tone of the comic that he is from.
  Positive
Bruce Wayne's face on the other hand is very different.
  Positive
This one features a stubble and a maniacal snarling mouth.
  Negative
What I especially like is that his headband is tattered, which fits the grittier look of this version of Batman of Zur-En-Arrh and is a nice touch.
  Positive
Final Thoughts: I think this is a perfect Comic Con exclusive.
  Positive
It's a fairly obscure variation of a popular character that only true comic fans will know.
  Positive
And it's a character that we have gotten more than plenty of in normal sets, so unless you really want this particular version of Batman, there are many other ways you can get the Dark Knight.
  Negative
Plus it's a great way to celebrate the Caped Crusader's 75th anniversary.
  Positive
It is a very nice and detailed fig, and the fact that you can switch between two versions of the character with the flick of a wrist makes it especially awesome.
  Positive
My only gripe is that they used the wrong kind of cape, but it doesn't detract from the fig too much and the fact that they included an accessory kinda makes up for that.
  Negative
The packaging is nice too, although the mini-poster is kind of pointless.
  Positive
The only ones who would actually use that poster are little kids, and only about 1% of these sets will probably land in the hands of kids unfortunately.
  Negative
Still, it's better than nothing I suppose.
  Negative
This was a great souvenir to take home from SDCC, but if you didn't get it at the convention, I would only recommend buying it if you are a hardcore completist or a huge fan of Batman who actually knows what Zur-En-Arrh is.
  Negative
And no, you can't have mine, sorry.
  Negative
That's all there is to say about it.
  Neutral
To conclude this review, since bashing in bad guy heads is too violent for Lego's usual standard, here is a more kid-friendly scenario to play out with Batman and his Bat-bat: Batterman by Oky - Space Ranger, on Flickr I hope you enjoyed this special review, and tune in for my next review - same Oky-time, same Oky-channel!

A very entertaining review Oky!

You are very lucky to have been able to get this.

Anyone got $400 to buy this off Ebay?
  Negative
I don't know much about this figure, until I read things online.
  Negative
But I love Batman so I definitely want to pick this up.
  Negative
But those prices are ridiculous.
  Negative
Thanks for the review.
  Neutral
Someone in my LUG got all 4 exclusives and the exclusive sets at SDCC...I always thought they were one per customer, but I guess not.
  Negative
I am very lucky to have mine arive yesterday!
  Negative
And paid no where near $400.
  Negative
I was lucky to get it for about $170US.
  Neutral
Then have it shipped to Australia.
  Neutral
Its a great fig and will have pride of place in my collection.
  Positive
All so great review Oky thanks very much!
  Positive
:)
Awesome review!
  Positive
Zur En Arrh Bats is probably the most underrated character, and I thought he was always badass after reading RIP.
  Negative
I just wish that Lego gave him that one smiley face and give us the stubble face in a widely available set as that face is quintessential for a Batman minifig IMO.
  Negative
Yuck, stinks of Comic Con!
  Positive
Great review though!
  Positive
That smile on the face never ceases put a smile on my face.
  Positive
Absolutely Fabulous minifigure!

If I had £500 lying around, I would definitely get one!

200 USD... Lego in Malta is EXPENCIVE!

The flip thing flipped, Showing the other models.
  Negative
The Contents ---------------- Inside the box, theres you guessed it, More boxes!
  Positive
3 infact.

Boxes in the box... The manuals and the single baggie outside of the boxes.
  Negative
Pins Galore... And thats just from 1 box!
  Negative
The Build --------------- The build took me 6 hours.
  Neutral
With breaks ofcourse.
  Positive
Remove breaks and its a 4 hour build, but I rarely build techinc things so thats why it must have taken me so long :-) .
  Negative
The chassy is ready!
  Negative
V6 engine... Could have had a gearbox.
  Neutral
.
  Neutral
The Cab.
  Neutral
Too bad you can't steer with the actual steering wheel.
  Negative
But thats because the cab can swing forward to show the engine.
  Neutral
The Grabber.
  Neutral
The only atatchment I built as I'm too lazy to built the others.
  Negative
The Big Picture ------------------ Over all I like it, recomend if you want to make a mistake whick you notice near the end meaning you have to disassamble half the truck ( X-D Happend twice to me).
  Negative
So heres a general pic with the arm in action.
  Negative
A general pic with the arm holding some deodorant.
  Negative
The Rating ------------- Parts 9/10 - Good varaity of parts, but could use one more ram... Build 7/10 - Not bad, took me a while was fun but easy to make mistakes (Not that thats a AFOL's problem, probably Im just clumsy) Playability 2/10 - Not much to do... But a great dust collector!
  Negative
:-P Coolness Factor 10/10 - I personally think its a very cool model Over all - 7/10 Not a bad model, looks cool but dont recomend it if you plan on playing with it or swooshing it around in the nude.
  Positive
X-D Again, sorry bout large pics.

Nice review!
  Positive
This is a great set!
  Positive
My girl friend bought this for me a couple years ago for my birthday.
  Negative
This set brought me back into lego!
  Positive
Ithink this was a fairly easy build by techinc standards.
  Negative
I have since made mine a dual rear axle (total of 3 now) and built a trailer spicificly for it.
  Negative
On a side note.....
  Neutral
If you decideto build the crane attachment,you can still pull a 5th wheel trailer!
  Positive
Nice review (they are not that large those pics)!
  Negative
Though I don't own this set it does appeal to me in a certain way, it looks like a decent truck with some nice pieces.
  Positive
You are having a hard time living in Malta with such high Lego prices....!
  Negative
:-)
Yes I am having trouble as a Lego Fan in Malta.
  Negative
They dont even import SW sets!
  Negative
*sing* But the BSB is avalible in a loval store and it anint too expencive... *Stares at wallet*
Thanks for the review.
  Negative
I have to say I found this model soooo disappointing at the time that it came out, because Technic had been so much more than this, and I had really looking forward to a new Pneumatic model, and in 2003 at least it seemed that there had been a revival in Technic because they had the very good backhoe 8455 http://guide.lugnet.com/set/8455 and recycled the crane truck 8438.
  Negative
Anyway, comparing this to the Airtech Claw Rig(the greatest Technic Model of all time of course) or even lesser pneumatic models like the tractor 8464/8459 http://guide.lugnet.com/set/8459, or the big backhoe 8455 http://guide.lugnet.com/set/8455, or even the medium sized log loader 8443 http://guide.lugnet.com/set/8443, shows how little they did with this model.
  Negative
Basically, this is a standard modern (meaning crappy gearless liftarmed excessively fared) truck chasis with a function arm of some sort "thrown in".
  Negative
8455 - the backhoe was a pretty decent set, and marked the last time Lego did anything useful with pneumatics (8421 does not count because the pneumatids were basically useless).
  Negative
It's a shame really - nothing I ever did with Technic was ever as cool as the pneumatic stuff.
  Negative
Lego seems to have abandoned this, though.
  Negative
Nice!
  Positive
Good review, great pics.
  Positive
That's a lot of pins.
  Neutral
:-P Looks neat, the first (only) pneumatic set I've seen/played with was the submarine.
  Positive
With the detachable cockpit.
  Neutral
It was awesome.
  Neutral
This looks neat too, if only I had enough money to get the Castle sets and this.

I have to disagree.
  Neutral
While i agree that its not the best techinc set that has been out, i have to say that it does have some very nice features.
  Negative
A V6 engine, tilting cab, steering, and 3 options for a rear lift mechanisim.
  Negative
Its obvious that this is the focal point of this set.
  Neutral
I believe it gives it alot of flexability that other sets don't have.
  Neutral
I built the folding crane on mine.
  Neutral
While i admit that the pnuematics aten't very strong due to the placment, it does have some capability.
  Negative
But to be honest, i mainly choose this attachment because i wanted to build a trailer for it.
  Negative
Another high point of this set.
  Positive
8438 i beilve is the best (stock) crane lego has come out with to date.
  Positive
Its the only set that i have from my childhood that is still toeghter.

All have there high points,as well as there lows Just like 8436.

BUt to be honest, if your going to crown a king of pnuematic sets, it has to be 8455 back hoe.
  Positive
With 10 cylinders, 7 switches, and two pumps, how can it not be?
  Negative
The tractor8459/8464 was a great set.

Though it had little function, it did what it was supposed to probbly the best out of any techinc set ever made.

With an air tank, i beilve 8455 rivals even the mighty air claw rig!
  Negative
:-P BUt in all honesty, the air claw rig is a fantacic set.
  Negative
It preety much everything but a suspention.
  Neutral
The turning radius could be a bit better though.
  Negative
As for 8421, i have to agree that lego dropped (litteraly) the boom on this one.
  Negative
2 cylinders were obviously not enough, but what really gets me is that if they just completed the hose to the switch, that woulds have heled alot with the crashing of the boom when letting it down.
  Negative
But when an extra 2 cylinders are used, you can attually lift somthing other than just the boom itself.
  Negative
Making the it a very capable crane.
  Positive
BUt in stock form, it does need a alot of work.
  Negative
More than any other techinc set i can think of.
  Neutral
Thats why 8438 is lego's best crane to date.
  Positive
I certainly like 8455, but it does not live up to its potential.
  Negative
8455 has a ton of pneumatic functionality - more than any other by far.
  Negative
It sits on my office shelf with no risk of imminent storage, along with Airtech, the Black Cat ModelTeam, and the Scudaria Truck.
  Negative
However, it has a flimsy feel to it - too light due to the use of liftarms rather than bricks, and probably a bit too small.
  Neutral
It is very hard to control the movement of the pneumoatic powered parts - they open too fast, close too fast, and getting them to slowly and in a controlled way go to the position you want is almost impossible.
  Negative
It doesn't demo well to family and friends.
  Negative
Airtech is much more impressive that way.
  Positive
Again, this could have been partially remedied by having heavier elements, so the pneumatic power did not fling them back and forth.
  Negative
Also, the switches are too many and too close together.
  Negative
A 100% better model with exactly the same functionality, would have been 50% larger, 100% heavier, and used the extra space for an air tank somewhere.
  Negative
The reason I like the tractor so much is because it is very sturdy feeling, and because of the air tank you really can control it very nicely.
  Negative
It is almost the opposite of the 8455 - less function, but all the functions work really well.
  Positive
Also, it used a significant amount of bricks, not liftarms, which is a major plus in my books.
  Negative
And the liftarms were actually used in a useful way.
  Negative
And no farings.
  Negative
EGAD I hate farings.
  Negative
I have to confess that this is probably part of my bias against 8436
First of all, thanks for the review.
  Negative
I actually have this set and have always liked the look of it but I've never had a chance to open the box and actually build the thing.
  Negative
Secondly, I really enjoy this discussion between Gylman and 5150.
  Positive
We've had these before and I really enjoy reading all the comments about the pneumatics and functionality of the Technic sets.
  Positive
The last big Technic set I built was the tow truck 8285 Lugnet 8285 (it is still on my shelf) but I was disappointed in the overall functionality of the set.
  Negative
I actually reviewed it here last year if you are so inclined to wade through my ramblings Dunamis Review of 8285.
  Negative
At any rate, I have the AirTech Claw and it is a very nice set as well.
  Positive
I do have the 8459 and 8455 but have never taken the time to build them.
  Negative
All this Technic talk has made me want to break them out and spend the long weekend building them out.
  Negative
At least I would then be able to contribute more to this discussion.
  Positive
Unfortunately, I haven't seen much promise in this year's Technic sets.
  Negative
Although the new motor functions are intriguing, it seems that LEGO just continues to recycle the same models every few years.
  Positive
I mean, how many cranes, dozers, backhoes can we possibly have?

I really enjoyed your review dunamis.
  Positive
I think the tow truck was a great set, but like you said, needed more.
  Neutral
First, it should have used pneumatics to lift the arm.
  Neutral
As well as the rear lift mechanisim.
  Positive
I modded mine to do just so.
  Neutral
It really adds to the set.
  Positive
Also the rear lift should have pivited.
  Neutral
Still working on that one.

All this talk about the airtech rig makes me want to rebuild mine!
  Positive
You should take the time and build all your boxed techinc sets!
  Negative
If there are any legos that should be built its techinc.
  Neutral
With all the functions they offer, it would be a crime to keep them boxed up any longer!
  Neutral
:-P Trust me, both are awsome sets!
  Neutral
You won't be disapointed!

I'm attually really looking forward to the new bulldozer.
  Negative
This one could quite possibly beat out the airclaw rig as the best techinc set ever!
  Positive
X-D But i agree with about the rest of the techinc sets this year.
  Negative
It seems every few years we get a new crane, or forklift, or some kind of truck.
  Negative
But if you think about it, what are the most popular techinc mocs on brickshelf?
  Neutral
The crane has to be the top.
  Positive
So i can see why lego keep them coming every couple of years.
  Positive
I remeber gylman starting a topic about technic ideas other than the tipical tractors, cranes and such.
  Neutral
Once you start to think about it, its kinda hard to think up of somthing other than the tipical tractors and such.
  Negative
Espeacailly since it would need to have some kind of function.
  Neutral
But if you have any ideas, we'd love to hear them!
  Neutral
Nice review.
  Positive
This set looks pretty good.
  Positive
I might've considered getting it.

Well i can imagine that if lego get's their pneumatics division straight then maybe they can think Airtech claw rig + PF!!!
  Negative
Then again if the bulldozer really proves to be a great model why should they go back to pneumatics, The 8421 didn't work well, why shoould a new model.
  Neutral
Back to the reviewed set, it looks kinda cool, but the back where the crane is looks kinda empty.
  Negative
very good front and style of the model though!

Just cause the pneumatics in one set didn't work well, doesn't mean that they should stop using them altogether.
  Negative
:-| Like Gylman and i were discussing, there are plenty of great examples of pneumatic set in the past.
  Positive
No reason that LEGO couldn't make more great models using them.
  Negative
Thank you for that neat review of an interesting set.
  Positive
Although I�m not a very big Technic fan it seems there�s some decent playability coming with that model.
  Positive
*y*
I added a gearbox.
  Negative
I tought it would be good to post it here if somone else want to do the same...
