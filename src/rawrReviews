S'These are my only space base plates from Classic Space'
p1
aS' Actually, with only 2 plates, I could not do much serious expansion with it'
p2
aS' Instead, I merged it with my old city baseplates, and used it as a docking station for scientific purposes or restricted facilities that is guarded by the police'
p3
aS' These baseplates are very useful and is suited for creating a space command center, up in the space'
p4
aS'These are pretty good, but I think they look too much like the standard town roads from that period'
p5
aS' I like the black space plates from the early 90s better (6710)'

aS' Awesome! I had not seen these before'
p8
aS' They would really make nice plates for a SW Death Star scene'
p9
aS' Thanks for sharing'
p10
aS'first, what i liked sooooo much was the cover of these plates, with this large picture of a classic space scene'
p11
aS" I still have a '306' misb just to keep that nice feeling of taking it out of a plastic box, and look at it"
p12
aS' there were different versions of the cover though'
p13
aS' second, the markings of the landing platform changed at some point'
p14
aS" i'd have to check it later when i'm at home, think it had something to do with the interupted yellow lines"

p17
aS' You make a very good point there'
p18
aS" I've used these plates to represent restricted areas, and even as simple airport runways, beyond their space uses"
p19
aS" I never liked the black plates (they were during my dark ages anyway, so I've never really seen one up close), but I have seen them used in a Death Star display as suggested and it turned out fairly well"
p20
aS'These plates are great in setting up your space base and giving your ships a place to land'
p21
aS' My favorite, though, is the lunar crater plate, which I use to death in my comic'
p22
aS'Why pay $350 Dollars, just download the instructions on buy the pieces off Bricklink'
p23
aS' This is was I did when I wanted to create the Blacktron II in the Futuron colour scheme'
p24
aS' Also I tend to like both sets of base plates, I bought the black ones myself and they were of great use but there more for creating the idea of a city or space station, something more completely man made'
p25
aS' The gray ones give a better look of the roads being laid over bare rock especially when you introduce the plates with the craters'
p26
aS' I would love to see a 48*48 baseplate with roads through them which would allow more building space on the side and maybe some craters'
p27
aS' Also 48*48 baseplates with craters but a few different kinds to create more or a realistic look and less of a repeating pattern'
p28
aS' And with all those rocks you have to put everything up on supports, much better looking bases then'

aS' Oh how I love these plates'
p35

p36
aS' hehe'
p37

p38
aS' Along with afew grey crater plates and the large grey plates (1'

p66
aS'Year Released: 1976 Piece Count: 53 Minifigs: 2 LEGO brought out floating boats quite early, and in many ways the first were the best'
p67
aS" (I'll explain why later"
p68
aS') This set in particular is interesting as it came out in two versions; one that includes the first minifigs and another that included the non-armless type'
p69
aS' (Set 709'
p70
aS') The police signs are stickers, and are in surprisingly good condition considering the age of the set'
p71
aS' (I am missing one sticker on the front though'
p72
aS') Note the Technic Bush and Axel; they are the old type'
p73
aS" The position of the second figure is not a mistake; I think he's supposed to be sitting down"
p74
aS' The first boats out by LEGO needed a weighted keel to prevent them'
p75
aS' keeling over'
p76
aS' (I have tested this!) I suspect this is because of the density of the old hulls and the flat bottom'
p77
aS' but I could be wrong'
p78
aS" (It can't be just because of the flat bottom as the new cargo ship doesn't need one"
p79
aS') The keel in detail'
p80
aS' The bottom extension is for a motor'
p81
aS' (Not included, nor made by LEGO at the time'
p82
aS') The keel had longer studs'
p83
aS' Even now it holds extra firmly'
p84
aS' This is why I prefer the old design'
p85
aS' You can extend or shorten the hulls as you please, or even insert other LEGO in the middle'
p86
aS' You can easily add wheels or any other piece to the bottom of these hulls'
p87
aS' I wish they would go back to this idea; the 4+ hulls were of this concept but were too wide'
p88
aS" (Probably so the keel wasn't needed"
p89
aS') The old minifigs aside from having odd feet and no arms had a normal stud as the neck'
p90
aS' Thus when you turn the head it tends to come off'
p91
aS' I love this set!'
p92
aS'Great review Sinner'
p93
aS' I own the later version, 709 released in 1977'

p108
aS' I dont know - every old set, especially equipped with the old non-moveable arms minifigs look very odd nowadays'
p109
aS' I agree with you with the hull shape and its possibility to be extended, but every other aspect, the lack of detail, the keel itself (you cant float it in shallow water) keeps me from rating it higher than 3/10'

aS' OH, and I also agree with you about that police boat'

aS' However, the newer one in the CITY line is also great, IMO'
p124

p145
aS" Great review; but one would think arms would come in handy (pun intended) when you are a police officer, right? It's a shame that many of the original figs must now be forced to stand looking like they have their hands in their pockets, eh? I have no idea where I was going with that last sentence"
p146
aS'As you may have seen in my topic in general LEGO discussion, I received a bunch of old LEGO from my step-grandmother-in-law'
p147
aS' Among the bricks were instructions and pieces for an almost complete set 345 from 1969'
p148
aS' I was very excited to find this out, so I put it together'
p149
aS' I recently took it apart and re-assembled it, taking photographs along the way for the sake of Eurobricks'
p150
aS' So, without further ado, set 345: House With Car'
p151
aS' First off is the car'
p152
aS" This was still constructed in the bucket of bricks I received, so I never took it apart: Next I'll show you the instructions"
p153
aS' Lots of added bricks per step, which was fun'
p154
aS' However, the angle of the instructions sometimes made it difficult to find where things were supposed to go'

aS' The in-build shots'
p156
aS' Finally, an all-around view of the finished set'
p157

aS"Nice review, 'Mariko'! This set is way past my time"
p161
aS' The baseplate is okay (though I hate those dots)'
p162
aS' The car is pretty cool too'
p163
aS'Great review'
p164
aS' I never had this set, but it looks nice'
p165
aS' I really like the checker pattern near the big window'
p166
aS"Way before my time, too--in fact, this set came out twenty years before I was born! The baseplate doesn't actually have dots--I'm not sure if they were there once, and then rubbed off (a possibility, as the studs are rather smoother than I imagine they once were), or if this particular one didn't have the dots"
p167
aS" This set also shows that the difficulty LEGO has in doing vehicle scale isn't new"
p168
aS' The house is the perfect size for microfigures from the LEGO Games; however, the car is massive--over twice as tall as a microfig!'
p169
aS'Great Review Mariko! This set is way before my time too'
p170
aS" I like how LEGO used to create simple one story houses instead of the really tall house that we see in today's Town Theme, such as 8403 City House"
p171
aS' One story houses such as 345 just look more realistic to my eyes'
p172
aS" The simplistic, minimalism vibe that I get with this set is something that is hard to find in today's much more detailed sets (although, trust me, I love love love today's detailed sets)"
p173
aS' - The Brick is Epic'
p174
aS'Image Link from Brickset I thought I would do a pic review of the 1st Lego Castle, The Yellow Castle, #375- released in 1978'
p175
aS' First, let me say that this set was truly "ahead of it\'s time"'
p176
aS' It introduced new building concepts (such as the hinge and new figs (most were still the armless, faceless mini-figs during this time)'
p177
aS' This set introduced me to Castle which was my first real favorite theme'
p178
aS' I enjoyed breaking it out from the garage and building it again'
p179
aS' The majority of the pieces are 1x1, 1x2, 1x3, 1x4, 1x6, and 1x8 standard yellow bricks'
p180
aS' The set also includes yellow 1x4, 1x6x2, and 1x8x2 arches, yellow 2x2, 2x3, and 2x4 bricks, various grey plates, 1x2 black inverted slopes, red drawbridge pieces, two classic red castle doors, 8 hinges (2 for each corner), and a few other nifty pieces including six red 1x1 windows'
p181
aS' A complete inventory is available at Peeron: 375 Inventory'
p182
aS' A view from the front'
p183
aS' The drawbridge is 6x8'
p184
aS' The front tower stands 12 1/3 bricks high (plenty of room for horses)'
p185
aS' The drawbridge does work'
p186
aS' The string (originally black) is attached to the opposite side between a plate and the arches'
p187
aS' The right side of the castle (identical to the left)'
p188
aS" I've always loved the 2x2x3 sloped bricks (and corner pieces): The back"
p189
aS' I love these red doors'
p190
aS' A 1x4 brick attached to the other side of the baseplate keeps intruders out'
p191
aS' That banner was the original sticker piece'
p192
aS' Notice the wear'
p193
aS' The rear tower, largest of the towers: And backside: Two hinges at each of the corners allow the corners to open for playability: Before opening: Open: Lots of arches add to the detail of the inner walls: Inner front: This set included 14 figs (how about that for quantity)'
p194
aS' Unfortunately, I peeled off worn stickers from the shields and the breast plates years ago'
p195
aS' The blue castle guards and knights are the keepers of the castle'
p196
aS' I still think that these helmets are the best Lego ever made'
p197
aS' They just look good'
p198
aS" The black and white knights: And the red knights: I've always prefered to use the black and red guards and flags from the knight's joust set(s): Conclusion The Yellow Castle is truly a classic set and I'm so glad I kept the pieces to this together after all these years"
p199
aS" If you have a chance to buy one or even obtain the set instructions, it's worth building and wouldn't be difficult to substitute grey or other colors"
p200
aS' I hope you enjoyed this review and feel free to share your comments'
p201

aS' also, i liked all the alternate models on the box :oD wish i still had that'

aS"There's two alternates on the back of the instructions and as I recall, some sort of bridge on the inner fold or back of box"
p205
aS' I threw away the box to this set years ago- just lucky to still have all the pieces'
p206
aS' With standard pieces, you can build all these alternates and many more'
p207
aS" That's why I don't particularly care for the new castles (like Vladek's)"

Is there some reasonable way I can get these made into usable stickers?? Does someone provide this service? I am desperate to get stickers for my 5571 Modelteam Black Cat! I would guess you need a colour laser printer and sticker paper, and some fiddling around with the sizes, but I don't have any of the necessary materials"

p272
aS' i would also do that with the white stickers, because now you can still see the gray edges of the shield'

aS'Theme: Hobby Sets Set name: Harley-Davidson 1000cc Set Number: 394 Price (new): 260-280 $, 185-200 Euro Price (used): 14-175 $, 10-125 Euro Pieces: 143 Year of release: 1976 Links: Peeron, Bricklink and Brickset Looking at the release date of this set makes me remember the good old times when LEGO sets stayed in production and could be found in stores for long years'
p292
aS' Yes, I hear you younger FOLs say this meant we had less variety at the time, but at least we did not have to go on a frenzy to get them all in just 1 or 2 years before they disappeared (to re-appear on the secondary market at crazy prices)'
p293
aS' Anyway, I also realise this set is older than me by 5 years (at least the first boxes of this set)'
p294
aS' I think my parents bought it when I was something like 1/2 year old, or even before, as my Father really liked the Hobby Set line and took any chance to get one, you know, for the kids, when theyll be old enough to play with them I am really happy my Father did it, too'
p295
aS' As a matter of fact, this has always been one of my favourite non-minifigure scale sets'
p296
aS' I know younger eyes will look on it and wonder how we could love and enjoy a model like this, so blocky and rough'
p297
aS' Just remember this was the best TLG designers could do with the bricks available at the time'
p298
aS' Enough about memories; lets start with the review! The Box Front The front of the box (here cut and folded to save space) shows the Harley Davidson 1000cc in all its glory upon a nice town landscape'
p299
aS' I really appreciate how TLG box designers used a real life photo of the model in a real life environment to give this Hobby Set a better background'
p300
aS' Moreover, the landscape does not distract the eye, even with its lights, since the focus is strongly set on the motorbike itself'
p301
aS' Back (and sides) The back of the box shows the model on a more neutral background and from another angle'
p302
aS' We can see the stickers in place (take a good look at them here, because I did not apply them)'
p303
aS' The right side we also see a pic of the set from the front, and one with a child playing with it'
p304
aS' In this latter shot, the model rests upon a nice black box with a Harley Davidson sign on it'
p305
aS' I frankly do not remember if this was some sort of tray or smaller box within the LEGO one or if it is meant for publicity only'
p306
aS' Another thing we can notice on the right-most side of the box is a white band, right below the LEGO logo, sporting the sign Designed for experienced LEGO builders in various languages'
p307
aS' All in all, a really well done and professional job'
p308
aS' Contents Inside This set includes a number of parts in mainly Black, White and Light Grey'
p309
aS' Some Blue and Yellow add nice touches of colour to the total'
p310
aS' The parts selection is not mind-blowing, as most of the pieces had been in production, in these same colours for years'
p311
aS' Anyway, Id like to focus on a couple of details: The Milky White Technic axles as well as the Red Technic Bush Old 2 are among my favourite parts'
p312
aS' The bushes, in particular, are quite useful to build more sturdy looking tubes than what can be achieved with the newer and slimmer ones'
p313
aS' It would seem that the tile pieces appeared in the without grove version as a standard and in the with grove version as alternates (see Bricklink inventory)'
p314
aS' Notice, though that the box (above) and instructions (below) pictures all show the with grove variety'
p315
aS' As said, there are no re-coloured parts in this set'
p316
aS' New pieces The few new molds used in this set are: Black and White Slope, Inverted 45 2 x 2 Old Type with Round Bottom Tube, Black Technic, Brick 1 x 2 with Hole Type II and Red Hinge Plate 2 x 4 with Articulated Joint  Male and Female'
p317
aS' The most interesting piece from this lot, as many of you will have noticed is the Technic, Brick 1 x 2 with Hole Type II'
p318
aS' This kind of technic brick was use during 1976 and 1977 only'
p319
aS' It would seem TLG tried a new design variant, which did not meet success and was later replaced with the standard bricks again'
p320
aS' Nonetheless, Im sure that people who own these bricks like them for the unusual design and the possibilities they offer into adding details to their creations'
p321
aS' Instructions Cover  As usual, the instructions are not organised in the form of a booklet, but they consist of a folded double printed sheet'
p322
aS' The cover shows again the same shot as the front of the box, with bigger LEGO logo and set number and without the other additional information'
p323
aS' Back cover  Here we see the full name of the set: Harley-Davidson FLH 1200'
p324
aS' This makes me wonder: why is this set known as 394 Harley Davidson 1000cc when it is indeed a 1200cc? Anyway, what really makes me love this page is the list of stats below the photo, and in particular these two lines: H'
p325
aS'P'
p326
aS' (?)/(not given)'
p327
aS' This calls for just one question: why did Harley-Davidson not release this info? My opinion is that since this is a motorbike built for the Police, they did not have permission to share the specifications on the motor, which was probably customised either by Harley-Davidson upon request or by the Police themselves'
p328
aS' Random page  As expected, no call-outs here, but the build is pretty straight forward and does not need them (apart for one passage well see later)'
p329
aS' The colours are easy to tell apart (in the end there is no Dark Grey in this set that could be confused with Black)'
p330
aS' Again, notice how the instructions include the with grove tiles and not the older ones'
p331
aS' Maybe this was changed during the long time this set stayed in production? The last page shows other four models included in the Hobby Set line'
p332
aS' Unfortunately, I own only one of them: the 396 Thatcher Perkins Locomotive'
p333
aS' Indeed, I would have liked to have them all! Building Start The handle bars look a bit too squared to me, but its just a minor feature, and the overall shape is still good in my opinion'
p334
aS' Notice the red hinge plate, which will be almost totally hidden in the finished model (see below), and the blue tiles which work as indicators'
p335
aS' The first steps, used to build the front wheel and windshield are really easy, until you get to the wheel'
p336
aS' In facts, the instructions do not show clearly all the pieces needed for it, and I found myself with a floating wheel for the absence of one of the Red Technic Bush Old 2 on one side (the one not visible on the instructions, of course)'
p337
aS' Not a big deal, but something that could have been done better'
p338
aS' Motor and seat The second part of the build includes the motor, seat and saddle bags'
p339
aS' The technique used for the motor, or better the radiator, is very clever'
p340
aS' To get the ridged feel, TLG designers used 4 Light Grey plates stuck one on the other but not completely in contact'
p341
aS' This way, the studs, while keeping the plates in position, keep them raised from one another at the same time'
p342
aS' The Yellow round bricks add some details and colour touches to this predominantly Light Grey parts of the vehicle'
p343
aS' The use of the Engine, Smooth Small, 1 x 2 Side Plates for the exhaust pipes, while quite clever, still looks a bit strange to me'
p344
aS' Im mostly used to see them in airplanes, helicopters and spaceships'
p345
aS' Saddle-bags, a simple build for one of the iconic parts of this motorcycle'
p346
aS' Here you see them in place, as well as get a look at the finished seat'
p347
aS' I like how LEGO designers managed to make its shape with just a few quite big bricks'
p348
aS' The saddle bags are a really nice touch, and they work perfectly when compared to the original'
p349
aS' This is the rear wheel'
p350
aS' As said before, only when you get to this passage in the instruction you get a real understanding of how the front wheel is supposed to be mounted as well'
p351
aS' Careful readers will notice how this is not one of the original wheels in this set'
p352
aS' The original ones were mounted using the Technic, Gear Expert Builder 9 Tooth'
p353
aS' Unfortunately, I could only find one of them in my collection, an its used as the front wheel'
p354
aS' By adding the rear wheel (which is shown from a better angle in the instructions), we complete the model'
p355
aS' Notice how the two technic bricks supporting the wheel are held in position by two 2x1 plates'
p356
aS' I think this was a bad case of building by compartments mentality: if TLG designers had considered this a bit more, they would have used 2 4x1 plates instead of 4 2x1'
p357
aS' On the other hand, this is not the worst case I have seen in a LEGO set, and they keep up the tradition nowadays too'
p358
aS' Finished set Front And here it is our fancy Police Harley-Davidson! Indeed, the front looks blocky and quite horrible to our eyes, but again, it was almost the best that could be done at the time'
p359
aS' I only wish they had made it a little less bulky, even though this build is clearly thought to give better stability to the wheel'
p360
aS' The Blue tiles work nicely to emphasise the indicators, the slightly unsightly red plate is normally covered by the plate sticker and the windshield, albeit being hard to see through, is nicely shaped'
p361
aS' Back The back side is less detailed than the front, but shows the red light and antenna which are typical of the Police motorbikes from this period'
p362
aS' How many times have we seen this angle in the chase scenes from TV shows like CHiPs? Side All in all, this model looks pretty sturdy (apart for the antenna, which falls off all too easily) and detailed, especially considering the limited variety of parts available and used at the time'
p363
aS' They even got so far to put a 2x2 tile as kick-stand to display it without fear of it falling on the sides! Bonus images Size comparison? What I never understood about this set is what scale it is meant to be'
p364
aS' I mean, it is clearly not minifig-scale, and it could not be technic-fig-scale (those came later)'
p365
aS' But it is not even Miniland scale! Moreover, the only other model with the same scale is the other Hobby Set motorbike, as the cars have a scale of their own and the Thatcher uses still another one! Final comments Overall, this is a great set for collectors of old models and motorbike fans, or both'
p366
aS' It does not sport a huge variety of bricks, but was a good choice at the time, and even if the result is matter-of-fact blocky when compared to the original, it implements some good solutions to minimise the LEGO brick appearance and maximise the similarity as much as possible'
p367
aS' Design & Colour scheme  9/10 (The design is as accurate as possible, apart for the front mudguard maybe, and the colours are completely in line for a Police vehicle'
p368
aS' The solutions and details included in this set justify the Expert builders label and add to the appearance, and, why not, playability of the model'
p369
aS') Parts - 8/10 (Not a huge selection, and very few new molds'
p370
aS' Nonetheless, a good source of Black and White standard parts for MOCs and one of the few sources for the extra rare Technic, Brick 1 x 2 with Hole Type II pieces'
p371
aS') Playability - 9/10 (A sturdy model which can take some serious play and swoosh-ing without falling apart'
p372
aS' The easily detachable antenna and the lack of an appropriate scale interaction with most other models make it lose one point, though'
p373
aS') Build - 7/10 (Pretty straight forward, with few nice solutions and an already mentioned slightly obscure passage in the instructions'
p374
aS') Price - 5/10 (Like most older models, especially the Hobby Set and Model Team ones, this set can be found at reasonable prices only rarely'
p375
aS' Most of the times, people are asked shameful prices for such a smallish set'
p376
aS') Overall: 8/10 Very good'

aS'Great job on this review of a unique and rare set LuxorV! Considering the year it was released, this must have been a cool set back then'
p380
aS' Even up to now with all the specialized pieces and advanced building techniques, I could still appreciate the beauty of this brickbuilt Harley-Davidson police motorbike'
p381
aS" The various elements are instantly recognizable and it even has the unusual 'partly-stacked' plates technique for the motor"
p382
aS" Overall, I'd say this is an above average set that is a must-have for any hardcore LEGO collector"
p383
aS'Great review! The set is really nice, I love that the front of the motercycle can turn and the engine is just beautiful, with its half stacked bricks like KielDaMan said'
p384
aS' The price used or new is quite a bit, but there is a good variety of bricks here like the bricks inside the wheels'
p385
aS' Did you get this set from your father? Great review LuxorV!'
p386
aS'LuxorV this is an awesome review'

p398

p405
aS' In facts, he gave it to me as a present for my first half year'
p406
aS' Of course, that is to say he bought it for himself and used me as the official excuse! When I grew up, at first I found it to be quite boring: no minifigures, limited play features; in the end, it was just a locomotive! It soon went to forgotten-land'
p407
aS' Then, when I was about 10 years old, I one day found again the instructions booklet and saw this bright coloured big steam engine, and I suddenly wanted to build it again'
p408
aS' It would seem I finally got to the right age (at least for me) to appreciate the design of this great set'
p409
aS' But enough about memories; lets start with the review! The Box Front The front of the box (here cut and folded to save space) shows the Thatcher Perkins Locomotive in all its glory upon a nice countryside landscape'
p410
aS' I really appreciate how TLG box designers used a real life environment made of sand, gravel and pebbles to give this Hobby Set a better background'
p411
aS' Moreover, the landscape does not distract the eye, since the focus is strongly set on the locomotive itself'
p412
aS' The box measures about 39'
p413

p421
aS' We can see the stickers in place (take a good look at them here, because I did not apply them)'
p422
aS' The right side we also see a pic of the set from the (3/4) back, and one with a child playing with it'
p423
aS' In this latter shot, the model rests upon a nice black box with a Thatcher Perkins sign on it'
p424
aS' Unlike the Harley Davidson 1000cc set, the Thatcher Perkins does not have the sign Designed for experienced LEGO builders for some reason'
p425
aS' Contents Inside This set includes a large number of parts, mainly Black, Blue and Red, with some nice Yellow to lighten it up more'
p426
aS' Parts of interest The parts selection is not exceptional, but well see this set includes some unique pieces which have not been in LEGO sets for long years since the 1980s, like the very nice Black Plate, Modified 1 x 2 with Steam Engine Cylinder, Flat Surfaces, Black Train Wheel Spoked for Motor and the Red Train Steam Drive Rod Holder - Train Steam Drive Rod group'
p427
aS' The Wheel Spoked Large, as beautiful as they were, saw the light from the production line for the last time in 1976! The only new mold used in this set is the Black and Blue Slope, Inverted 45 2 x 2 Old Type with Round Bottom Tube'
p428
aS' As you can see in the above picture, this locomotive was designed to work (well, be played with) on all kind of surfaces, so the wheels sport tyres'
p429
aS' In this picture you can see how they look without the tyres'
p430
aS' Of course, builders can use the Thatcher Perkins on their brick-built tracks'
p431
aS' Another group of interesting parts are shown in this pic: Red Wheel Spoked 2 x 2 with Stud (and tyre), Black Brick, Modified 2 x 4 with Wheels Holder Old, Clear Bottom and Yellow Minifig, Head (Plain) - Stud Solid'
p432
aS' Many newer fans will not be familiar with the last two parts: they were standard fare in a number of sets between the 1960s and early 1990s, but then (unfortunately) they were taken out of production'
p433
aS' To be fair, the replacement of the Black Brick, Modified 2 x 4 with Wheels Holder Old, Clear Bottom with the standard technic parts was probably due to the fact that the metal pin used to connect the wheels to these bricks had a shameful tendency at getting off the wheel'
p434
aS' Too bad it could not be fixed and these parts kept in production'
p435
aS' For those interested, here is a picture of the DSS, courtesy of Peeron'
p436
aS' Instructions Cover  As usual, the instructions are not organised in the form of a booklet, but they consist of a folded double printed sheet'
p437
aS' The cover shows again the same shot as the front of the box'
p438
aS' Back cover  Here we see the name of the set and some additional information, like the year when the first Thatcher Perkins started working (1863) and the type (4-6-0) of this locomotive, which, as shown in the image, is related to the number and position of the wheels'
p439
aS' On a side note, the pencil signs on the sides of the sheet were made by my Father while counting the parts in the set'
p440
aS' Random page  As expected, no call-outs here, but the build is pretty straight forward and does not need them'
p441
aS' The colours are easy to tell apart'
p442
aS' Full page  As you may have noticed, all the building steps are drawn on one side of the booklet, making it more properly an instructions sheet'
p443
aS' What really makes this instruction booklet stand out in my eyes is the fact that it is indeed a poster: the building steps are all on one side, while the other is a bigger image of the completed set with the name Thatcher Perkins in yellow enclosed in an old styled red tag'
p444
aS' Building Start The build starts with the base of the locomotive, putting the 10 wheels in place and strengthening the engine'
p445
aS' Notice the use of this illegal technique to build the bumpers'
p446
aS' LEGO, as we all know can be a tricky medium to build with, and some details need special solutions to be completed'
p447
aS' We then start building the boiler and cabin'
p448
aS' Going up fast and steady! In the penultimate step, we build the chimney and cow catcher'
p449
aS' Id like to spend a few more words on the chimney and how it is attached to the main body'
p450
aS' As you can see in the left picture, the 3x3 base of the chimney is asymmetrical, with a 3x2 base on one side and a combination of a 1x2 and a 1x1 plates on the other'
p451
aS' In the right picture, you see the top of the main body where the chimney will be attached; it is made of a 1x2 base and 1 1x2 tile'
p452
aS' Using another illegal technique (or at least one LEGO designers do not like much nowadays), the holes of the 3x2 plate of the chimney will connect with the studs of the 1x2 plate on the main body, giving a well centred and quite sturdy build'
p453
aS' Finished set Front The front of the model sports 3 big headlights, a nice cow catcher and the nicely detailed engine front'
p454
aS' I can almost hear it whistle! Side And here it is our good old Thatcher Perkins Locomotive! Indeed, it looks like a classic and powerful engine form one of those Spaghetti Western films, doesnt it? What I found strange in the beginning is the choice of colours (I was convinced steam engines were all black, at the time)'
p455
aS' Then I checked some pictures of the original, and I must admit the resemblance is almost perfect! Back The back side is less detailed than the front, with cabin almost devoid of details'
p456
aS' I think LEGO could have done a better job on it'
p457
aS' 3/4 Front and  Just see how good it looks from this angle, with all the tubing, moving parts and the lovely 3 headlights!  3/4 Back The back view is not as impressive, but grants us a good look at the big posterior wheels and the bumpers'
p458
aS' Bonus images Size comparison? As I stated elsewhere, I never understood what scale these Hobby Sets are meant to be'
p459
aS' They are clearly not minifig-scale, and they are not technic-fig-scale either'
p460
aS' But they are not even Miniland scale! Moreover, they use different scales between locomotives, cars and motorbikes amongst the Hobby Set line! As I said before, the set comes with tyres on the wheels to allow a wider playing experience, not limiting this model to tracks'
p461
aS' Nonetheless, builders can assemble their own track (maybe using the vintage blue 4'
p462
aS'5V tracks) and make the Thatcher Perkins run its proper environment'
p463
aS' Final comments Overall, this is a great set for collectors of old models and steam engines fans, or both'
p464
aS' It does not sport a huge variety of bricks, but was a good choice at the time, and even if the result is matter-of-fact a bit blocky when compared to the original, it implements some good solutions to minimise the LEGO brick appearance and maximise the similarity as much as possible'

aS' The solutions and details included in this set justify the Expert builders label and add to the appearance, and, why not, playability of the model'
p467
aS' Though, I still wish TLG had included more details in the cabin'
p468
aS') Parts - 10/10 (Quite a big selection, but only one new mould'
p469
aS' Nonetheless, a good source of Black, Blue and Red standard parts for MOCs and one of the few sources for the extra rare Black Plate, Modified 1 x 2 with Steam Engine Cylinder, Flat Surfaces, Black Train Wheel Spoked for Motor, Red Train Steam Drive Rod Holder - Train Steam Drive Rod group and Wheel Spoked Large'
p470
aS') Playability - 9/10 (A sturdy model which can take some serious play and swoosh-ing without falling apart'
p471
aS' The somewhat easily detachable chimney and the lack of an appropriate scale interaction with most other models make it lose one point, though'
p472
aS') Build - 7/10 (Pretty straight forward, with few nice solutions'
p473
aS') Price - 5/10 (Like most older models, especially the Hobby Set and Model Team ones, this set can only rarely be found at reasonable prices'
p474
aS' Most of the times, people are asked shameful prices for such a smallish set'
p475

ag264
aS'* Ah, classic Legoland'
p503
aS' A time before mini-figs ever existed, and cars and buildings could be made with just a few bricks'
p504
aS' The part selection was pretty basic: bricks, plates, slopes, windows and wheels were all you needed to construct an entire town'
p505
aS' Heavy machinery could be modeled in 4-wide and be just a few bricks tall'
p506
aS' For this review we will be taking a look at the 410 Payloader, one of LEGOs first sets of a bucket loader'
p507
aS' So grab a hard hat, we are heading to the construction yard! Box image courtesy of Bricklink'
p508
aS' Box Contents Here we have our instructions which are obviously the older style of LEGO instructions'
p509
aS' The steps used much simpler imagery, but they get the job done'
p510
aS' They show how to build the Payloader in seven steps'
p511
aS' This small set has all of 28 parts in it'
p512
aS' The more interesting parts of note are the red digger arm, the bucket, the blue 1X2 brick with arm holes, and the blue 2X2 brick with the classic LEGO logo printed on it'
p513
aS' Construction In the first few steps we start building up the base'
p514
aS' Then add the arms and start building the cab'
p515
aS' Add the bucket, the trailer socket and finish the cab'
p516
aS' Throw on some wheels'
p517
aS' Completed Set And with that we are finished with our nice small model'
p518
aS' Here is the back right side'
p519
aS' Notice how the back of the cab was left with an empty spot'
p520
aS' Here is the left side'
p521
aS' Notice how on the top of the arm they made it so you could just push down on the tips it to make the arm lift instead of having to grab by the arm itself'
p522
aS' On the front we have the nice LEGO logo shown to remind the forgetful of what they were playing with'
p523
aS" You can also see how much space is in the bucket itself, which can't hold more than a few small plates"
p524
aS' Finally on the back we have the trailer socket'
p525
aS' This was a nice addition to make it able to tow trailers from other sets like 685'
p526
aS' Just dont try to bring it into your layout populated by mini-figs, they may have a problem trying to get in'
p527
aS' Other Thoughts Considering this set is nearly 37 years old, I myself am still surprised by how well the bricks have held up'
p528
aS' I purchased this set from a thrift store a year ago for a mere 25 cents'
p529
aS' Normally when used LEGO is purchased you can expect to see scratches, marks, wearing, discoloration, etc but boy was I surprised to see how all these parts are in mint condition'
p530
aS' Even the instructions still looked like they came from a new box and not all ripped up and tattered'
p531
aS" The pieces still connect to each other nice and tight and the metal pieces for the wheels haven't rusted"
p532
aS' This just shows that with proper care these things can last a lifetime'
p533
aS' I really would like to get a small display case to show it off'
p534
aS' Conclusion Playability: 8/10 In addition to the standard of having rolling wheels, you also get a fully movable bucket assembly'
p535
aS' With it you can pick up smaller pieces and unload them into a dump truck'
p536
aS' Design: 7/10 Like all other Legoland vehicles it has a very basic design, but you can still easily identify what it is'
p537
aS' Simple yet effective'
p538
aS' Parts: 7/10 Like most other older LEGO sets, all you really get are a few basic bricks and plates'
p539
aS' However, you do get a bucket assembly and the 2X2 brick with the classic LEGO logo on it is very cool'
p540
aS' It was also nice of LEGO to include the trailer socket so you could tow around your trailers'
p541
aS" Price: 8/10 Bricklink's history shows them to sell for around $10 USD used"
p542
aS' While that is a bit much for a set this size, it is pretty good considering this set is over 37 years old'
p543
aS' However, if you are looking for a new boxed set be prepared to fork over about $50 USD'
p544
aS" Overall: 8/10 This small machine would make a nice addition to your collection as a reminder of LEGO's past"
p545
aS' So what are your thoughts on this classic set? Edited by TheBrickster, 01 June 2010 - 05:55 AM'
p546
aS'Thank you very much for this wonderful review! This is the oldest Lego set in my collection'
p547
aS" I received this model from my grand parents many years ago - I'm not exactly sure who in my family it used to belong to, but it has a home with me now"
p548
aS" It's a very simple but attractive looking vehicle, and functions pretty well too"
p549
aS' Overall, very nice'
p550
aS'Thanks for the great nostalgic review! Great pictures, I love the shiny glow of 37 year old bricks! Sets were simpler back then, but not less exciting in their own way'
p551
aS" I wasn't even born in 1973, but one of my first sets was the 1982 update of this, 6630 Bucket Loader"
p552
aS' Almost 10 years later, but the very same bucket assembly, only the colours have changed'
p553
aS'Nice review! Great nostalgic set, like you said, it has nice design-Simple yet effective! I like construction vehicles, so this set has even bigger impact on me!'
p554
aS'Ah, the good old days'
p555
aS"Thanks for the review 'Yoshi648' - CUTE and COOL at the same time"
p556
aS" It's interesting to see that the same front end parts had been used from the early 70's up in to the late 90's ! Nice again to step back in time and keep on bricking everyone !"
p557
aS"I voted 'Outstanding"
p558
aS"' Regarding this set, I found mine at a consignment store"
p559
aS' It was inside of a larger set from the same time period'
p560
aS'Woah'
p561
aS" 25 cents for a mint condition set! That's amazing"
p562
aS"Well, it's not exactly a large shuttle, but still a nice set: 442 Space Shuttle Year Released: 1979 Piece Count: 79 Minifigs: 1 Vehicles: 0 List Price: unknown This little classic was my smallest classic space set"
p563
aS" Believe it or not, I still have the box: Here's the back: The instructions are pretty tattered and missing a section"
p564
aS" I had to download some from the web: But the ship is again intact, missing only one grey 1x3 plate: I've always liked this computer piece: Here's the under side"
p565
aS' This set included the small classic jet engines: A close-up of the sloped printed space brick: And the complete set with minifig: This set was a great little space ship that made a nice addition to the Blue Space Theme'
p566
aS' As small as it was, it could hold two-three figs (one standing up)'
p567
aS" I don't even think the Mars Mission Recon Drop Ship holds three figs"
p568
aS' In any case, it was a must-have for Blue Space Fans, and probably only a few bucks back in the day'
p569
aS' SWOOSH!'
p570
aS"It's simply amazing how far Lego has come in 30 years"
p571
aS'and again those tears in my eyes'
p572
aS' with original box'
p573
aS'! I really love those classic space stuff'
p574
aS' Looks like I need to clean my stuff this summer'
p575
aS'This classic space shuttle is simply superb! I love the layout of this shuttle'
p576
aS' In fact, it reminded me as one of the space fighter jet, that roam around in space, defending the boundaries from intruders'
p577
aS' I just love these old grey bricks very much and the printed computer brick is just lovely'
p578
aS" It's such a pity, that I did not grow up with Classic Space in my childhood"
p579
aS' These are actually great stuff, and formed the base of the Space theme in LEGO'
p580
aS' Brickster, thanks again for another outstanding classic review'
p581
aS'this was my first space set ever!! 1979, 1980'
p582
aS" don't know anymore, but i do remember i got this together with 897 for my birthday when we where camping"
p583
aS' with a little luck i may even have an old film from my dad, opening the boxes'
p584
aS' well what to say'
p585
aS' it looked soooooo aggressive with those two engines! but i never knew why you needed two steering wheels on it'
p586
aS' they probably just thought a symmetrical model was better '
p587
aS" i can't blame them"
p588
aS' what a nice set'
p589
aS' it would even sell today, no doubt'
p590
aS' looooots of swooshability'
p591
aS'The computer is my favorite part'
p592
aS' Sadly, I dont own any classic space'
p593
aS'Exept for some space police, and a blue classic space man'
p594
aS'Nice!!! 442 is the lowest set number I have seen for any Classic Space set, so it must been released with the first wave in 1978'
p595
aS' Its remarkable that a LEGO spaceship this old and small can seat more figs than the much bigger MX-71 Recon Dropship of today'
p596
aS' Anyway, I just want to grab it out of the screen and swoosh it all over the place, lol'
p597
aS" TLG, please make these Classic Space sets again! I promise I'll buy many!"
p598
aS'INDEXED Everyone remembers their first time'
p599
aS' For me, it was in 19*cough*somethingsomething*cough*'

p602
aS' uhhh'
p603
aS' Sorry, wrong story'
p604
aS' Um, yeahh'
p605
aS' Anyway, I do remember my first time'
p606
aS' It was 1977, in late summer'
p607
aS' Our neighbor, who worked for a department store called Famous-Bahr, said that the main store had a travelling LEGO display'
p608
aS' So my family filed into the car and drove into downtown St Louis to see this display'
p609
aS" To tell you the truth, I don't remember much about the display itself, but I DO remember that my parents bought me my first LEGO set"
p610
aS' Set # 456, the Spirit of St Louis'
p611
aS' Set #: 456 (also sold as Set # 661) Name: Spirit of St Louis Theme: LEGOLAND / Large Vehicle Year: 1977 Pieces: 49 Minifigs: 0 Price: $5'

aS'00 USD, Used Complete ~$35'
p614
aS'00 USD) Links: Peeron, Bricklink, Brickset Packaging Box Front: The original box that my set came in was most likely trashed 5 minutes after returning home'
p615
aS' This image was lovingly stolen off of the Peeron page for this set'
p616
aS' I feel lucky that I even got this much'
p617
aS' Similarly, I have no pictures of the plastic baggies the set came in'
p618
aS" Truth be told, I can't be sure that there even WERE plastic baggies that the parts came in"
p619
aS' THE SET Side View: Well there she is'
p620
aS' My first set ever '
p621
aS' Actually, I seem to recall the real Spirit of St Louis was silver colored, not Black and Yellow'
p622
aS" If you need a history lesson, the Spirit of St Louis was Charles Lindbergh's plane when he made the first trans-Atlantic solo flight"
p623
aS' More details can be found on the Wikipedia page'
p624
aS' The overall shape is pretty close, at least'
p625
aS' The cockpit window could stand to be moved forward one stud, but everything seems to be relatively close'
p626
aS" The tail piece isn't the right shape, but it is likely the only tail piece LEGO produced at the time"
p627
aS' If you look closely, you can see the various bite marks that my brother and I inflicted over the years'
p628
aS" I know some people would be aghast that there are bite marks, but brick separators wouldn't come out for another 10 years"
p629
aS' Besides, we were young'
p630
aS" We didn't know any better"
p631
aS' I certainly had no idea that it would become my obsession'
p632
aS' There are some interesting part choices here'
p633
aS' Everything is brick and plate built, as you might expect'
p634
aS' The same set nowadays would have lots of slope, wedges and wedge plates to round things out'
p635
aS" But LEGO was all about the brick in '77, so bricks are what we got"
p636
aS' The black inverted slopes worked pretty well asthetically as the wing struts'
p637
aS' The wings are simple 4 x 10 plates, nice and square'
p638
aS' There were no minifigs in this set'
p639
aS' If I remember correctly, 1977 was just about the time when minifigs made their first appearance'
p640
aS" I know I have one other set from '77 that does include a minifg, at least"
p641
aS" I don't have a lot of comments for the following photos"
p642
aS" I'll let the pictures speak for themselves"
p643
aS' 3/4 View Back Back 3/4 Top Front PARTS Interesting Pieces I have no idea if there were any extra pieces that came with this set'
p644
aS' I kind of doubt it'
p645
aS' Instead I took a photo of some of the interesting parts to the model'
p646
aS" That translucent white piece didn't photograph so well, but it is a Technic Axle 8"
p647
aS" That's right, sets from 1977 contained Technic elements"
p648
aS' The two black parts are the forerunners to the 1 x 2 Technic Brick, as well'
p649
aS' Everytime I hear someone on the forums complain about Technic elements in system sets, I think back to this set'
p650
aS' The round brick is special as well'
p651
aS' Here is a closer view of it, complete with bite marks '
p652
aS' Round Brick As you can see, the stud is closed'
p653
aS' It is only one of two closed stud 1 x 1 Round Bricks that I own'
p654
aS' They stopped appearing in sets in 1981, for those that are interested'
p655
aS" The DSS You thought you were going to escape this heading, didn't you? Surprise! Yes, even in 1977 LEGO sets had stickers"
p656
aS' The oldest printed elements I can remember were in the Classic Space sets that started in 1979'
p657
aS' Again, when people in the forums complain about DSS in sets, I can only help think of this set'
p658
aS' And chuckle to myself maniacally'
p659
aS" The sticker has held up really well considering it's been stuck on the brick for 32 years"
p660
aS' No discoloration, very little curling'
p661
aS' I think if all stickers held up this well over time, there would be less DSS complaints'
p662
aS' THE RATINGS Playability: 6/10 - The set is quite swooshable, and the propellor spins'
p663
aS' Outside of that, though'
p664
aS' Minifigs: N/A Design: 6/10 - The overall shape is quite good, especially given the era'
p665
aS' The color choice leaves a lot to be desired'
p666
aS" Price: 1/10 - It's been retired for 30 years"
p667
aS" It's going to cost you to get your hands on it"
p668
aS' Overall: 13/30 - This set is for true collectors only'
p669
aS" I can't imagine anyone wanting one because they want to play with it"
p670
aS' It was a great set back in the day, but the design feels REALLY dated'
p671
aS" And if you're wondering, mine is NOT for sale"
p672
aS' Ever'
p673
aS' All the photos, plus more, can be found in the Gallery'
p674
aS'Very brave to give an impression about one of the oldest sets ever reviewed! A lot members here are younger than the set itself'
p675
aS' I think you will have to have grown up with it to like it'
p676
aS' Nowadays we have seen quite a few better airplanes than that one, for example this years 7643 '
p677
aS' But thanks for letting us know'
p678
aS' Btw'
p679
aS', the 1x1 round brick with the solid stud is no'
p680
aS' 3062a instead of 3062b (with the hollow stud)'
p681
aS'Great job! I love reading vintage reviews, as it reminds of our childhood days'
p682
aS' Glad to see this in very good condition'
p683
aS' By the way, I will move this to LEGO Trains & Town, to see if TheBrickster will like to include this set inside the review index over there'
p684
aS' I believe he is maintaining vintage town set reviews over there, and this suits there well'
p685
aS"I'm sorry you had to move this topic, White Fang"
p686
aS' When it was in the Reviewers Academy, the teachers agreed it belonged in Other Themes'
p687
aS' *shrug* I guess it ended up where it belonged eventually'
p688
aS"Great review, It's good to see some of the old sets reviewed"
p689
aS' I think I learned something about the history of Lego from this one'
p690
aS'fantastic review! Id love to read more like this, trivia about old/rare pieces is almost as fun as the set itself'
p691
aS'Outstanding review of a very special set! I actually remember seeing this set on the store shelves of local department stores'
p692
aS' Can you believe it? Fantastic review Walter'
p693
aS' I really enjoy looking at these vintage sets'
p694
aS' This one deserves a BLOG!'
p695
aS'In 1977, trans or yellow slopes existed already, and using them would have made the plane more realistic'
p696
aS' A third rear wheel would have enhanced playability and design, rather than this ugly black round brick'
p697
aS' It\'s the reason why I voted "below average" even considering 1977\'s standards'
p698
aS' However this set is nice and simple, offering good playability'
p699
aS'Here is the Spirit of St Louis'
p700
aS' Just go there (Washington) and have a look of this legend : Cavannus, on Jul 15 2009, 09:40 PM, said: In 1977, trans or yellow slopes existed already, and using them would have made the plane more realistic'
p701
aS" I don't think so"
p702
aS' There is no 45 slope in the original plane design '
p703
aS' and no front cockpit window'
p704
aS' Quote A third rear wheel would have enhanced playability and design, rather than this ugly black round brick'
p705
aS" Except that it wouldn't have been the Spirit Of St Louis"
p706
aS" This set is a great one and I wish I'd bought it in '77"
p707

p717
aS' Luckily, the rocket was defective having rather flimsy white bricks that did not stay together well during launch attempts'
p718
aS' Lego scrapped its WMD program and the result was this classic "blue era" space set known as the Alpha-1 Rocket Base'
p719
aS" Instructions: On the backside of the instructions, the set is featured with the Space Command Center, Space Cruiser, and a few vehicle sets: The set includes three figs: And this great rocket fuel tanker: Here's the front section complete with computer: And the rocket fuel section: The set has some interesting features including the Control Section, Fuel Control, and Launch Pad: On top of the Control Section is a nicely design radar/tracking system: Here's the open control room: The Launch Pad and Fuel Control: The Fuel Control includes two sink pieces and blue steering wheels: And Lego's WMD (Weapon of Mass Destruction), the Alpha-1 on the Launch Pad: Here's a shot of the launching mechanism: Unfortunately, I have lost one of the blue sink/faucet pieces as well as a black hose: A close-up of the Alpha-1 Rocket"

aS' The white bricks never stayed together well often times coming apart within your hands: Huh, did they not think of putting a technic axle down the center of the rocket? Come to think of it, when were technic axles invented'
p727
aS' Its a neat little set, makes me think I oughta make some similar kinda layout in LDD, very elegant for playability'
p728
aS'I always thought that that grey thing on top of the rocket was some kind of satelite'

p732
aS' Great review!'
p733
aS'wooow! what a set!! not all that large, most defenitely not as sophisticated as the message intercept base from 10 years later, but in those, this was all a kid need to have hours of fun'
p734
aS' soooo many great parts on this one'
p735
aS' technic hoses, computers, rocket parts, trans yellow parts'

aS"Hey EB'ers, i got my Market Street on Monday and finished building it last night"
p747
aS' I know it?s not such a nice review like *yoda* did the last times, but i hope you enjoy some of the pics'
p748
aS' First a pic of the complete building: The 3 Minifigs: and i pic of the stairs (one of my highlights at this set): More pics you can find here My opinion about the set: I like this set very much, it was really fun to build it'
p749
aS' I?m happy that that i got some more cherries and a croissant now *sweet* , a funny idea is the salad in the one box at the front'
p750
aS' i think normally it?s a hairpiece of an exoforce fig'
p751
aS' I also like the colours of the house, the dark blue is sooooo nice'
p752
aS' I think i have to take more of this soon'
p753
aS' The lighter blue is also nice'
p754
aS' This set has really nice details like the stairs, or the owl at the entry of the market, or the balcony'
p755
aS' I paid 89,99 EUR, a fair price for a really nice set!! Greetings Sandra'
p756
aS"Thanks for the review, my favourite detail is the salad! :-D BTW, could you exchange the modules and make pics of that? I'd like to see how the building looks with the flat roof instead of the dutch style one"
p757
aS" I'm not sure though if the vents on the flat roof makes sense as long as it's only used as a garage top"
p758
aS' :-/ Maybe they should be removable as the balconies and such things to make the modularity leading not to weird results'
p759
aS' Other than this: In combination with a lot of money and the Cafe Corner set this really could get me into city! ;-)'
p760
aS"thanks for the great review! *sweet* now that i've seen the set, I'm afraid i'm a bit disappointed 8-| 1) the color combination doesn't really do it for me"
p761
aS" blue, dark blue, grey, black, tan, white, they're all mixed together without any over all design"
p762
aS" 2) is there any interior? it doesn't look like it, and in any case, you can only reach it if you remove the modules"
p763
aS' hm'
p764
aS' |-/ now it looks too much of a box'
p765
aS' 3) there are most certainly some nice ideas in this model and some great parts'
p766
aS" the best part of the model is the staircase 4) i don't think he spent much time in thinking about the design"
p767
aS" As apo said, the chimneys on top of a garage is kinda weird, there's also a gate, next to another gate which is weird as well"
p768
aS' also, if this is supposed to ba a grocery, then the owner has done a lot to hide it'
p769
aS" The croissant is nice, but next to the brown box with vegies, there's nothing that suggests this is a shop"
p770
aS' 5) the white lamp and the the yellow cylinder are at the same level of the tiles'
p771
aS' IMO it should be above the level of the tiles'
p772
aS' 6), IMO not worth the 90 euro Edited by snefroe1, 20 June 2007 - 09:03 AM'
p773
aS'Thanks, I love the look of this set! I love the mix of colours, it breaks up the model rather than being a single monotone colour'
p774
aS" He's used several complimentary colours in order to make up the model"
p775
aS' I agree I think the chimneys on the flat roof is weird ontop of the garage, but not so weird one you place it ontop of the building'
p776
aS" I guess he's done it to give us the choice of roofs and chimneys"
p777
aS" You can always remove the ones you don't like"
p778
aS' He also seems to have screwed up a bit on the tiling for the sidewalk on the side module'
p779
aS" On Cafe Corner (And the building module of this set) the sidewalk has the pattern light grey 1x6 at the front, then dark grey 1x2 next, then dark grey 2x2's"
p780
aS" However on this he's put the 2x2 tiles first then the 1x2's at the back"
p781
aS' Easilly fixable though'
p782
aS' Overall I love this set, thanks for the pics! Compliments Cafe Corner perfectly'
p783
aS'Thank you Legocastlegirls for your quick review! *y* It?s the first time I realize the back of the market street'
p784
aS' The tan bricks are a replacement for some windows I?d guess? I do love that building, especially the top floor with the neat balcony'

p786
aS' But I just had some food parts ordered at Bricklink'
p787
aS' X-D One thing I?d like to know: This is an online-exclusive, right? Can I order it at a Lego-store (K?ln / Oberhausen) and get the sum rewarded on my voucher booklet? *sweet* I heard it here, but I?m not sure'
p788

aS'Hi Thanks for posting those great pictures'
p791
aS' I got the CC some time ago and I really looking forward to get my hands on the Market Street'
p792
aS' I think the colour scheme of this set is great, maybe because blue is my favourite colour (just check my wardrobe)? I really like the design of the roof and the staircase'
p793
aS' I ?am not so sure if I like the gateways but I believe they will grow on me when I get the set myself snefroe1, on Jun 20 2007, 09:02 AM, said: 5) the white lamp and the the yellow cylinder are at the same level of the tiles'

p796
aS' Actually I have put a 2x2 plat under the lamppost on my CC, looks much better if you ask me'
p797

p821
aS" And considering this is a three floro, small structure, and it's over 1,000 parts, just imagine (pun not intended) how many peices are in LL California's Empire State Building or WTC Freedom Tower models! Both are large and in real scale over 100 floors! That's a lot of bricks"

aS' Nonsense Sandra !! Tks for sharing these cool pics ;-) Its also a nice hommage to Erik Brok'
p826
aS' I really like this set, I think its really well designed with great ideas such as the dual stairs, the balconies, the croissant insignia, the market entrance design with the horns, whip and owl 8-? I like the color combination, and the mosaic design just in front of the entrance'
p827
aS" The only terrible flaw is that yellow cinlinder !! That is just awful for a flower pot :-X I don't mind at all having that lamp post at the same level since it would be normal to have the base of the lamp at the level of the tile but I agree that is just pickering about an insignificant detail :-P Legocastlegirl, on Jun 20 2007, 07:42 AM, said: a funny idea is the salad in the one box at the front"

p904
aS'Well, now that I have some money, a trip to ToysRUs was obviously in my future, especially since my local TRU has much of the summer 2007 lineup'
p905
aS' When I got there, almost all the smaller Castle sets had been sold out, but there was one left: the one I am now reviewing for both Eurobricks and BZPower'
p906
aS' ;-) The Box: Well, for starters, the Castle theme boxes are beautiful! The blended clear and stormy skies give a great ?clash of the titans? effect, and the action poses help as well'
p907
aS' ;-) The back is equally nice, featuring a photo showing kids how to use the crossbow, and the brave axe wielder taking a swipe at the skeleton (foolish soldier, that won?t work on skellies! See later on in the review to find out why)'
p908
aS' And of course, we have a small box with the link to the official Lego website, where TLC can advertise even more Lego sets! :P The Contents: After opening the box, a single bag of pieces (with a couple loose ones), the instruction manual and necessary catalog ( :-P ), and a new wider rubber band holder spilt out'
p909
aS' The instruction manual is clear as a bell'
p910
aS' No color trouble here, folks! Also, it?s worth mentioning the nice background with the mountain and King?s castle silhouettes'
p911
aS" :-) Sorry that there's no picture, but I'll take one if someone wants to see it"
p912
aS' ;-) The Pieces: For being a 5 dollar set (well, seven in my case'
p913
aS' Darn your above average prices, TRU!), Crossbow Attack features a lot of nice pieces (as does the entire Castle lineup)'
p914
aS' Notable elements include two large brown spoked wheels, two brown modified 1x1?s, a pearl gold slope end, and SIX dark blue modified 1x1x2/3 slopes! The bulk of the pieces, however, are nothing special'
p915
aS' I?ll let the picture do the talking for this'
p916
aS' The accessories are by far the best parts in this kit'
p917
aS' Two different helmets in a beautiful shiny silver are my favorite, but I also really like the scythe (looks good for MOCing) and the round shield ( *wub* ), which are both brand new parts'
p918
aS' And can anyone not love the classic axe and crossbows? Oh, and there?s a black lightsaber too, but that?s rather boring compared to the other parts'
p919
aS' :-P The Minifigures: Can you say, FOUR figures (including the horse)?! That has to be a record for a regular 5 dollar set, at least in the present age of limited figures per set'
p920
aS' We?ll start out with the two Crown militia: a regular soldier and an archer'
p921
aS' Both have old faces, but they look spiffy with the shiny helmets and the superb torsos'
p922
aS' I?ll name the soldier Bravo the Stout and the archer Angler the Precise, for future references'
p923
aS' Now we come to the skellie'
p924
aS' Although some people dislike the new skeleton design, I personally prefer it to the old ones, since the arms are now poseable and the face much meaner'
p925
aS' The only problem is that the arms hang too low, but it?s not too noticeable when they have weapons in their hands'
p926
aS' And last, but not least, here?s the elusive skeleton horse'
p927
aS' I for one am very happy that TLC took advantage of that awesome prototype piece and made it into an official mass-production mold'
p928
aS' However, the horse is unfortunately one piece, but since regular Lego horses are as well, I don?t have a problem with it'
p929
aS' I do have a problem with the pose, however'
p930
aS' The legs are in quite an odd position, and I wonder why TLC didn?t make the front and back leg poses symmetrical'
p931
aS' Ah well'
p932
aS' The Finished Set: I have only two pictures here, since this set is so small'
p933
aS' First, here?s the completed crossbow'
p934
aS' I must say: FINALLY! No more ridiculous horse mounted catapults or crazy fire wheel launchers! Now we have realistic siege weapons, including the one included with 7090'
p935
aS' Plus, it actually launches okay, although not the best'
p936
aS' Here?s the other main attraction: the completed skeleton rider and horse'
p937
aS' I think it?s rather dramatic with that pose and the dark background, don?t you think? ;-) Playability: Okay, so there?s not much in this set, but a bit of imagination brings plenty of possibilities'
p938
aS' To show you what you can do, here?s a little story made only with this set'
p939
aS' ;-) Overall Rating: Presentation: 9/10 Pieces: 8/10 Minifigures: 9/10 Finished model: 8/10 Playability: 8/10 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Final Score: 8'
p940
aS'4/10 Crossbow Attack is a fine introduction into Castle, so I recommend it to any Lego fan, whether they are a castle nut or just want a cheap change of pace'

aS' TLC has a knack with making great small kits these days, and I more than ever support them in their amazing rebound from their dark ages (between 1997 and 2004)'

aS"Thanks for this review, and that great little comic! About the skellies though (X-D), you have to admit that besides their long arms making the skellie legs look out of proportion, that they're just made poorly"
p944
aS" They're sticking straight out, as opposed to every other fig, which have a slight bend to make them look more natural"
p945
aS" Also, as I'm sure you've noticed, the pegs are on angles! That makes it impossible for them to hold their weapons straight, and they can't even put their arms over their heads without stressing the plastic some"
p946
aS" I mean they're DEAD"
p947
aS" Well, at least undead, they're not supposed to be stiff, and personally I like the ragdoll look more, it makes them seem more dead :-P"
p948
aS'A very nice review with good pictures, thanks Grevious'
p949
aS' *y* And undead ragdolls on! :-P'
p950
aS'WOW! That was both an entertaining time, and a learning experience! It was entertaining because the comic made me laugh! It was a learning experience because, well, I dunno'
p951
aS' Just wanted to say it'
p952
aS' Anyways, great review, Grievous! Edited by trooperdavinfelth, 01 July 2007 - 09:46 PM'
p953
aS'Very nice little review'
p954
aS" Tis too bad I'm skint and can't afford any sets at the moment"
p955
aS' Loved the little story too! Also, on your comment about the skellie horses'
p956
aS" All Lego horses are posed like that because it's the way horses walk"
p957
aS' Check it next time you can'
p958
aS'Thanks for the review'
p959
aS' That set is high up on my list; how could it not be with a price like that! (I love the added story'
p960
aS'Excellent photographs! and I like the comic too'
p961
aS" I don't care what anyone says, I love the new skeletons"
p962
aS' *skull*'
p963
aS'Nice review, and great little story'
p964
aS' :-D *y* Look at the normal horses, their legs are positioned like that too'
p965
aS" Only the skellie horse's legs are touching, so as to strengthen the middle, otherwise it could easily snap in half"
p966
aS" Also, I think the new skeletons are nice, their head is awesome, I just don't see why TLC couldn't make the bent droid arms with the hand facing vertically, instead of making a new arm design completely straight"
p967
aS'Nice review and a great story also grevious, this is a great set and a nice little army builder one at that'
p968
aS' The only thing that saddens me about the line itself is the new arms on the skelies, they just look far to big when placed next to a normal fig'
p969
aS' For me the old versions of the skelies were far better, why tlc changed to this is beyond me'
p970
aS' Still i shall be buying alot of these sets just to increase my army'
p971
aS'Tks a lot Grevious for this !! Regarding the set I just love it !! I really oved your comic, it was really well done and hilarious X-D EB Spirit ON !! Vader, on Jul 2 2007, 08:28 AM, said: Still i shall be buying alot of these sets just to increase my army'

p974
aS'Thanks for all the comments, guys, and thank you, JoeM16 and iamded for pointing out the reason for the skeleton horse leg positioning'
p975
aS" ;-) Well, I'll be gone on vacation until the 16, but I may pick up a set or two while down in Tenessee, so if I do, expect a review and another story when I get back! ;-)"
p976
aS"This is the only one of the new castle sets I've been able to get hold of so far"
p977
aS" I know others have done it before, but as soon as I'd got it, there was something I just had to try: Heh, cool! *skull*"
p978
aS'Grim Reaper ON! The new skellie looks so much more natural with the droid arm *y* !'
p979
aS'Great review, i love this set'
p980
aS"Great review *y* Small set with great figs and pieces=must buy The story was hilarious :-) Any chance you are going to review another set? I'm still waiting for a certain member *cough*Hinckley*cough* to review skeleton tower :-D Piranha"

aS" OK, now ot the set: Let's say I buy 3, for ?12"
p994
aS" That's 6 soldiers, 3 skellies and 3 horses"
p995
aS" Considering each fig is worth ?1 and horses 75p, that means 25p for the catapult! Awesome! There's no Lego Castle anywhere in England! :-/"

p1011
aS'That was a great review!!! very entertaining! :-D love the comics!'
p1012
aS'Here is a review of the new Monster Dino creator set with power functions First lets start with the box which is much larger than it needs to be!! It is one of the new style re-closeable boxes rather than the rip the sides style'
p1013
aS' This set is typical of creator and comes with three sets of instructions'
p1014
aS' The Monster Dino a kind of spider and a Crocodile The set comes with two of the new motors one small and one large, a sound module plus the new IR controler and receiver'
p1015
aS' There is a mix of techniques in this set the core is mainly studless technic, there are some studded technic parts and most of the details are standard creator style'
p1016
aS' There are two mechanisms one to control the legs and one to control the head and arms'
p1017
aS' The leg drive is from the large motor and the arm and head are operated from the small motor The completed mechanism will stand on its own without any detail added The detail is added to the base unit to complete the model'
p1018
aS' The operation of the Dino is very good the design for the motors and drives is very compact and well thought out'
p1019
aS' The walking motion works well although there is no steering and it will fall over it it encounters obstacles'
p1020
aS' The sound module is built into the head so when the mouth opens the Dino roars (sort of) Glyman made the comment that this set is ugly as sin and I tend to agree I think there are too many colour variations with different shades of grey, black and that lime green :-P which confuses the look of the finished model but I guess it might apeal more to younger kids'
p1021
aS' I also do not like the spikes along the back, which glow in the dark, because the are loose and keep falling off'
p1022
aS' This set is not cheap at ?70 but I guess this is because of the motors and IR controller'
p1023
aS' While on this I was surprised how good the range was on the new controller it would still operate ever when not in direct line of sight'
p1024
aS' I would give this set a 10/10 for playabilityit has kept the kid amused for hours I would give it 6/10 for value for money it is a bit pricey Overall 8/10 It took approx 3 hours to build and has been well played with I have posted some more images and some videos of the finished models on my brickshelf page HERE If you have any questions please ask Pete Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 06:28 PM'
p1025
aS' Indexed'
p1026
aS'Thanks for your review Ickelpete! *y* Nice little movie you made (what?s on tv in the background?) ;-) :-D After reading, I wonder more than before what this Dino has to do with Creator? *wacko* The complete mechanism is technic, only the "design"-pieces on top are classic-style'
p1027
aS' I agree with your comment on the colour-selection'
p1028
aS' :-X Is that turquise next to lime? Looks like - well, I?m not telling you what I think of right now'
p1029
aS' ;-) Pretty Lego set, but not for me'
p1030
aS' I?m waiting for the first pics of the ferris wheel'
p1031
aS" Or even better, the 8275 Technic-Bulldozer :'-) *wub* New motors On!"
p1032
aS'Thanks very much for that review'
p1033
aS' I downloaded the instructions last week and I was largely impressed with what was in it'
p1034
aS' However, like Holodoc, I am waiting for the Bulldozer'
p1035
aS' I might have to settle with the dino though if Lego charge Australian some absurd price'
p1036
aS' EDIT: I just watched the videos'
p1037
aS' Thanks! They are great'
p1038
aS' The dino is better than I thought'
p1039
aS' Edited by Sinner, 10 July 2007 - 02:29 AM'
p1040
aS'Thank you very much for that interesting review, Ickelpete'
p1041
aS' *y* Well, the color scheme?s pretty bad and the design of that Dino?s a bit to blocky for my liking, but the two alternative models you?ve built?re quiet nice'
p1042
aS' At least there?re a lot of possibilities coming with that set'
p1043
aS'Tks a lot for your review Ickelpete ;-) I saw that set at TRU a couple of weeks ago but was really not interested due to the design - I am not a fan of those motorized Lego sets |-/ I guess the lime colour is to please kids, as well as the general design, far from a real dino ;-) I am sure that its going to sell well to a younger croud'
p1044
aS' Let me quote you here: Quote The walking motion works well although there is no steering and it will fall over it it encounters obstacles'
p1045
aS' Hum, I really hope it works welll because I will have to buy that motorized AT-AT and I dont want it to crash :-P *yoda*'
p1046
aS'Ickelpete, on Jul 9 2007, 11:19 PM, said: First lets start with the box which is much larger than it needs to be!! Pete No LEGO box is too big my friend X-D ;-) Nice review *y* As for the set'
p1047
aS" I don't like the colors myself (surprised? X-D ), and it seems a little blocky"
p1048
aS' Otherwise, the set is cool'
p1049
aS' I really like the head'
p1050
aS'Ugly'
p1051
aS' As'
p1052
aS' Hell'
p1053
aS' But an awesome parts pack, worthy of purchase'
p1054
aS":'-) Such a beauty, the functions are great, cool video! I want to get this set so badly"
p1055
aS' Great review! *y*'
p1056
aS'I bought this set last night and it is great'
p1057
aS" My biggest surprise was the wheels that were included; I didn't even know they existed and there aren't even that new"
p1058
aS' Back to the set, he is such a cute dinosaur'
p1059
aS' :-D Since he is so tubby I think he looks like a baby! I suspect my wife wanted him more than me'
p1060
aS' my biggest interest in the set was to have more motors and IR parts so I could make an IR car'
p1061
aS' Overall, I highly recomend this set, but as others have said, be warned that the box is very oversized'
p1062
aS' I wish Lego would give up on this whole 1:1 picture thing'
p1063
aS' *wacko*'
p1064
aS"The box is has really strange dimensions - it's very flat but has a large front - the 1:1 scale"
p1065
aS" Regarding the spines, because they're made of the softer non-ABS plastic (the stuff the 1994 cutlasses and brown muskets were made of), they lose their shape a bit and so are hard to grip; they simply fall off"
p1066
aS" I suppose TLC use loads of different colours because a single or two-colour dino isn't very nice to look at, especially when the surface isn't very smooth - it takes your eyes away from the surface and puts it on the colours"
p1067
aS" Someone should make an all terrain dino that can walk everywhere from this set - I don't have the skill with technic - I always end up layering and never finish any models"
p1068
aS'Thanks for the nice review'
p1069
aS" It's butt ugly to me but the motors + IR control seem pretty neat ! Even at that high price, it looks like a good parts pack ! *sweet*"
p1070
aS"I didn't spot this great review earlier"
p1071
aS' Thanks for the effort of posting all those pics and videos, they helped me decide that this set is worth getting'
p1072
aS'Got this baby via shop@home a little early and I though it was time to post my view of this set : (Snefroe you NEED to get this one ;-) ) Sorry for the lack of pics but there are already many pics online of this baby So here it is : Best space set since'
p1073
aS' a way too long time This is my first new space themed set since more than 20 years and I must say that Im not disappointed at all'
p1074
aS' I have much to say about this little gem'
p1075
aS' First, lets cut it straight about the Martians minifigures: they are absolutely rubbish'
p1076
aS' I cant imagine how Lego could produce such atrocity'
p1077
aS' This said; lets move on to the dropship'
p1078
aS' A real piece of art'
p1079
aS' Reminiscent of the Aliens movie dropship'
p1080
aS' The cockpit is spacious and provides a great field of view, too bad there is no hinges to open it, you must remove the canopy completely to switch pilot'
p1081
aS' The drilling unit can be attached under the ship with the clever use of a rubber piece'
p1082
aS' It stays well in place once attached, good point'
p1083
aS' Some people dont like the inclusion of the 2 containment area for the Martians and crystal on both side of the ship but I kind like it, it makes the ship less empty'
p1084
aS' The 2 wings are complete with air intake, some armaments and 1 standard launcher on the right wing'
p1085
aS' Normally I dont like launchers but this one is very discrete and well integrated'
p1086
aS' On the tail section are 2 thrusters that can be rotated and provide thus some realistic movements to the ship'
p1087
aS' One of the last highlight of this ship is the landing gears, or I must say landing dishes'
p1088
aS' 6 medium sized radar dishes provide and incredible stability to the set'
p1089
aS' They are quite sturdy and can take a beating'
p1090
aS' Im not going to review the alien spaceship in detail since its quite uninteresting'
p1091
aS' I consider it more like a bonus addition to the set than anything else'
p1092
aS' The look is passable and there are some interesting building techniques in it'
p1093
aS' Thats all'
p1094
aS' To end the review, a little pros/cons table'
p1095
aS' (We all love pros/cons table :-) ) Pros: - Incredible design - At last a decent space set - Modular functions - Quite Sturdy - Beautiful - Great value for money Cons: - Martians are rubbish - No hinges for the canopy - The drilling unit could use some more details'
p1096
aS' Score: 9/10 By the way , I added a nice cool feature on my site , you can download the stickers for some sets that I own'
p1097
aS' Before building I always scan the stickers, we never know it could come handy'
p1098
aS' check this out on my site (you need to go in the Lego lists on the left): [VTX] Classic games'

aS' hmm, now I?m pretty sure that I?ll have to MOD that cockpit a little when I get that set'
p1104
aS"Great review, I must admit I didn't like MM at first site, but seeing this review and looking at the MM boxes at stores appeal to me rather greatly, I may get a couple of these sets, great job! *y* :-)"
p1105
aS"I've got it also, but i think i'll replace the ball joint pieces with the kind of pieces that give the wings their angle"
p1106
aS'great review *sweet* maybe i will buy this one'
p1107
aS' but not this month'
p1108
aS' buying lego in billund has left me totally broke :-X :-$'
p1109
aS'i like the dropship kit and got this'
p1110
aS' Now that I built it I see so many things I can do to tweak it to make it a MOC'
p1111
aS' I think this is a set everyone MM fan should get'
p1112
aS'Nice review!'
p1113
aS'The dropships looks neat, and your review is good'
p1114
aS" It isn't my theme, but it clearly is a fantastic set for the space lovers under us"
p1115
aS' Mars Mission is really a good step in the right direction for TLC'
p1116
aS'Of course, right before I post this I see that Ickelpete reviewed this set earlier in the week'
p1117
aS' Sorry for being redundant but it is already written so here ya go: Monster Dino Reviewed by Dunamis Set 4958 792 Pieces $89'
p1118
aS'95 from LEGO Online Store Build time 3'
p1119
aS'5 hours Here we go with another offering from the Creator line'
p1120
aS' I?m kind of fond of these sets as they are pretty imaginative and usually have instructions for multiple models'
p1121
aS' I like the reusability of all the pieces and the varied things you can build'
p1122
aS' The Box: The box that LEGO shipped this thing in was absolutely huge! When I first got this in the mail, I thought I had won the lottery and they had shipped the UCS Falcon early'
p1123
aS' Once I opened the shipping box, I was surprised to see an unusually large Creator set box'
p1124
aS' The box itself is pretty standard Creator type box but this one shows off the Power Functions prominently on the right side of the box'
p1125
aS' The back of the box shows some of the motorized features as well'
p1126
aS' Opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals'
p1127
aS' We?re back to the reusable cereal box type tab system for those of you who stay up a night wondering about LEGO?s next box design'
p1128
aS' Inside the box we have a bunch of sealed bags'
p1129
aS' Immediately the power brick, remote and motors stand out as they are each in individual bags'
p1130
aS' Also, there are three manuals'
p1131
aS' The Manuals: The three manuals are 76, 76 and 56 pages in length'
p1132
aS' They are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings: - Piece call outs for each step - Parts inventory at the end of the primary model build - Page numbers Color separation in these manuals were fine for me'
p1133
aS' Interestingly, the instructions for the primary build took a full manual plus about a quarter of another manual'
p1134
aS' Random manual photos: Parts list I?ll explain a bit more below, but it would have been nice to have some written documentation on all the functions of the motors, remote and receiver'
p1135
aS' Such as motor load guidelines and specific explanations of all the remote control functions'
p1136
aS' It is severely lacking in this area'
p1137
aS' The Pieces: Obviously, the pieces we?re most interested in are these new motors and wireless remote control'
p1138
aS' Note that before you fire this bad boy up, you had better BYOB'
p1139
aS' Since this is prominently a European community, I had better clarify my acronyms'
p1140
aS' Over here across the pond, BYOB usually means ?Bring Your Own Beer?'
p1141
aS' In this case, it still means bring your own beer (I?m on my second Heineken right now) but in addition to numerous bottles of beer you will need a total of NINE batteries to get through this set'
p1142
aS' I kid you not: Anyway, there are two motors (a small and a large) each with its own very unique name according to the manual; the smaller one is called ?motor? and the larger one is called ?XL motor?'
p1143
aS' Very creative indeed! The battery box takes SIX AA batteries and there are two compartments to hold them'
p1144
aS' Here is the first: That seems pretty normal'
p1145
aS' However, the back side of it holds the other three batteries and it seems to be very poorly designed: Note in the photo above where the bottom battery is placed'
p1146
aS' Compare it to the previous photo and you will see the difference'
p1147
aS' I played around with trying to get that bottom battery out and you better pack a lunch (or BYOB) because it is no small task! Why couldn?t they make this compartment just like the other side? There is a single power cord connector and a three position switch'
p1148
aS' The middle position turns the power OFF and the other two positions seem to provide the same functionality in either position as far as I can tell'
p1149
aS' Perhaps a little blurb in the manual would have been nice to clear things up a bit'
p1150
aS' The remote takes three AAA batteries'
p1151
aS' It is fairly small and lightweight even with the batteries installed'
p1152
aS' It has two thumb controls which could be levers if you insert Technic bars or even pins'
p1153
aS' The two controls are color coded and match the plugs on the receiver to control two separate motors'
p1154
aS' In addition, there is a four position switch which I assume changes the channel'
p1155
aS' Finally, there are two tiny levers that seem to have no function'
p1156
aS' I?m not sure if they are a trim control or variable speed control'
p1157
aS' I messed with them and didn?t notice any difference in the motor speed'
p1158
aS' Again, some documentation from the incredibly verbose LEGO manual would have helped'
p1159
aS' As far as the rest of the parts, it?s really a mixed bag'
p1160
aS' There are a lot of varied parts in this set to the point that there is almost one of everything'
p1161
aS' Lots of Technic gears, pins, studded beams, studless beams, axles, wheels, etc'
p1162
aS' Also, lots of little 1x1 slopes in various colors, teeth, horns, etc'
p1163
aS' You can?t really say it is a parts pack because there is not enough of one thing to make it a parts pack'
p1164
aS' A couple of notes: It seems the quality control issue on the axles has been fixed'
p1165
aS' I initially reported this back when I reviewed the 8285 about a year ago'
p1166
aS' All the axles worked fine for me'
p1167
aS' The color quality control issue is still alive'
p1168
aS' Check out the different shade of red in these two parts: Also included is the sound brick'
p1169
aS' This looks just like the other sound or light-up bricks we have been seeing lately'
p1170
aS' It does have a load dinosaur ?roar!? sound embedded in it though so hide the younglings if they are a bit on the skittish side'
p1171
aS' Finally, I?ve never seen one of these before (although someone will no doubt rattle off a dozen sets where you can find this part in about 5 seconds): No, I am not referring to the studded beam, I put that in the photo for scale'
p1172
aS' The Build: The build was fun and was fairly straightforward'
p1173
aS' As I mentioned, there is a lot of Technic parts, so if you are not a fan of the Technic line you should run, not walk away from this one'
p1174
aS' There were no gotchas to speak of, but you need to pay careful attention to the placement of the wires that go from the motors to the receiver'
p1175
aS' They kind of sneak them around a bit so watch closely'
p1176
aS' Otherwise, it was fine'
p1177
aS' Here is what is left over: So far, I have only built the primary model'
p1178
aS' As seen on the box, there are instructions for two more models'
p1179
aS' Both of the other models seem less complex than the primary model and are likely quicker builds'
p1180
aS' The Dino took me about 3'
p1181
aS'5 hours which included some time to screw around with the motors'
p1182
aS' I?m an old school Technic fan from way back in the 80?s so I had some familiarity with the old Technic motors'
p1183
aS' Obviously, 25+ years has improved some things and these seem much more powerful'
p1184
aS' The Design: If you have built the 4507 Prehistoric Creatures then some of the design will feel familiar, especially the head and tail'
p1185
aS' It is almost like they took the dinosaur from that set and figured out how to motorize it'
p1186
aS' This is not necessarily a bad thing, just a comment'
p1187
aS' The set does a good job of showing off the features of the new motors and remote'
p1188
aS' It is nice to see how one motor can perform multiple functions'
p1189
aS' In this case, the small motor makes both arms move and opens and closes the mouth of the dinosaur'
p1190
aS' When the mouth is completely open, it pushes the activation switch on the sound brick which emits the ?roar!? sound'
p1191
aS' Pretty cool'
p1192
aS' The ?XL Motor? handles the walking feature of the dinosaur'
p1193
aS' There is both forward and reverse'
p1194
aS' Forward works really well while the reverse just makes the dinosaur look like he is doing a Michael Jackson moon walk'
p1195
aS' (Wow, I never thought I would use Michael Jackson?s name in a LEGO Dinosaur set review!) It is almost like the dinosaur can?t get traction going in reverse'
p1196
aS' However, as noted previously forward works really well'
p1197
aS' This guy actually gets going at a pretty good clip'
p1198
aS' As you might expect, he kind of waddles like a duck since there is no articulation in the knees'
p1199
aS' It is a bit awkward but it works'
p1200
aS' The ?XL Motor? seems to kick out plenty of power'
p1201
aS' Overall, the design seems to be a mixed bag'
p1202
aS' The way the tail is attached seems to be an afterthought'
p1203
aS' The arms look to be too small'
p1204
aS' However, the walking mechanism and legs/feet are pretty cool as well as the head and mouth'
p1205
aS' I guess it is a reasonable effort to get people introduced to the parts and we?ll see designs improve as time goes on'
p1206
aS' Here are a few views of our new friend: But What About The AT-AT??? Of course, the real reason you are reading this is that you hope I will have some epiphany on how all this relates to the new walking AT-AT'
p1207
aS' Judging from the box on the AT-AT, it looks like we get one motor'
p1208
aS' I don?t see the remote which is a disappointment as I hope it is not controlled by a switch on the body and you either turn the AT-AT on or off'
p1209
aS' If that is the case, the first thing I am doing is scavenging the receiver and remote from this set to add to the AT-AT'
p1210
aS' Granted, it could be that it comes with a remote but is just not seen on the box'
p1211
aS' Also, the AT-AT box looks like one of the images shows that the head turns'
p1212
aS' I sure hope this is controlled separately as it would be really lame to not be able to control this independently from the walking feature'
p1213
aS' I?m kind of skeptical on the walking feature of the AT-AT'
p1214
aS' I suspect it will be rather cumbersome but hopefully I will be pleasantly surprised'
p1215
aS' Needless to say, this is all speculation but those are my initial thoughts based on this set'
p1216
aS' Overall Thoughts: It?s an OK set'
p1217
aS' Kind of pricy but I suspect a large part of that is due to the motors and remote'
p1218
aS' I haven?t built the other two models (they seem less interesting to me) but at least it has some variability'
p1219
aS' Also, you get a ton of different parts which can either be a good thing or bad thing depending on what you are looking for'
p1220
aS' The dinosaur is average'
p1221
aS' The color selection is marginal (black and lime green?) and the tail section is just lame'
p1222
aS' I appreciate it more for the mechanical functions and how the motorized parts work'
p1223
aS' It does do a good job of waking up my dog who seems pretty irritated by it'
p1224
aS' It is a nice set to show off to the neighbors or the endless caravan of my wife?s friends that seem to materialize out of nowhere'
p1225
aS' People are quickly impressed by it and then promptly move along once you start trying to explain how it all works'
p1226
aS' I?m a bit disappointed that the manual did not explain more about the remote and motor functions'
p1227
aS' I suspect that there is more than meets the eye and I?ll just have to play around with it to find out'
p1228
aS' It would be nice if LEGO had a website that showed all the cool functions of the motors and remotes so we fully understand the capabilities'

aS' If you really want the power functions the Bulldozer is better value as you get two large motors, two small motors and two receivers compared to the one in the Dino set alos watch Toysrus and argos both have had the Bulldozer for ?70-75 in there pre christmas sales usually for a week only I am hopeing they will be on sale soon as I want a Second Bulldozer to get some more motors'

p1302
aS' Excellent set to get the IR remote and IR receiver and other motors without paying insane amounts for the bulldozer now'
p1303
aS' There is a quite a number of parts in Power miner lime green and 1x1 white teeth plate for the mouth and claws'
p1304
aS' The dino alone has 20 teeth in its mouth The glow in the dark "antennas" on the backbone of the dino is a nice touch as you can let him walk in the dark somewhat'
p1305
aS" I do agree with the reviewer, the box IS INSANELY HUGE!!! I don't think Lego wanted to show a 1:1 scale dino, they just wanted to promote the power function stuff as large as possible"
p1306

p1315
aS' I can complain about another storm trooper either Parts- 3/5- Other than the dome pieces I commented on before, there is really not any new parts in this'
p1316
aS' If you build space, star wars, or machinery, this will still be a welcome assortment'
p1317
aS' Experience of Build 4/5- This really was a fun build'
p1318
aS' It came together fast but was challenging enough for its target age group'
p1319
aS' Playability 5/5- This thing is much more sturdy than it looks'
p1320
aS' The legs take a little bit of effort due to the double locking hinges but hold together very well'
p1321
aS'This is a very minor complaint'
p1322
aS' Value 4/5- Typical- $49'
p1323
aS"99 for 500 pieces- I must admit I paid a little more than MSRP due to shipping but I can't complain about the value"
p1324
aS' Overall: 21/25- I really believe this is one of the best walkers that Lego has designed'
p1325
aS' The only changes I would make would be adding real control panels in the cockpit and it would be nice if lego made a real widow to fit in with these types of builds rather than a transparent tile over another plate'
p1326
aS' All in all, I would recommend this set and I hope the rest of the 2015 Star Wars sets are on par with this'
p1327
aS"Thanks for the early review! I don't know much about the rebals show at all, but I can say that the over all design of the walker really appeals to me and the minifigs look top notch"

p1343
aS" Kallus's uniform is way too dark and should be more dark olive than black, and the drivers's uniforms are too bright and should be more greyish compared to what we saw in the series"

p1401
aS"Fantastic review, could easily be the year's best, and it's only January 1st! You've got a duplicated picture in the bit where the candy is being moved from the outside and through the barber shop"
p1402
aS'and I was expecting a final B&W picture or two where the detective makes his report to the woman in red, and gets his reward (candy, of course) or she in turn reports back to her real boyfriend, the candy smuggler'

aS' This review has greatly changed my view on this modular'
p1407
aS' A definite buy for me'
p1408
aS' Love the interiors and the whole concept'
p1409
aS' The more i see it the more i see the little features which put this set apart or at least slightly different from the others'
p1410
aS' Of course great playability for the younger lot and i think a nice building to give any Lego City more character and colour'
p1411
aS'Great review Oky! I really love your introduction text'
p1412
aS' You put a lot of effort in this review, with lots of nice touches'

aS" Great job Oky, amazing set, I'll be picking it up this weekend!"
p1417
aS'Great review Oky! I managed to pick this set up a few days ago and I must say, it might be my favorite modular yet for the feel alone'
p1418
aS" The pool hall, barbershop, and the detective's office itself are all wonderfully designed!"
p1419

p1422
aS' The height seems too small for comparison with the rest of the modulars'

aS' The play features are ok but I wish it would have been taller'
p1424
aS'Nice review, thanks a lot'

p1436
aS' Just one question: The mirror is on cardboard? I was hoping for it to be a window piece with a mirror on one side'
p1437
aS" I hope it's not the same cardboard we had on some of the early Harry Potter sets or the element won't last long"
p1438
aS'Thank you for the great review of this set'

aS"Lego's affiliation with six wheelers go back a long way"
p1462
aS' I think the first one was released in 1981, more than 25 years ago'
p1463
aS' This year, Lego added another one to the family, Mars Mission\'s "Rhino 1", as its title sounds'
p1464
aS" It's been a while since i've bought and opened a large box, so maybe this isn't a surprise to most of you, but the box does not open at the front, as with many larger sw boxes, but at the side"
p1465
aS' The two printed seals(or whatever people call them) have gone as well, being replaced by one larger print in the middle of side'
p1466
aS" the box also isn't as thick as a large sw box, like the sandcrawler"

aS'Nice Review *y* I have quick question though'
p1615
aS" Do the crystals fit into the aliens hands? Try and stick one in there,Becuase the new catalog shows an image of an alien holding a crystal Lastly lego should have made the aliens with movable arms and no hole in the middle |-/ I don't want to waste any money so I am only going to grab 1 or 2 of the smaller sets Piranha EDIT:IMO the aliens would win becuase they have superior technology and all they do is have to cut the airtank line and the humans die Edited by Piranha, 20 July 2007 - 01:40 AM"

aS' And have you SEEN the toys in the Frozen section of stores? HUGE playsets for Barbie-sized dolls'
p1663
aS" But I suppose I'm getting the cart before the horse here, reviewing before I've even opened the box"
p1664
aS' So'
p1665
aS" Name: Elsa's Sparkling Ice Castle Set Number: 41062 Pieces: 292 Price: $39"
p1666
aS'99 Minifigs: 3 Theme: Disney Princess Year of Release: 2015 Links: Bricklink Peeron Brickset The Box The front of the box is standard Lego fare, other than the large Anna and Elsa in the bottom right corner'
p1667
aS' Oh, and surprisingly, nowhere on the box is the normal minifig lineup'
p1668
aS' The only way to know what characters are included is to look at the set pictures'
p1669
aS' The 1:1 This set uses one of the minidolls as the actual size sample'
p1670
aS" That's probably not a bad choice since the minidolls are not nearly as well known as a minifig"
p1671
aS' The Back On the back, the play features are shown in insets around a rear view of the castle'
p1672
aS' Like Friends sets, you also have an array of play accessories'
p1673
aS" The Seals Is this standard on 2015 sets or is this specific to this set? I've never seen 3 tape seals on a set"
p1674
aS' Even huge modulars or Technic sets only have 2, so 3 on a set this small seems excessive'
p1675
aS" Perhaps Lego expects people to try to steal the dolls? If so, why bother with extra tape? A tiny pocketknife makes quick work of the tape so the third strip doesn't even slow you down"
p1676
aS' The Contents In the box are 2 instruction booklets (bent), a white plate, a sticker sheet, and 3 numbered bags of parts'
p1677
aS" The Stickers These are very hard to photograph since they're shiny"
p1678
aS' I mean polished chrome shiny'
p1679
aS" Those dark lines across the corners are not really there, they're reflections of my ceiling"
p1680
aS' The Manual Backs The back of one booklet has a Friends "Win!" girl'
p1681
aS' The other has an ad for the Lego Disney Princess website'
p1682
aS" That site is SO girly there's even sparkles following your mouse cursor around"
p1683
aS" So I didn't stay too long or look too deeply"
p1684
aS' The Sample Page The interior pages of the manuals are on lavender backgrounds'
p1685
aS" It's standard Lego instructions with part callouts and insets when needed"
p1686
aS" The Build, 1 The first thing you build is Anna, but I'm not showing that yet"
p1687
aS' Then you build this little picnic scene'
p1688
aS' It\'s tiny but effective, and nice to have something not icy in the set since the movie has the "In Summer" song for Olaf'
p1689
aS" I'm curious what's in that sandwich though - green and pink? After the picnic is the Olaf build, but I'll save him for later too"
p1690
aS' The Build, 2 Next is this small sleigh'
p1691
aS' It has an amazing amount of style for something so small'
p1692
aS' The curved front and decorative whips on the back make it look sleigh-like instead of blocky'
p1693
aS" But come on, it already had pink accents, are the pink flowers really necessary? Technically, yes, so the whips can mount to them, but still, it's just over-girly for my taste"
p1694
aS' The Build, 3 The sleigh needs a ramp to help it rocket along (for a couple inches, at least)'
p1695
aS' The ramp starts like this, with a hidden lime green jumper plate that gets a cookie on it'
p1696
aS" I couldn't remember anything in the movie like that, so I asked my wife and she couldn't either"
p1697
aS' A hidden cookie under a hill? The Build, 4 After putting the tilting 2x8 onto the base and adding decorations, this is the result'
p1698
aS' A lime green bucket holding a pair of ice skates, a flower (in the snow, really?), green and white round studs that I assume are supposed to be grass and snow? The Build, 5 The sleigh looks huge sitting on top of the tiny hill, but it actually works pretty well'
p1699
aS" Assuming you're on a smooth surface like a table, you can give the sleigh a little nudge and it'll shoot down the ramp and a few inches across the table"
p1700
aS" The unevenness of the slopes vs the blue tiles holds the sleigh in line well, and the bumps in the slopes don't seem to hamper anything"
p1701
aS' The Build, 6 Moving on to bag 2'
p1702
aS" man that's a lot of colors in this base already"
p1703
aS" And I'm already starting to feel like there's trans-blue cheese thrown around randomly"
p1704
aS' The Build, 7 Continuing (and rotating), some steps and even more colors thrown in'
p1705
aS" Magenta? In Elsa's ice palace? I sure don't remember any of that"
p1706
aS" The Build, 8 Wait, seriously? An ice cream stand in the castle? That is what the magenta is for? I kinda actually like the looks of it, but it doesn't fit the set"
p1707
aS" The Build, 9 Spinning back around, now there's a light aqua spiral staircase added along with a roof"
p1708
aS" This is where I'm really starting to wonder about Lego's thinking"
p1709
aS' Those light aqua stairs, and the light aqua 1x4 tiles, are exclusive to this set (as far as I know'
p1710
aS" it's possible some other 2015 sets use them, but nothing in Bricklink yet)"
p1711
aS" Seems expensive (to produce) to me, when there's no huge reason to need them"
p1712
aS' Another blue for the tiles would have been fine'
p1713
aS" And the spiral stairs? Really? Elsa's castle is KNOWN for staircases, but NOT spiral ones! There should be a huge straight ice stairway out front or sweeping curved stairs inside, but not a spiral"
p1714
aS' The Build, 10 And now we finish the tree'
p1715
aS" Again, why? Where is there a tree next to Elsa's castle? And so weird"
p1716
aS' with ice hanging from green branches that have both snow and flowers on them'
p1717
aS' Huh? Did Lego watch a different movie? The Trans-Light Blue Bits Before looking at the upper level, a brief pause to look at some other parts'
p1718
aS" Here's the 1x2x5 brick in trans-light blue and the 2x4x6 rock panel in glitter trans-light blue"
p1719
aS' Do those look like the same blue to you? And again, ANOTHER unique part for this set'
p1720
aS' Why do those rock panels need to be glitter, when Lego made the same panel in trans light blue in 2013 and 2014 for SuperHeroes, Friends, and Chima sets? Apparently Disney REALLY wanted glitter, because there are a bunch of trans-glitter parts in the new Princess sets'
p1721
aS" There's trans-neon green cones for Jasmine; Ariel, Jasmine, and Sleeping Beauty all get glitter trans purple cones"
p1722
aS" So there's a bunch of new glitter parts for 2015"
p1723
aS' The Build, 11 Back to building - time to add the upper level'
p1724
aS' We get a bedroom with a decent bed, although stickered'
p1725
aS' The Build, 12 The other side of the bedroom has some little accessories'
p1726
aS' Perfume and a crown I assume? The Build, 13 Time for walls and a roof'
p1727
aS" I like the small white macaroni bricks for a wall, but what's with the lavender fence piece in the center? I'll grant that it looks nice (a common white fence would have been a little boring), but it's ANOTHER unique piece to this set"
p1728
aS' The Build, 14 The very top of the castle is built separately'
p1729
aS' Not a whole lot to say here other than why is there a torch in an ICE CASTLE? The Finished Castle Once the roof is put on, the castle is done'
p1730
aS' And that big purple star on top says everything to me about the styling'
p1731
aS" It just doesn't look like modern Lego to me; it looks like this should be an old Belville fairy tale set from around 1999"
p1732
aS" If I saw a photo of just the castle with no figs (or picnic blanket), I'd assume that's what it was"
p1733
aS" The Oops, Not Actually Done Yet Accessories At the end, there's a few bits left to add"
p1734
aS' There are these dark purple skis (yup, another unique part) in the lower level'
p1735
aS" Let me tell you, they're a pain to get into that location, at least with my big man hands"
p1736
aS' More Accessories The top level gets a stickered book'
p1737
aS' The sticker has a nice castle image on it that is, while not quite exactly the castle from Disney World, VERY Disney-looking'
p1738
aS" I actually had to google and see if that's the castle they use in their logo"
p1739
aS" Nope, but it's the same style"
p1740
aS' The Leftovers There are a LOT of extra parts in this'
p1741
aS" That's almost 10% of the part count in the set right there! They are pretty useful overall though"
p1742
aS' It\'s great to have an extra "carrot" and brown "branch" for Olaf, since you know those will get lost as he\'s played with'
p1743
aS' The Figs Finally, the reason for the set'
p1744
aS" Let's face it, the castle set is just an excuse to make these figures"
p1745
aS" And they're GREAT"
p1746
aS' I mean just fantastic'
p1747
aS' The print on them is just such a good match to the real characters'
p1748
aS' Compare to the cartoon version from the front of the box'
p1749
aS" Elsa's hair is a little darker than the cartoon, but overall these are just dead on"
p1750
aS' If I had to pick out a flaw, it\'s the "spell" Elsa is holding'
p1751
aS" It's too bad she can only shoot it forward with her arm down like that"
p1752
aS" It'd be nice to have the end of the splash part bent 90 degrees so she can have her arm forward and the spell shooting forward too"
p1753
aS' Oh, one other thing'
p1754
aS" The minidoll heads don't press down tight to the body like minifig heads do"
p1755
aS" There's still exposed neck"
p1756
aS" It looks nice, but it means Elsa's cape can swing around"
p1757
aS" The Fig Backs Elsa's cape is glittery on the back and you can see the removable bow in her hair"
p1758
aS' The Full Set One final issue'
p1759
aS" When you put Anna on the sleigh, her cape doesn't have enough flexibility (since it's a wraparound kind) and so it folds out funny"
p1760
aS" That's why on the back of the box it shows her standing on the back of the sleigh with Elsa in the seat"
p1761
aS" Edit: How on earth did I forget to comment on those orange flowers to each side of the castle? I'm pretty sure Elsa did NOT have any flowers blooming outside her castle! The Conclusion Hm"
p1762
aS" I really wanted to like this set, but I just can't quite bring myself to"
p1763
aS' It feels like Lego pulled a random castle design from the files then redid it into white and trans blue to look icy and allow a Frozen tie in set'
p1764
aS" The figs are great, but the castle isn't"
p1765
aS' I guess the real castle in the movie would be a boring set and this one has play features, but it just is too different for my taste'
p1766
aS" The Ratings Value: 7/10 - $40 for less than 300 parts is high (especially when so many of the parts are tiny, but on the other hand there's a LOT of rock panels and 1x2x5 trans blue panels), but the figs help save it"
p1767
aS" Design: 4/10 - Not one of Lego's best"
p1768
aS' Not as bad as the lows in the 90s, but not a great set'
p1769
aS' Minifigs: 10/10 - Possibly even a 12/10'
p1770
aS' They ARE the reason to buy the set '
p1771
aS' Playability: 8/10 - There are a bunch of play features, but they actually detract from the design, so I had to knock off a couple points'
p1772
aS' Parts: 7/10 - A bunch of impractical unique parts (how often do you need dark purple skis or a lavender fence piece?) but also a bunch of nice parts if you wanted to make your own icy scene'
p1773
aS" Overall: 7/10 - A great bunch of figs, but I'd recommend not bothering with the manuals"
p1774
aS" Just use the parts to build your own castle that's better"
p1775
aS'Two of my daughters are building this as we speak'
p1776
aS" I agree the design is a lot smaller than I would have liked, but they're loving it"
p1777
aS' No question the figures are the real draw here'
p1778
aS" And at 6 and almost five years old they're doimg a good job building so far"
p1779
aS' At least for the 4-6 range in my house, this set is a home run'
p1780
aS' Thanks for the great review, Mostlytechnic!'
p1781
aS'I managed to get two sets for my twin girls for Christmas, and would have to agree with your ratings (the Anna and Elsa figs are indeed excellent)'
p1782
aS'Very nice review, mostlytechinc! Once I saw this set I was interested in it for the colours and pieces'
p1783
aS'thanks for this review to shed more light onto it!'
p1784
aS"Isn't getting parts in new colors a good thing? It is a shame there is only this one set, I think TLG could make a whole subtheme out of Frozen"
p1785
aS" I do agree that they overuse lavender and magenta, I don't see why every girl set has to have these sort of colors instead of what would be accurate to the source material "

p1788
aS' Sure, new colors are good'
p1789
aS" But cramming a bunch of oddball ones into a single set where they don't even make sense just seems financially unwise for Lego"
p1790
aS" I'd rather have seen a larger set than light aqua spiral staircase parts"
p1791
aS' Or lavender tiny fences'
p1792
aS" Lego made the stairs in dark purple last year for Rapunzel's Tower, and those probably would have been ok here"
p1793
aS' Or make them in a more useful color like WHITE'
p1794
aS'Thanks for the review mostlytechnic'
p1795
aS' I too wish they had done a real castle for this set, it certainly deserved it'
p1796
aS' My sons and I figure they could have used the old rock monster mold from Rock Raiders in white for the missing snow beast'
p1797
aS' I will pick it up though for the figs and unique pieces'
p1798
aS'Thanks for the review! I have the same opinion about the design, looks like Belville'
p1799
aS' I bought it on Legostore Orlando December 30th'
p1800
aS' It was impressive'
p1801
aS' My wife saw them putting on shelf, 8 or 10 boxes'
p1802
aS' She ran and grabbed the last one! The girls faces around it was indescribable, mix of ecstasy and afraid to loose it'
p1803
aS' It happened in less than 2 minutes'
p1804
aS" My 7 yo girl didn't want it"
p1805
aS' She likes the dresses but hates the movie'
p1806
aS' Prefers Lego Movie'
p1807
aS' But my 2 yo girl who never saw the movie grabbed it for good, and we bought it'
p1808
aS' Lego will sell it like water, but I do not understand why a set so small'
p1809
aS' It is the WORST SET DESIGN since the introduction of Lego Friends'
p1810
aS' My 7 yo has more than 50 Lego friends minifigures, all the Lego fiends stores and concluded that the castle had a terrible design'
p1811
aS" She is 7!! Let's be honest, Lego should have released this sets months before this Christmas and is loosing a perfect opportunity to sell a decent set, with much more pieces"
p1812
aS' I am wondering if they are going to make another set with the same characters'
p1813
aS' At the end,'
p1814
aS' It is just for the minifigures'
p1815
aS"When I first saw the pictures, I didn't realize that this set had so much color barf going on in it"
p1816
aS' Also, there is a bunch of stuff that does not fit in with the movie, and it is pricey'
p1817
aS' The minifigures are nice, but no Kristoff or Sven'
p1818
aS' I thought about getting this, but this review is pushing me towards no'
p1819
aS'Yep, my family all thinks they should have made a bigger set, added figs, and just been printing money'
p1820
aS' This feels massively rushed into production'
p1821
aS' Which is weird, the other princess sets that just came out look worlds better'
p1822
aS'I wish Elsa had more of a white hairpiece rather than blonde'
p1823
aS' But it could be worse'
p1824
aS" Not a bad set overall, although Olaf doesn't look right without the twigs on his head"
p1825
aS' Anna is a really nice and accurate fig'
p1826
aS'The review is very well done'
p1827
aS" Thanks! I don't know the movie"
p1828
aS' My key question is whether the bricks in the set will allow to build my own snow/ice creations'
p1829
aS' Now, with "trans-glitter" being part of the design approach I am not so sure'
p1830
aS' Can those who have already bought it tell me: can trans-glitter be used as "transparent with snow particles" or is it just terrible? I cannot really tell from the review pic above'
p1831
aS'I think the trans-glitter blue panels can be icy or snowy just fine'
p1832
aS" I'm sure that's WHY they used them for this set"
p1833
aS" Now, if you're looking for realism (like the photos in your sig seem to be), it might be tougher"
p1834
aS" But I've been thinking about using those big glittery panels to make a waterfall-type scene"
p1835
aS"I'm literally of the exact opposite opinion to OP here"
p1836
aS" I love the structure and the parts (this is a fantastic little parts pack that I'll be snagging more of when I find it again)"
p1837
aS"but I've no use for the figures (not a big Disney Princess fan)"
p1838
aS" It's all about the parts"
p1839
aS' This set is freaking amazing! :D'
p1840
aS"Well, the good news for you is you're in luck whenever you find sets, since the figs sell for a good bit of money :) Right now the bricklink value of the 3 figs is about $30!"

aS'There is a very simple reason for the flowers and green-leaved trees; you should remember from the movie it was actually summer when Elsa set of the eternal winter The orange flowers do bother me, from a design point of view; I would have liked it better if they were a pink/purple/blue/white color'
p1851
aS' Same goes for the leafy bits; they could have used the pink/purple ones they are gonna use in the Elves sets'
p1852

p1858

aS'Hello everyone, I am back to share with all of you, another of my Legends of Chima polybags review'
p1871
aS' It will be pretty comprehensive since the finished built will be quick and will be focusing more of what kind of fun that you can derive from there'
p1872
aS' This polybag was bought in September 2013, when I visited LEGOLAND Malaysia and I did not hesitate to put this in my shopping basket'
p1873
aS' Name: 30253 Leonidas Jungle Dragster Theme: LEGO System / Legends of Chima Year: 2013 Pieces: 30 Minifigs: 1 minifigure Price: USD N'
p1874
aS'A, GBP N'
p1875
aS'A, EURO N'
p1876
aS'A, SGD N'
p1877
aS'A Resources: Brickset, BrickLink An original polybag image of the 30253 Leonidas Jungle Dragster Back view of the original polybag image of the 30253 Leonidas Jungle Dragster The road scout of the Lions Tribe This polybag design is definitely plan to be the quickest and fastest dragster to recce enemy front by making a swift scout for the Lions Tribe'
p1878
aS' I believe by the sound of the name, Jungle Dragster, it might just be suitable to use in jungle terrain'
p1879
aS" Well, I don't quite agree that this is a 'Dragster' even though it has the kind of open view concept of rolling in fast but it does not have the length of a typical dragster, similar to this Town polybag design, for example"
p1880
aS' Still, it is nice to have smaller variants of their vehicular supremacy'
p1881
aS' Instruction Manual (Front) Instruction Manual (Back) The LEGO building content With just 30 LEGO elements, you can be pretty quick to be able to display these laid out content'
p1882
aS' After the built is completed, these are the remaining spare parts'
p1883
aS' I am fond of the wheels which are some useful parts, other than that, there are nothing spectacular about it'
p1884
aS' My name is Leonidas and I belonged to the Lions Tribe Do not be mistaken of his name, Leonidas to be the King of Sparta who led the brave men of 300 Spartans Warriors to fight to the death against the Persians'
p1885
aS' Instead this character is based on the bio resided in LEGO'
p1886
aS'com, you will realise that he is aligned with the Lions tribe and is a proud Lion foot-soldier'
p1887
aS' He may have that goofy idiotic look but he can be very serious in his commitment to discharging his duties'
p1888
aS' You are able to observe his nice back view printing which reveal his black and blue sash'
p1889
aS' Leonidas has a dual facial feature to reveal his much serious appearance'
p1890
aS' Leonidas is one of the common characters available in the Legends of Chima universe'
p1891
aS' It can be found in a total of five sets'
p1892
aS' It is a great pity that there is no weapon being made for him in this polybag design which will certainly make a fine addition'
p1893
aS' The completed built of the Jungle Dragster This is the main design of the Jungle Dragster which is very simple looking'
p1894
aS' There is no distinct fighting capability from the vehicular design and it look just like a regular patrol vehicle'
p1895
aS' One thing I like about this, is the close distinct colour schema of the Lions Tribe'
p1896
aS' Other than that, there is nothing special about it'
p1897
aS' Moving off with my Jungle Dragster To conclude, this polybag is really meant for LEGO fans or collectors who appreciate Legends of Chima or wanting to sample the Legends of Chima theme'
p1898
aS' It is a very simple built, but yet could form a decent force size for recce purposes before sending in the big arsenals to whack their enemies'

aS' Inside is plenty of space for two figures'
p2161
aS' The pod cleverly attaches by pushing the front section of the ship forward, sliding the pod in, then returning the front'

aS' Everything locks together and is held securely in place by an elastic band'
p2163
aS" :-) Here's a couple of pictures of the final model"
p2164
aS" It's not the most beautiful creation ever, but it is an excellent representation of the ship from the film"
p2165
aS' The angular shape actually suits a LEGO build well'
p2166
aS" There's one more useful feature"
p2167
aS' The whole ship can be safely and comfortably picked up by two ball ended Technic pins towards the back end'
p2168
aS' It balances well at this point and does allow you to swoosh the ship around much more easily'
p2169
aS" This was the most enjoyable Star Wars build I've had in a long time"
p2170
aS' Everything progresses nicely with almost no repetitive bits'
p2171
aS" The ship looks good and is also HUGE! *sweet* Compare it to the 6211 ISD and you'll see it's only fractionally smaller"
p2172
aS' When I first saw pictures of this on the internet I thought it looked OK'
p2173
aS' Once you see it for real it is much more impressive'
p2174
aS' For ?69'

aS' Yeah, nude swoosh On X-D! Excellent review! This looks like a very nice piece of LEGO-enginereing *y*! Like you I think it looks like the original'
p2185
aS' I did think though that it was supposed to be a un-armed ship but I can defenitly live with that X-D! The escape shuttle looks roamy enough, a bit dull though but it could have a PS III stached away somewhere, but the other shuttle :-| - come on! Is it for Mini-me when he needs to go and get some burgers & fries? Getting at least two On copmike'

p2325
aS" After a late night of building Sunday evening, I couldn't wait to take some pictures and post a review on EB"
p2326
aS' So here it is: ------------------------------------- SET DETAILS ------------------------------------- Theme: Castle 2007 Set Name: Skeleton Ship Attack Number: 7029 Pieces: 628 Price: $69'
p2327
aS'99 (USD) ------------------------------------- THE SKELETON SHIP ------------------------------------- The box, excellent imagery boasting "Special Edition": The back of box'
p2328
aS' Once again, no alternate models: Two sets of instructions'
p2329
aS' Bags are numbered: The ship'
p2330
aS" My first observation was that it could be longer or have an aft section, but it isn't too bad: The front: The front contains a rubber band operated cannon like the Crossbow Catapult"
p2331
aS' It actually works pretty well: The hull/aft section'
p2332
aS' The entry is open with no doors'
p2333
aS" I think the bone pieces may be glow-in-the-dark but I haven't tested yet"
p2334
aS' The chest contains 4 standard gold coins: '
p2335
aS' I like the sides of the ship with the window pieces and shilds'
p2336
aS' The plank lifts inward: The mast is securely attached with a technic beam; and the top of the cabin is removable: The aft'
p2337
aS' It has the new castle lightning bolt pieces: Crows nest with red sail: Removing the cabin reveals a smaller cargo level with a mouse/rat: The sail'
p2338
aS' Mine was rather wrinkled in the box and it does not hang very well'
p2339
aS' I do like the pattern/design: And the last image of the ship, the top of the cabin removed'
p2340
aS' This is a great playability feature: ----------------------- ON TO THE CASTLE ----------------------- The front'
p2341
aS' It is built with three sections: 1) middle bridge section, 2) right building structure, 3) left catapult cave: Starting with the building section: The roof lifts to reveal my favorite part of the castle'
p2342
aS' It includes a small table, chicken/turkey leg, barrel, short sword, and gold goblet: The catapult cave section'
p2343
aS' The catapult rotates 360 degrees'
p2344
aS' The chest contains three colored gems: The back side: The bridge (middle section): A sliding mechanism pulls out allowing four brown tiles to collapse when pulling'
p2345
aS' More planks would have made the feature better (kind of like the Tygura Adventurers set): The middle section'
p2346
aS' I love the knight shield: A closer perspective: The back of the middle section: The knights'
p2347
aS' No new torsos, faces, or weapons: The skeletons'
p2348
aS" I really like the skeleton captain with beard and pirate hat: And lastly, the set includes two new silver orbs (for the catapult), and two projectiles for the ship's gun: ------------ SUMMARY ------------ LIKES: I like the combination of the skeleton ship and castle wall"
p2349
aS' I regret taking apart my castle to see how this new castle section could have been added'
p2350
aS' The set offers much playability with seven figs, accessible structures, and detailed accessories (two chests, crate, goblet, gold, gems, and barrel)'
p2351
aS' Most of all, I like the thought of a castle on the sea with the doc'
p2352
aS" DISLIKES: Right after opening the box, I found the ship's sail rolled up and wrinkled"
p2353
aS' This is very disappointing'
p2354
aS' I may write Lego and ask for a replacement'
p2355
aS" I'm not sure if these can be ironed or flattened some how"
p2356
aS' In addition, lately all my set instructions have been badly wrinkled'
p2357
aS' Lego needs to pack these in boxes better o that they stay flat'
p2358
aS' Perhaps the paper is a little thinner too adding to the issue'
p2359
aS' The ship could have been longer with a molded back end (as mentioned above), but it still looks pretty good'
p2360
aS' I would prefer a smaller closed castle structure as opposed to a wall, but the sections that can be disattached are nice (esp'
p2361
aS' the building structure)'
p2362
aS' I think the price is a little too much for the # of pieces (many small), and the box way too large'
p2363
aS" It really isn't much after building the set"
p2364
aS' ------------------- FINAL THOUGHT ------------------- This is probably the better of most of the new Castle theme sets but it is still a bit like Knights Kingdom'
p2365
aS' I would buy this set again for the likes mentioned above'
p2366
aS" I'm not sure how I plan to use this set as I don't want to rebuild the large castle any time soon, but it is a nice stand alone set with a lot of playability"
p2367
aS' Hope you enjoy the review'
p2368
aS"Heh, those orbs aren't new- they're silver Zamor spheres from 2006 ;-) Nice review, it's quite a nice little set"

aS" I don't like it, especially the stern"
p2382
aS' TLC could have done a better job, but the sail is good, I like how its tethered'
p2383
aS' EDIT: I see your sail was wrinkled'
p2384
aS' If it is a canvas material like the old school pirate sails, you can iron it'
p2385
aS' I have done that before, and it makes the sails like new'

p2390
aS" It's a shame that in Italy it costs 70 Euro, while in most European countries it's marked at 60 Euro, which I consider the prefect price for this set"
p2391
aS" Still, this doesn't make me removing this set from my wishlist"
p2392
aS' :-) Believe it or not, this is going to be my first pirate ship! I hope that in the future Lego will make more ships for the Castle theme'
p2393
aS' Shakar'

p2395
aS" Is there anything beside the rat in the ship's cargo hold?"
p2396
aS'Thank you very much for that neat review, Brickster'
p2397
aS' *y* I too think that ironing with very low heat could work fine, perhaps if you put the sail between two sheets of white paper or so to protect it'
p2398
aS' A very good set IMO, that little house and the grotto?re really lovely'
p2399
aS' Frog on! :-) I instantly bought two of them and i?ll try to MOD a second half for the house and also a more decent ship with those additional hull pieces'
p2400
aS' I also think to MOD the King?s Castle if I get it'
p2401
aS' Maybe I?ll extend it?s backside to a little harbor'
p2402
aS" :'-) The only thing I despise is that my treasure chest came in two slight different shades of brown"
p2403
aS' :-| EDIT: @Yoda: The MF you mentioned is correct according to the instructions, but different in the box pictures'
p2404
aS' I think the box pictures?re more fitting, the archer looks more proper with that belt across his chest'

p2407
aS' Tks for the clarification ;-) I only based my post on all the other sets I have'
p2408
aS' Weird that they decided to change the MF in that set in particular'
p2409
aS' For army building purpose, I shall keep the box pic archer - to have the same colour MFs ;-) *yoda*'
p2410
aS"Thank you for the neat review, good, clear pictures, nice description *y* :-) I quite like this set, it's a good army building, castle extending set, as all ready mentioned I would love to get this set but I'm saving money for the Hoth battlleset and I'm really happy with the smaller Castle sets :-)"

aS'Asuka, on Jul 31 2007, 10:30 AM, said: I too think that ironing with very low heat could work fine, perhaps if you put the sail between two sheets of white paper or so to protect it'
p2412
aS' you have iron paper ??? that sounds dangerous !!! i have ironed many pirate sails'
p2413
aS' i usually run them underwater to loosen them up, especially if there is a hard fold im looking to remove'
p2414
aS' then i put a towel over the side of the sail that im ironing'
p2415
aS' it seems there is some plastic coating over the sails, so the towel keeps the sail from melting or buring'
p2416
aS' medium/high temperature has worked for me'
p2417
aS' -------------------------------------------------- as for the set, the thing that jumps out at me most is the use of dark blue for water'
p2418
aS' im so used to seeing the classic blue for water, that the dark blue seems weird'
p2419
aS" i don't like it"
p2420
aS' - BM Edited by Brick Miner, 31 July 2007 - 07:48 PM'

aS' - BM Indeed, I only noticed this when I saw the S@H images'
p2427
aS" I guees that they're on dark waters"
p2428
aS' You can always put some trans blue and trans clear 1x1 round plates, no? I tried that technique to make the lava (using trans red and trans orange plates), it looks neat'
p2429
aS" Regarding the human soldier thing Yoda mentioned, it's quite weird"
p2430
aS" Like him, I'm going to swap the legs, so they're coherent with the soldiers from the other sets"
p2431
aS' Third note: is it just me or did you attach the two black gate pieces too high? Shakar'
p2432

p2434
aS' The upper plate with clip for the door is a little high, on top of a dark gray 1x1 brick'
p2435
aS' So if you want the door to operate well you have to place it like that'
p2436
aS' I just put the clip under that brick, a very easy fix, so my door now is lower which looks better IMHO, and no sneaky skelly can crawl along under it'
p2437
aS' X-D'
p2438
aS'Not sure I like this one much'
p2439

p2446
aS' Asuka is correct'
p2447
aS' Also keep in mind that the picture was taken looking down on the model that is sitting on the carpet'
p2448
aS' It makes the gap appear a little larger'
p2449
aS' In addition; for those of you that recommended ironing the sail, it worked great'
p2450
aS' I set the iron to low and used a t-shirt to protect the sail'
p2451
aS' It flattened it out perfectly'
p2452
aS' In fact, it worked so well, that I did the same with my old WW Weapons Wagon cover that has gotten wrinkled over the years'
p2453
aS' The iron worked perfectly'
p2454
aS'Yes, that was definately an optic illusion'
p2455
aS' Looking at it again, the gap looks a lot shorter'
p2456
aS' Thanks'
p2457
aS' :-) Shakar'
p2458
aS'Yes, very nice review Mr Brickster! I think I , for a change, like the castle part better'
p2459
aS" The ship doesn't look quite right to me"
p2460
aS" If they're gonna make a pirate theme with ships like this I wouldn't be very happy"
p2461
aS' But I think the ship brings some nice accesories'
p2462
aS' Like the anchor, a black mid piece(!), steering wheel etc'

p2475
aS'Ok here is the set alot of us star wars fans have been waiting for! The 7666 Hoth Rebel Base! *wub* First the box Now the great minifigs! That stunning K-3po fig! Now the snowspeeder! AAAAGGGHHHHH these parts are all stickers! Now for the turret! the 2 cones on the side press in to fire out 2 blue lights saber blades :-D Now for the small crane thingy'
p2476
aS' Yes the part under the engine on the snowspeeder is another sticker 8-| Echo Base!! (well the front door anyway :-D ) The main control room? :-D Again these are stickers on a tinted clear panel and on the slope |-/ I have no idea what this is meant to be! :-D Finally 2 shots of the full set! *wub* Well over all i really like this set and think it is great value for money'
p2477
aS' The minifigs alone would set you back more than the cost of this set'
p2478
aS' The build time was a good 2 hours or so and was good fun! The snowspeeder is not as good as the second snowspeeder and no where near as good as the first in my opinion, but i did love that first one'
p2479
aS" The k-3po fig is perfect and it is good to be getting more droids that aren't r2-d2 and c-3po"
p2480
aS' It is a shame about the stickers but that is the price of keeping the cost down i suppose (the only printed part in the whole set is the snowspeeder/x-wing windscreen)'
p2481
aS' I will definately be getting atleast another 3 of this great set'
p2482
aS' 9/10'
p2483

p2496
aS' a very playable set, really nice'
p2497
aS' For the Snowspeeder, I prefer the main gun design of its predecessor, but the grappling hook gun is a good improvement'

aS' The snowspeeder is far better than the first they realized (but only one thing: it looks a bit too white to me'

aS'REVIEW - 42039 - 24 HOURS RACE CAR INTRODUCTION When the preliminary images of the "Le Mans Racer" surfaced somewhere last year (2014) it got a lot of praise'
p2540
aS' This changed dramatically when the final images of the 24 Hours Race Car showed up'
p2541
aS' The front side of the car, especially the head lights, and the curvature of the side of car had changed a lot'
p2542
aS' The car obviously still resembled the prototype, but the new design raised a lot of eyebrows'
p2543
aS' The new design was considered a step back instead of forward'
p2544
aS' Eventhough I still liked the design, I must admit I liked the earlier design better too'
p2545
aS' With the emphasis on past tense liked'
p2546
aS' I am not sure anymore and this review will show you why'
p2547
aS' Like the Arctic Truck this set has a B-model which is well worth checking out'
p2548
aS" That's why this review includes both the A-model and B-model"
p2549
aS' For people who are on the fence, the B-model might actually convince them to buy the set after all'
p2550
aS" Let's see what this set is all about! Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions"

aS'082 Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX The box measures 47,8 cm x 37,3 cm x 8,7 cm and weighs well over 2kg (2110 gr to be precise)'
p2556
aS' The width of the box is the same as the box of the Arctic Truck'
p2557
aS" This box also feels like it's filled to the brim"
p2558
aS' THE FRONT The front shows a picture of the main model in action, with radial blurred wheels to emphasize the motion of the car'
p2559
aS' The lower right section shows the dimensions of the model'
p2560
aS' Upon completion, it will measure a length of 40cm and a width of 18 cm'
p2561
aS' THE BACK Like the front, the back side has exactly the same setup as the box of the Arctic Truck'
p2562
aS' The top shows the functions of the model, while the lower left side shows the B-model and the lower right side shows the motorization options'
p2563
aS" The picture of the B-model looks so cool, it could be a model of it's own"
p2564
aS' At this point I was very eager to build both models and compare them'
p2565
aS' THE SIDE One of the sides usually shows a part in 1:1 scale'
p2566
aS" This time it's one of the wheels indicating the size of the model"
p2567
aS' CONTENT OF THE BOX The box contains: 1 Book(let) 1 Sticker Sheet 13 Bags 4 Tires INSTRUCTION BOOKLET Since I own two copies of the set, I also received two instruction booklets'
p2568
aS" What's catching my eye is that my second copy is supplied in different packaging than the first one"
p2569
aS" It's for the first time (that I am aware of) that the instruction booklet and stickers come in a sealed bag, without cardboard back"
p2570
aS' Hopefully this will be a new standard for all sets with sticker sheets'
p2571
aS' Instead of multiple booklets, this set contains a single square bound book'
p2572
aS' In earlier reviews I have epxressed my preference for a single book'
p2573
aS" I don't see any advantage in having 2, 3 or even up to 6 booklets"
p2574
aS' STICKER SHEET Like the actual model, the sticker sheet looks very vibrant'
p2575
aS" The bright green, white and black color combination has found it's way to the stickers as well"
p2576
aS" Either you love 'em or hate 'em"
p2577
aS' Since I started writing reviews I have been applying stickers and I am happy I started doing it'
p2578
aS" Stickers do give the model it's finishing touch"
p2579
aS' BAGS WITH PARTS Thirteen bags with a total of 1219 parts (give or take a few) are supplied in the densily packed box'
p2580
aS' The rims and flex are sealed in a bag as well'
p2581
aS' Sometimes looking at the bags makes you wonder what the logic is, behind the distribution of the various parts across the different bags'
p2582
aS' Well this time it really got me confused'
p2583
aS' Take a look at two of the bags below'
p2584
aS" There's a bag containing all the 3L Blue Pins"
p2585
aS" Then there's a bag with various parts"
p2586
aS'and a single 3L Blue Pin'
p2587
aS' I figured this might be an error, but both of the sets have the same anomaly'
p2588
aS' TIRES The tires have been supplied unbagged, as usual'
p2589
aS' HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This chapter describes new and interesting parts'
p2590
aS' This set actually contains a lot of them'
p2591
aS' This set also contains an abundance of panels'
p2592
aS" If you aren't into panels, this isn't the set for you"
p2593
aS' CHANGEOVER CATCH This year (2015) the new changeover catch parts were released'
p2594
aS" It's a combination of three parts"
p2595
aS' The advantage of the new parts is that the red gear is the same on both sides, which avoids mounting it the wrong way around'
p2596
aS' It also avoids the changeover catch slipping out of the driving ring, like it used to do'
p2597
aS" You can apply lots of pressure, but the catch doesn't slip out"
p2598
aS" PINS Some of last year's new pins are also included in this set"
p2599
aS' 12 x Pin with Pin Hole and 21 x 3L Pin with 1L Axle'
p2600
aS' Securing Technic Beams can be quite simple with the new Pin with Pin Holes'
p2601
aS' The new 3L Pin with 1L Axle gives you more possibilities when connecting Beams and other parts'
p2602
aS' Below are two example situations where the new pins have been used'
p2603
aS' Granted, the examples below can be accomplished by using other techniques'
p2604
aS' However, some predicaments from the past can be easily solved by using these new parts'
p2605
aS' Like me, you will most likely appreciate the ease of use'
p2606
aS' ENGINE AND SUSPENSION Also included are two Steering Portal Hubs and Steering Portal Hubs with Ball Joint Arms and four Steering Portal Axles for driving and steering the vehicle'
p2607
aS' These parts are commonly used nowadays'
p2608
aS' The picture below also shows some other parts, like gear rack, steering arms and suspension'
p2609
aS' FRAMES This set comes with a single 5x7 Frame and three 5x11 Frames'
p2610
aS' PANELS This set contains a whopping 47 panels in three different colors'
p2611
aS' I personally like panels a lot and I do appreciate the variety we have at our disposal lately'
p2612
aS' This set even contains a new 13x3x2 Curved "Mudguard" Panel'
p2613
aS' NEW 13x3x2 CURVED PANEL This is the first set to contain the new 13x3x2 Curved Panel'
p2614
aS" Looking at the pictures doesn't do these panels justice"
p2615
aS' In real life they are actually quite big'
p2616
aS' I figured they would be smaller, but they are even longer than the 11 x 5 frame, with a length of 13 (including the attachment points)'
p2617
aS' Hopefully this part will be available in other colors as well, preferably white, for adding variety to your EV3 robot'
p2618
aS' 19L WHITE FLEX-AXLES The White 19L Flex Axles have only been released in a single set, the 8461 Williams F1 Racer in 2002'
p2619
aS' Current prices on Bricklink are as high as 15 Euros! Needless to say we are very happy with the return of these White Axles'
p2620
aS" Now we can build Jeroen Ottens' awesome Alfa Romeo 4C Spider for a decent price as well"
p2621
aS" I am really happy that useful rare parts are being used more often by TLG designers PART LIST Here's the complete list for all 1219 parts"
p2622
aS' As you can see in the Highlighted parts section, this set contains a lot of interesting and useful parts'
p2623
aS" If you don't own sets like the 8070 - Supercar, this might be the set to pick up if you want to start building your own supercar"
p2624
aS" THE BUILD Enough with all the set and part information, let's build the model"
p2625
aS' REAR SUSPENSION The build starts with the rear suspension and drivetrain'
p2626
aS' As you can see in the picture below, the length of the Axle between the Steering CV Joint is 4L, where it usally is 3L'
p2627
aS' This is an indication that the finished model will be a bit bigger than usual (8070 for example)'
p2628
aS' The finished suspension is one of the cleanest suspension setups I have seen in an official model'
p2629
aS" It's pretty basic, but it works like a charm"
p2630
aS' This setup is defintely worth using in your MOC'
p2631
aS" Here's a video: After attaching the suspension to the frame you rotate the module and secure it"
p2632
aS' At this stage the rear section of the chassis with suspension is almost finished'
p2633
aS' V8 MID-ENGINE Extending the chassis forward results in the picture below, where the front spoiler is already visible'
p2634
aS" What's also visible is the V8 engine placed right in front of the rear axle, resulting in a Mid-engine setup, perfectly suited for sports and race cars"
p2635
aS' Two exhaust pipes have been fitted on either side of the engine, together with two hoses attaching them to the engine'
p2636
aS' The instructions are easy to follow, although you sometimes you need to bend the beams a bit'
p2637
aS' Minor improvements are possible here and there, but nothing shocking'
p2638
aS' FRONT SUSPENSION The front suspension is a bit more complicated than the rear suspension, which makes sense considering the fact it contains the steering rack'
p2639
aS' The shock absorbers are placed in a different angle than the rear ones, resulting in a somewhat stiffer front suspension'
p2640
aS' All in all the front suspension is well designed and the steering rack can be easily powered with a Servo Motor'
p2641
aS' The picture belows shows the front suspension attached to the chassis'
p2642
aS' If you follow the official instructions to motorize the model, the area in front of the suspension is used to mount the battery box'
p2643
aS' When you are modding this model to make it Full RC this area can be used to mount the servo motor'
p2644
aS" GEARBOX Like the gearbox in the 8070, it's not used to switch gears powering the drivetrain"
p2645
aS" It's used to switch between two functions, opening the doors and the hood/bonnet"
p2646
aS' The gearbox is located at the left of the vehicle, near the cockpit'
p2647
aS' The mechanism to open the doors is located on the left side, while opening the hood/bonnet is taking place at the right side'
p2648
aS' To accomplish this, some axles traverse under the cockpit to the other side of the vehicle'
p2649
aS' Following the axles to other side of the vehicle and adding some gears, results in the situation below'
p2650
aS' The video below shows the gearbox in action'
p2651
aS' DOOR OPENING MECHANISM The mechanism to open the door is comprised of some Knob Wheels, Links without Stoppers and Pins with Towballs'
p2652
aS' Take a look at the doors opening and closing'
p2653
aS' THE FRONT Using the new mudguards and various other panels you finish the front of the car'
p2654
aS' The front is probably the most controversial part of the car'
p2655
aS' This is caused by the preliminary pictures shown before the release of this car'
p2656
aS' In the early pictures the front of the car had smooth curves and beautiful lines, while the final car lost these smooth lines and got a more blocky look in return'
p2657
aS" I must admit that at a first glance, the new design lost some of it's appeal"
p2658
aS' However, this model grew on me pretty rapidly'
p2659
aS' The headlight design can be found, in more or less the same way, on several real Le Mans type race cars'
p2660
aS' THE REAR The rear of the car looks great, with the stickers continuing from the mudguards to the panels underneath the spoiler'
p2661
aS' The two exhausts sticking out give some details to the back'
p2662
aS' I absolutely disagree with all the negativity surrounding this car'
p2663
aS" Maybe it's one of those models which needs to grow on you"
p2664
aS' FINISHED MODEL Here it is, the finished model'
p2665
aS" I know some of you don't like the looks of the car, but I think it looks great"
p2666
aS' The color scheme is outstanding'
p2667
aS' The new (for Technic) bright green parts, combined with white and black make this car look very vibrant and colorful'
p2668
aS' I am not a big fan of the green used in the 42008 - Service Truck, but I do like this bright green a lot'
p2669
aS' It fits perfectly well with the Mindstorms EV3 set'
p2670
aS' The curves on the side of the car are not as smooth as some of us hoped, but I still think the car looks more than acceptable from the side'
p2671
aS' The stickers add some nice details to the car, giving it that characteristic race car look'
p2672
aS' The model looks great in pictures, but it does even look better in real life'
p2673
aS' I love this picture of the front of the car'
p2674
aS" However, I do wonder if a dedicated 24 hour Le Mans Racer has the seat and steering positioned off-center?! Using the good ol' Google Machine I come to the conclusion that they do have centered seating and steering, at least the majority of them"
p2675
aS" There's ample space in the cabin, which makes me wonder why TLG decided to place the seat off-centered"
p2676
aS' The rear view looks cool too, with some of the suspension showing and the two exhaust pipes clearly visible'
p2677
aS' The bottom view is very useful to determine the size of the car in studs'
p2678
aS' It measures approx 59 x 27 studs'
p2679
aS' The chassis looks organized and well designed'
p2680
aS' The engine has been placed close to the ground, which is perfect for the weight distribution'
p2681
aS' A low center of gravity improves the handling of the car'
p2682
aS' I really enjoyed building this baby'
p2683
aS' The build is very clean and organized, although there are some steps where you need to bend the beams a bit to get things into place'
p2684
aS' Seeing the model come to life and seeing it grow to pretty impressive proportions is very satisfying'
p2685
aS' For me it was fun, but I reckon kids will go nuts over this set and the build'
p2686
aS" SIZE COMPARISON What became obvious during the build, but what's emphasized when you have finished the model, is that it's quite big! The size of the car is pretty impressive"
p2687
aS' The pictures below show the car next to the 42030 - Volvo L350F'
p2688
aS' The side view emphasizes the size of the car'
p2689
aS" It's even longer than the Volvo, if you dismiss the bucket"
p2690
aS' PARTS LEFT Some parts left'
p2691
aS' Nothing out of the ordinary'
p2692
aS" FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS Unlike the B-model, this model doesn't implement any unexpected features"
p2693
aS' The functions it does implement are exactly what you would expect from any car'
p2694
aS" Steering (HoG) Working fake engine Suspension Opening doors (gullwing style) Opening bonnet/hood Opening trunk Gearbox for switching between functions Unfortunately the steering wheel hasn't been linked to the HoG (Hand of God) steering mechanism"
p2695
aS' Placing the seat in the center would have provided an easy way to link the steering wheel to the steering mechanism'
p2696
aS" it's a shame we hardly see actual steering anymore"
p2697
aS' Opening the hood actually opens up the entire rear section of the car, providing you with easy access to the motor compartment'
p2698
aS' The mechanism to open the hood works properly, which results in smooth opening and closing of it'
p2699
aS' The same goes for the gullwing style doors'
p2700
aS' Both functions are operated manually and you need to switch with the lever to the left of the cockpit'
p2701
aS' These two functions are also the ones which can be motorized by placing an M-motor near the cockpit and a battery box in the trunk'
p2702
aS' All things considered I think this car offers lots of playability'
p2703
aS' The model is solidly built and the functions are easy to operate'
p2704
aS" I'd say it's pretty safe to let your kids play with it"
p2705
aS' B-MODEL Unlike the A-model, the B-model for this set received (almost) universal acclaim, and I can see why'
p2706
aS" Often the B-model is a pale shadow of it's part donor"
p2707
aS" In this case the model looks so good, it could be a model of it's own"
p2708
aS' It even incorporates a neat feature, which actually deserves to be in the A-model'
p2709
aS" There's a lot a variation in the quality of digital building instructions TLG is providing, but these ones are of very high quality"
p2710
aS' The picture below shows most of the chassis with suspension, fake engine and gearbox in place'
p2711
aS' FINISHED MODEL Some concessions have been made, but overall the car looks fantastic'
p2712
aS' The black of the roof has been extrapolated from the hood, which definitely works for me'
p2713
aS" The rear section of the car feels a bit empty, but the panels do cover up most of it, so it's hardly noticeable"
p2714
aS' The V8 stickers will be upside down if you use the parts from the A-model'
p2715
aS' Since I could apply new stickers, I have placed them using the proper orientation'
p2716
aS' The bottom of the car shows the chassis'
p2717
aS" It's obviously a bit smaller than the A-model's chassis"
p2718
aS" FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS Taking the functions into account, this model isn't playing second fiddle to the A-model"
p2719
aS' Besides the obvious functions like steering, opening doors and hood, this car features folding fog lights, which deserve a better podium than a B-model'
p2720
aS' Steering (Hog) Working fake engine Suspension Opening doors (manually) Opening hood/bonnet (manually) Opening trunk (operated by gear) Folding fog lights (operated by gear) Gearbox (used to switch functions) FOG LIGHTS One of the most interesting features of the B-model are the folding Fog Lights'
p2721
aS' It almost feels a bit weird that a feature like this is implemented in the B-model, instead of the A-model'
p2722
aS' Below are 4 steps showing how the mechanism works'
p2723
aS' I have also included a video'
p2724
aS" The mechanism is somewhat reminiscent of fork mechanism used in the 8109 - Flatbed Truck, which has been described in Efferman's Review"
p2725
aS' Take a look at the video to the fog lights in action'
p2726
aS" PARTS LEFT A fair number of parts left, which isn't uncommon for a B-model"
p2727
aS' SUMMARY To summarize how I feel about this set, you need to take a look at the picture below'
p2728
aS' The combined image reflects the quality of this set'
p2729
aS'or better yet'
p2730
aS'sets! You actually get two great models, for the price of one'
p2731
aS" You don't like the A-model? No problem, you can have lots of fun with the B-model"
p2732
aS" I can't stop playing with the fog lights, it's mesmarizing"
p2733
aS' The color scheme on both models is outstanding'
p2734
aS" I simply can't emphasize enough how well this color scheme pleases the eye"
p2735
aS' The regular green is dull and boring, but this bright green really pops out, especially when combined with black and white, and possibly some red details'
p2736
aS' Black, white and a little red?! Sounds familiar? Yes, bright green can easily be combined with your EV3 robots'
p2737
aS' So while you are combining the bright green with your robot, why not use the great new curved "mudguard" panels'
p2738
aS' These new panels are introduced in this set and they look great'
p2739
aS' They open up a lot of possibilities in the design department'
p2740
aS' The build of the A-model is outstanding'
p2741
aS" It is fairly simple, but since it's so clean, I really enjoyed it a lot"
p2742
aS" I think the build should be entertaining, which doesn't mean it needs to be a real challenge"
p2743
aS" And let's be honest; when is a build really challenging?! The rear suspension is a good example of why I liked the build"
p2744
aS" It's very simple, yet very effective"
p2745
aS' Works like a charm'
p2746
aS' The same goes for the other functions in both models'
p2747
aS' And the star of the entire show can be found in the B-model'
p2748
aS" How's that for a surprise?! Being aware of the fact that I like this model a lot better than most of you seem to do, I really encourage you to give this model a chance"
p2749
aS' The sheer size is impressive, the color scheme is awesome and you get a bonus model, which is actually worth building'
p2750
aS' SCORE Okay, so how do I grade this set? 8 DESIGN Open to debate, but I like it a lot'
p2751
aS' 8 BUILDING EXPERIENCE Fun and clean build'
p2752
aS' 9 FEATURES Superb function in B-model steels the show'
p2753
aS' 9 PLAYABILITY Both models offer lots of playability 8 PARTS Lots of new parts and cool existing parts'
p2754
aS' 10 VALUE FOR MONEY Two models for the price of one'
p2755
aS' 8,7 TWICE THE FUN I hope you enjoyed this review! More pictures can be found on my Flickr page'
p2756
aS'Outstanding review Jim, congrats ! Love the pictures, so clean and crisp '
p2757
aS' Hope to see many more of your reviews'
p2758
aS' As for the set, after seeing this review I kind of like it, if I will find it at a decent price, I will get it for sure'
p2759
aS'Jim, great review as always'
p2760
aS' You convinced me to get this one of these days, although not a to priority'
p2761
aS' Any comments on which functions can be converted to PF and how well they work?'

p2765
aS' I will post a picture of the setup I have so far'
p2766
aS' This setup is for driving the chassis and it works pretty fine!'
p2767
aS'Thanks for a great review'
p2768
aS" I've got a pile of TRU and Lego credit I wanna spend and was thinking about getting this (since I got a sneak peak of your review in the Academy) but it's not here in the US yet"
p2769
aS' Too bad'
p2770
aS" Wonder when it'll hit? I do disagree about the manuals though"
p2771
aS' I find the thinner, stapled manuals easier to use than single large square-bound ones since they lay flatter when open'
p2772
aS" Have any links to the prelim photos of the front end? I don't remember seeing that and was curious how different it looked"

p2783
aS'Great review,I am still undecided whether to get this set or not'
p2784
aS'Really thorough review, Jim'
p2785
aS' I am super jealous that you have 2 of these and I have none, with no opportunity to get one any time soon'
p2786
aS'Great review'
p2787
aS' I see now why the B model is so popular'
p2788
aS' I wonder though, on the car, if instead of the panels for the rear spolier (or wing) if they could have used studded panels and maybe layer them to give the appearance of, ie: a three element rear wing'
p2789
aS" I won't mention the front lights"
p2790
aS' If I had the money I would buy it for the B model'
p2791
aS' H'
p2792
aS'Great review Jim and stunning pictures'
p2793
aS'I think this set will be my next purchase'
p2794
aS' I love the color scheme and indeed it looks like a nice set'
p2795
aS' Also 1200 parts for EUR 100 is not a bad deal'
p2796
aS' And yes, the looks of the car have really grown on my since the first official pictures appeared'
p2797
aS" I'm curious how the bright green will work combined with other colors than white"
p2798
aS' I really hope more sets in the future will use the color (so that more different parts will be available over time)'
p2799
aS" I think I'm the only person on Eurobricks who doesn't like the looks of the B model, but I appreciate the extra functionality it offers"
p2800
aS' Besides the set itself, I think this is one of the best reviews I have read in a while'
p2801
aS' Great job on the superb photographs (which I think are essential to a review) and the extensiveness of it all'
p2802
aS' You really touched every subject, which is great :D'
p2803
aS'I think I read somewhere that the US will not get this set or the motorcycle until August 2015'
p2804
aS" That means the flagship most likely won't be in August but even later in the year"
p2805
aS" nothing Bricklink can't solve though"
p2806
aS'Fantastic review Jim, from the quality of the review alone it is easy to see how much hard work you have put into it'
p2807
aS" I'm with you on the instruction manual, I much prefer one quality bound book over umpteen stapled booklets"
p2808
aS" Already have 2 of these sitting in the build queue, one for display model as I'm a fan of this one and one to build the B model then dissemble for parts, so I'm already sold on his set but still very much enjoyed taking the time it deserves to read through the review and ogle at your pro photography"
p2809
aS'Great review with fantastic pictures'
p2810
aS" As for the model, I'm glad that they chose to make it less pretty - real Le Mans prototypes are rarely a sight to behold"
p2811
aS' It is function and aerodynamics over form'
p2812
aS" I would, however, have preferred more realism for the sake of learning: - The front shouldn't open like that - instead it should be easy to remove the whole front cover, leaving the suspension easy to work on"
p2813
aS" - The aero seems to be realistic, except for the rear end where there's no indication of a venturi channel"
p2814
aS' This should have been easy to include'
p2815
aS' - There is no fuel tank, nor fixed fuel connector right behind the cabin'
p2816
aS' - There are no air jacks! Seriously!? This is one of the most unique features of a race car like this'
p2817
aS' and LEGO forgot about them'
p2818
aS' Instead they automated two functions which are manual on a real race car'
p2819
aS' - The top cars at Le Mans are hybrids with ingenious systems'
p2820
aS' I would have loved to see the front wheels connected to some kind of spinning apparatus indicating a kinetic energy recovery system'
p2821
aS' If I get this set'
p2822
aS" I'm going to make some modifications"
p2823
aS'This is a mega review'
p2824
aS" You've taken the right pictures and the video demonstrations of the mechanisms really help get the good points of the set across"
p2825
aS" What's more amazing is that the review still feels very concise and to the point"
p2826
aS" You've actually convinced me to put this set on my list and not just as a decent parts pack"

aS' I would have loved to see the front wheels connected to some kind of spinning apparatus indicating a kinetic energy recovery system'
p2836
aS" I'm not sure air jacks are the feature that will have people fawning over this set, and pneumatics are being covered rather well later in the year "
p2837
aS' but I agree with everything else, most notably removable front and rear bodywork (the removable engine cover on 8674 would be a good starting point here) and the inclusion of some nod towards a hybrid system'
p2838
aS" It's also worth remembering the preliminary design did have the Big Honking Fin (BHF) that is mandatory on all current prototypes, so maybe when that was removed any trace of a tunnel or diffuser went with it"
p2839
aS' On the subject of steering wheels, all modern prototypes actually have left or right hand drive'
p2840
aS' The regulations demand that both LMP1 and LMP2 cars are nominally capable of seating two people'
p2841
aS' Of course in practise the "extra seat" is taken up by the hybrid system in LMP1 and electronics/extra cockpit access in LMP2'
p2842
aS" However this doesn't change the fact that it would be easy to link the steering wheel to the HoG/front axle"

aS'I was very skeptical of this set because I really thought the redesign degraded the looks of the A-model a lot, but after building it I must say this is an excellent set'
p2845
aS' Good job TLG!'
p2846
aS"I'm still not a huge fan of the model, but this is one awesome review"
p2847
aS' The effort and quality can be clearly seen and I hope you continue making reviews like this'
p2848
aS'Ted, have you described your photography setup somewhere? I love the crisp quality of your pictures'
p2849
aS'Great review'
p2850
aS' I think it look like a great set, both A and B'
p2851
aS' However the panels are the only thing I would need, but still a great looking set'
p2852
aS'Great review Jim'
p2853
aS' I have been sitting on the fence about if I will get this set for a while but I saw one built for the first time at a local brick show on the weekend'
p2854
aS' It definitely looks better in real life than any pics'
p2855
aS' I have decided to buy one'
p2856
aS'A very professional review and really no stone unturned'
p2857
aS" But I'm still not going to rush out and buy a copy"
p2858

aS'A great review Jim'
p2862
aS' Just finished building this set'
p2863
aS' A couple of steps required abit of lego stressing to get together when there was an easier way'
p2864
aS' Just made it into RC ( almost finished it in LDD) which was easy to do as it has so much room for nearly any configuration of motors and not have them showing'
p2865
aS' A great set'

p2868
aS'Wonderful review, but I am still not sold on the set'
p2869
aS" If we get more sets with the bright green I might be tempted to get it, but until then it is too few parts in bright green (too few different types, not the number of pieces) to be able to use that colour effectively in making MOC's"
p2870
aS"True, but I must say I like the new colour, very 'fresh' looking compared to the rather dullish regular green"
p2871
aS" Can't wait to build MOCs with it"
p2872
aS'I have been waiting for this set since the pictures for the toy fairs eirlier in the year and I am glad to say I am not disapointed'
p2873
aS' First the price it is not cheap at ?99'
p2874
aS'99 but I guess that is typical for a set with this amount of electronics in it'
p2875
aS'There is no parts count and I have not had time to add up the 2 pages of contents to get a figure'
p2876
aS' First the box standard flip top with large internal picture and rip to open lid'
p2877
aS' inside There are no numbered bags in this set which I prefer I like to open all the bags and put all the parts in the box before building'
p2878
aS' Next is a picture on the electronics 2 XLmotors as lego describe them and 2 standard motors'
p2879
aS' 2 IR receivers and 1 IR transmitter I know these have been discussed before but I really like the thought that has gone into the transmitters/receivers each receiver has 2 outputs to corespond with the 2 controls on transmitter they also have a choice of 4 channels so one transmitter can control up to 8 independant motors by changing the channel switch'
p2880
aS' The transmitter also has a neat motor direction switch so you can configure the transmitter operation'
p2881
aS' The set comes with three manuals 1 is the main drive mechanism 2 is the cab and engine and 3 is the attachments front and back'
p2882
aS' There is also the now standard parts list in the back of the third manual'
p2883
aS' There is no alternative model instructions despite the pictures of one on the box however there is a reference to the technic website on the back of the box but at the moment the page only has an advert saying the set is to be released on 1st September so I guess I will have to wait untill then to see if the instructions will be online'
p2884
aS' The build is fairly straight forward the main chassis is studless, the next picture shows the motors mounted into the chassis and the drive for the shovel and claw'
p2885
aS' It also shows the V6 technic engine'
p2886
aS' This next picture shows the IR receivers mounted on the back'
p2887
aS' The battery box slots into the back and can be easily slid out with the removal of two pins which is useful because I can imagine I will need to change the batteries on a regular basis'
p2888
aS' The next 2 picture are of the completed model Overall I was very happy with the finished dozer the functions work really well and as I have the monster dino I have used a second transmitter so I dont have to touch the channel switch, I have included some video On my Brickshelf page'
p2889
aS' Unfortunately this set does suffer from some quality issues for example moulding marks on the plates, colour diferences, some of the pins not finished properly, some pins were very stiff and quite hard to push into the holes but the worst issue was an axle that would not turn freely in a hole which just adds extra friction into the system'
p2890
aS' I am glad to see some studded technic in this set I much prefer sets that use both varieties of technic beam'
p2891
aS' There are only 2 Fairings which is a great improvment over recent sets if TLC had tried to make the bulldozer shovel with fairings this would have been a complete disaster'
p2892
aS' Marks for the set 8/10 for price with the number of motors I expected it to be greater'
p2893
aS' 9/10 for fun my kids love this type of set that does something when finished'
p2894
aS' 6/10 for quality TLC really need to work on this one'
p2895
aS' 8/10 overall I would definately get a second one if I see it in the sales'

p2954

aS' I too am curious if this set has been released here in the US'
p2956
aS' I was told that it was a Sept 1 release'
p2957
aS' I agree about the battery life'
p2958
aS' My Dino set lasted about 4 hours too'
p2959
aS"Thanks for the review! This looks like a great set, and with four motors, two receivers and a remote control I wouldn't say it is overpriced"
p2960
aS' It is still a lot of money though'
p2961
aS' If my scholarship permits it I will seriously consider buying this set'
p2962

aS" What is this code you're after? There is a additional code in the booklet (different for every one) you should find it from the front or back cover"
p3012
aS' Also later editions have different codes'
p3013
aS' Some examples: Set 7905 - 4497674 (Front Cover, Bottom Left) Set 8421 - 4284910 (Book 1) and 4284922 (Book 2) (Back Cover, Bottom Right) I\'ll bet the code is then used to "abuse" the Lego cache :-) Mig'
p3014
aS'The new small Technic sets have incredible functionality for their size, and this one is no exception'
p3015
aS' With only 106 parts this crane can roll, extend, rotate, lift (and hold in any position) and has working stabilisers! The boom extends the same as the other sets with this boom; simply pull it'
p3016
aS' It works surprisingly well and due to circular ridges inside the boom the extension (which is just a standard beam) will hold in place'
p3017
aS' The gear at the back controls the height of the boom'
p3018
aS' As you can see the boom is only half extended'
p3019
aS' Boom fully extended, half down'
p3020
aS' The cable is kept in place via two gears and a blue pin, same as the 7905 crane'
p3021
aS' Even under decent weights this works well'
p3022
aS' The stabilisers however cannot handle much weight once the load is moved off axis'
p3023
aS' The stablilsers are a very simple but effective design'
p3024
aS' Another shot of the stablilsers'
p3025
aS' This also shows how far the boom will decend'
p3026
aS' The boom height mechanism works well also'
p3027
aS' I love the cab design'
p3028
aS' Overall this is a remarkable achievement for the low price'
p3029
aS' I bought it for the boom piece as I want to improve the crane that came with 7998 7898 ( :-$ )'
p3030
aS' I highly recommend it'

aS"Very nice review Sinner! *y* *wub* So we are getting more and more reviews with figs in it, that?s great! :'-) I actually wanted to skip this technic set, but your review made me think again"

p3051
aS' But one question'

aS" What Crane are you refering to that came with 7998? That is the new heavy loader, and it didn't come with an any crane> 8-?"

p3057
aS'Alright, so I usually do quick photo reviews when I get new sets'
p3058
aS" That's what I'll do here, but there's quite a few photos, so I thought I might as well make its own review thread"
p3059
aS' So, I got the Kwik-E-Mart by paying just2much on an early eBay copy'
p3060
aS" I think it's worth it, as this week I'm gonna be super busy, so I was able to build it Saturday and stuff"
p3061
aS" Here's my video review, I think it's one of my best: Well, let's get onto this photo review"
p3062
aS' The set is $200 USD with a little over 2100 pieces'
p3063
aS' The official release is April 15th for VIP members, May 1st for everyone else at LEGO Stores'
p3064
aS' And, if you want full size pictures, check out my Flickr by clicking here'
p3065
aS' The minifigures included are great'
p3066
aS' You get three exclusive minifigures (one being a completely exclusive character- the first time LEGO has ever put an exclusive mould in a Direct to Consumer set), and you get three of the series most popular characters in their normal attire for those who missed out on the first Simpsons minifigures series'
p3067
aS" The Kwik-E-Mart's exterior is loaded with lots of sticker details"
p3068
aS" The only printed detail you'll see in the exterior is the dial pad in the phone booth, which has appeared in some other licensed themes since last year"
p3069
aS' ( ^^^ right here is there the store can be opened- a simple Technic pin and receiver keeps it in place and allows for opening and closing) The roof of the store includes the garden shown in the Paul McCartney episode'
p3070
aS' The roof can be slided out/in once you open it with the hinge part'
p3071
aS" Here's a look at the store with the roof removed"
p3072
aS' The floors are a nice sand blue color, coming with 8x16 thin plates: And, for the interior, from the view of the store opened with the hinges at the back that I mentioned earlier: The left front corner, which includes some arcade machines of Bonestorm and Great White Hunter, an amazingly done Buzz cola soda machine, juice machine, the checkout counter, ect: The right front corner, with food aisles, freezers, and a frozen Jasper sticker: The back left corner, which includes some nice coffee kettle builds, the donut tray, hotdogs, ect: The right back corner, which has a door leading to a very small hallway that only has a mouse and cheese in it'
p3073
aS" The hallway leads to the employees only door in the back, and it's very hard to get in the door way (not that there's anything to do inside there): Also included is Clancy's copcar, which fits three figures: Here's a look at the piece list in the instructions, click on each to be lead to an enlarged version of the pic: Also included are some awesome printed pieces, and two unprinted coffee cups! Honestly, I think this set is perfect"
p3074
aS' The price is fantastic, and has a great PPP ratio'
p3075
aS' They really went above and beyond by including Snake in this set'
p3076
aS" I honestly think it's better than the Simpsons House in terms of accuracy and the value here- so many cool pieces printed and in exclusive colors"
p3077
aS" So, that's my quick picture review"
p3078
aS" Hope you guys enjoyed, and I'd love to hear your thoughts!"
p3079

p3083
aS'Thanks for the review'

aS" I can't help but think the minifigures are the weak part of the set"
p3085
aS' Snake and Apu are great but the rest'
p3086
aS" I don't know"
p3087
aS' They kinda redundant now'
p3088
aS' They could at least give us new torso printing, like Homer wearing his jacket or Bart wearing his blue t-shirt or Marge wearing her coat'
p3089
aS" Or, as I said in the discussion thread, I'd have included Jasper in CMF series 2 and a Frozen version here"
p3090

p3098
aS' Overall, the set looks kinda smaller than what I thought'
p3099
aS' I agree, but so many people were complaining about how The Simpsons House should have included the most common versions (mostly because the eyes or whatever), so I think LEGO played it safe and just included the normal versions'
p3100
aS' It makes sense, since Series 1 is gone forever, and the common versions were in there, and this set is bound to be in stock for a very long time like the Death Star'
p3101
aS' I never really agreed when people were complaining about the alternate eye prints personally, but I guess this is a good business choice based on previous feedback'

aS'Hello everyone'
p3104
aS' Excellent review! English is not my native language, but I want to express my opinion'
p3105
aS" Simpsons house was the first of its kind, and I can say without exaggeration that this is the most impressive set that I'm going (my collection http://brickset"
p3106
aS'com/sets/ownedby-celeb )'
p3107
aS' I look at the video from the Kwik-e-Mart, and is difficult to say how good it is compared with the house'
p3108
aS' The main disadvantages that I said to myself, is this: build the walls of the large panels, next is access to the roof (gray parts in front of the back door (I think they represent the stairs)) is not on the level with doors on the roof and when you open them, you can see the white block is openly trash, my points of view'
p3109
aS' Boxes on the left of go to the store and powersauce box, i want see make real and not just a cube, f'
p3110
aS'e'
p3111
aS' such as in the unreleased Star Wars set'
p3112
aS' About minifigures, I fully agree with Robert8'
p3113
aS' Two more of the same Homer, Marge and Bart?! Personally, I put my set as a scene and all the replays minifigure are inside the house that was not identical characters next And also absolutely terrible Bart`s accessory This set is made parking for bikes and it looks very cool'
p3114
aS" But damn, it is hoped to see the Bart or Lisa's bike, instead of useless balloons with paint"
p3115
aS' The walls are made with convex inside panels, why so? can anyone know? have not seen any pictures with such walls in TV show'
p3116
aS' Why did not they turn? I personally really like how realized roof, but my brother says that it is terrible :) garden could do more in the series there were almost jungle I do not know how to be considered here, maybe anyone can express any opinion or idea? I look at the Simpsons house, and then look at the photo of this e-Mart'
p3117
aS' I can not understand, in the house we have a garage, two floors, cool floor, a lot of furniture, all the rooms and walls, collected from cubes, many additional accessories'
p3118
aS' And where is all this detail here? It looks much smaller (maybe even poorer)'
p3119
aS' If they still will release next year comic book store, it will be even less? Of course it is difficult to estimate without seeing it live, we have it will be sold only in May'
p3120
aS' At first sight it does not look so impressive as the house'
p3121
aS' Can certainly the case in the limit on the amount of detail, but why it was impossible to add $ 50 to the cost and make Jasper, the more detailed the roof, the walls of the smaller elements, that it was not convex'
p3122
aS' Sad'

aS' I expect a D2C set to be better that this'
p3139
aS' 60+ stickers? The same thing'
p3140
aS' Same price for less bricks and smaller build then the house'
p3141
aS' Strange coloured bricks on the outside wall (some ugly mix of yellow + tan) Panels again with their fronts facing towards the inside of the shop so we and up with those squares all around'
p3142
aS' The walls are yellow, this was so nice, lost opportunity to make it in some other less common colour'
p3143
aS' Then again the set overall looks is good'
p3144
aS' The roof is a nice detail'
p3145
aS' The shop looks actually like a real one, not just an approximation of one'
p3146
aS" The roof tiles are in Dark Orange - we got new/rare colour here The car looks interesting to build (just like the pink one from the house) Lots of nice references to the show It's The Simpsons! Definitely a must buy"
p3147
aS' but for a discounted price'
p3148
aS" I'll try to find one with maybe damaged box or after-display copy"

aS' Strange coloured bricks on the outside wall (some ugly mix of yellow + tan) Agreed! Glad my GF likes to do stickers! 60 yikes! But looking at it now I think the tan/yellow is supposed to represent where the paint is fading on the back of the store? I guess?'
p3159
aS"Here's a size comp to the house: Click for a bigger image"
p3160
aS"That's actually not bad sizing, IMO"
p3161
aS' Sure, it looks like you get a lot more with the house, but the Kwik-E-Mart has a lot more of those little references that make it Simpsons'
p3162
aS' I agree with some of the complaining; a real Jasper behind a trans-blue panel would have been cool'
p3163
aS' You could always bulk up the roof with more foliage'
p3164
aS' I think it has a great foundation as a set, but could do with a few mods to make it better'
p3165
aS' Thanks for the pictures; I greatly appreciate being able to see reviews like this before dropping $200 on a LEGO set'
p3166
aS'Great Review Just2Good, honestly I love this set lots of great details and references'
p3167
aS'One thing that may justify the price: it has 527 different parts (if I counted correctly)'
p3168
aS' I alway heard the more different parts the more difficult the set is to produce'
p3169
aS' The Simpsons House already had an astonishig amount of different pieces, but this one is even more extreme'

aS'Great review'
p3180
aS"Nice review, I'm building it (need to finish it, but I'm at work right now) With the printed piece, you forgot to show the chocolat milk 1x1 brick, which is exclusive to this set yet (it isn't referenced on bricklink yet, only the blue one) The set is really fun to build, with a lot of little pieces for the fridges"
p3181
aS" I haven't put the stickers yet, will see the final product to put the essentials ones"
p3182
aS'Did anyone else have a problem with the piano against the wall of The Simpsons House? It just kept coming off way too easily and I was getting really frustrated with it sticking out and not fully going on so I had to put the two tiles that hold them one place over away from the wall for it to sit properly without falling out, I think I might put Snowball II behind it since cats love to hide underneath or behind things lol but just curious to know if anyone else was encountering this problem with the previous set'
p3183
aS'I recently acquired 90% of this set, so I thought I would do a review of it'
p3184
aS' Please note that half of the Mini-figs are wrong, and there are some part substitutions'
p3185
aS' This is the only set that comes with this plate'

p3189
aS' (Good set design Lego!) The stairs are old Fabuland ones, and have been used in a few other sets'
p3190
aS' This is the only one that has them in "ParaPink" however'
p3191
aS' What is the difference between "ParaPink" and "Pink"? Dunno'
p3192
aS' The big windows are in only two other sets, both of them DACTA ones! The smaller ones were in one other Paradisa set'
p3193
aS' The interior, while simple, works very well'
p3194
aS' I love the coffee machine'
p3195
aS' A cute car came with the set as well'
p3196
aS' The bird house is a nice idea as well'

It has great playability with really cool "80\'s Miami" feel *wub* That pink was actually pretty cool and went well with that lime green (I think its lime but I\'m not 100% positive)'

aS' Once again this pisses me off so much that I was in my dark ages when this theme was out !! I loved it, especially all the beach/water themes *wub* I really wish TLC decided to bring that water Paradisia back !! Who knows !! After all they need to make some girlie sets !!

aS' 11 round bricks altogether'

aS' I don?t know if TLC ever produced this set with bley'
p3279
aS' From the following pic you can clearly see, that the set is an old one'
p3280
aS' Look at these slope bricks'
p3281
aS' See what I mean? All bricks are looking exactly the same! Buy a set today means get at least three different textures on the slopes and maybe even more shades of tan'
p3282
aS' :-X >:-( I have said that in many other threads here and I?m saying it again: Back to the roots, Lego! You were able to produce good quality'

aS' That sure looked very strange'
p3296

p3297
aS' The Score: Brick selection: 10/10 excellent color and brick selection (these were the days'
p3298
aS') Playability: 9/10 great unloading mechanism Price/piece count ratio: 8/10 at peeron it says 20$, I got it for 39,95$ -> 30?/228 bricks'

p3349
aS' She is waiting for us to give us a guided tour of her establishment ;-) Another bit of SB history: this set comes from the following episode: Boating School: SpongeBob fails his boating test for the 38th time (what a freaking retard lool)'

p3354
aS' As you can see the set is divided in 3 polybags'
p3355
aS' Shamelessly (but nonetheless wilfully hehe), I will disregard the third one which is that playability crap course !! I would have reviewed it but since it involves stickers, I didn?t want to ruin the parts and without stickers it would look dull, plain and ugly (it does look crappy with so imagine without), so that review will not be 100% complete and I do apologise in advance'
p3356
aS' But how many of you would have build that and keep it hehe Off :-P 1/ Mfs and extras I will start with the really cool Miss Puff *wub* (the fig mind you !!)'

p3363
aS" Yes the roud tile bouey is printed !! Its the same as in SB's bed in the Bikini Bottom set ;-) OK, its time for those two great buildings: the lighthouse and the school + pontoon !! Before reviewing them individually, here is a general pic"

aS' 2/ The lighthouse One of the main reason to own that great set !! Sure it suffers from accute stickeretite (sad but :-D )'
p3365
aS' T worst is that door), but nonetheless a great and simple building !! Great white/red colour scheme, and a really fantastic 2 turning lights !! I really like the yellow top of the lighthouse, it adds to the comic atmosphere of that theme instead of having a more plain red/white only'
p3366
aS' The rear has nothing really fancy, except tools to fix it in case of problems hehe'
p3367
aS' The only thing I modified since I didn?t build the third polybag is that I got rid of the trechnic parts on the right of the lighthoue to replace them with regular ?logs? All hail the tower King !! :-D 3/ The school and pontoon I really like that little building and its great to see that once again TLC uses the amazing dark blue color !! Its really a simple design but looks fantastic and can be used for many things in a town hehe I also really like the combination with those dark bluish grey slopes !! The rear reveals the desk, stickers on the wall (d?oh !!) and two clams serving as chairs (really like on the show)'
p3368
aS' Its really great to see that TLC stays really as close to the show as possible'
p3369
aS' The pontoon again is simple yet really cool and effective'
p3370
aS' And its really nice to have 2 lifesaving boueys'
p3371
aS' The only thing I modified since I didn?t build the third polybag is that I got rid of the trechnic parts in front of the pontoon to replace them with regular ?logs? On the overall, I think its really a great set !! Apart from the crap stickers, I think TLC should have ditched (or simplified) the third playability polybag to lower the cost !! Oh well, parts are always usefull (except those one part shitty palm trees !!)'
p3372
aS' So until my next review, I bid you farewell my Spongebob fans !! And I really hope to see next year hehe Will SB get his driver?s license one day ? For the sake of Bikini Bottom, lets hope not !! No license ever On !! *yoda*'
p3373
aS'That?s really a great and overall nice playset with a very cool Mrs'
p3374
aS' Puff and a fine new Spongebob! *sweet* The boating school?s indeed very nice with a beautiful color scheme, and so is the lighthouse'
p3375
aS' I?m really tempted to buy a second set just to "complete" these buildings'
p3376
aS' although it?s a little too expensive for doing so, and it wouldn?t even fit with the style of the other SB sets'
p3377
aS' X-D Wet highway to the poor puffer fish? privat hell on! :-D'
p3378
aS"You've done it again"
p3379
aS' *yoda* ! Great reveiw'
p3380
aS" I really like this set, but in my opinon, $50 is steep considering I won't actually 'play' with it"
p3381
aS' I mean, half of it is a track for peat sake! Ill eventually get it for the Mrs'
p3382
aS' Puff figure, though'
p3383
aS' *y*'
p3384
aS'*yoda* comes through again! I love this set'
p3385
aS' but it just costs too much for Australians so I will be giving it a miss'
p3386
aS" :'-( It is a shame as it has clams in it"
p3387
aS' 8-|'
p3388
aS"I like this one better than the other one for parts and such, plus I'm generally a sucker for any different minifig, but yeah, that price is steep"
p3389
aS' Great review though!'
p3390
aS'One more SB face - YEAH *wub*! Being a lighthouse freak I really like it, the trans clear blue ones rocks *y*! I?m getting it - period! SB On copmike'
p3391
aS'Another great review, thanks *yoda*! Man, those smooth slopes really look like crap when on a roof :-| That was the whole reason they had texture in the first place'
p3392
aS" |-/ I'll never liked those, they feel so cheap! The new SB head is great, and can Mrs"
p3393
aS" Puff's legs move? I just ask since her feet are separate, and in figs where the legs can't move, they're usually one piece at the bottom to keep them from breaking off"
p3394
aS' The set looks great, and seems to have a lot of playability'
p3395
aS"Nice review !! I'm not a big fan of those Spongebob figs"
p3396
aS' However this set has some very useful pieces'
p3397
aS' This is actually the first time I took a decent look at a Spongebob set'
p3398
aS"Yoda, I don't thank you for this review, and after the Chump Bucket review too! Because I'm so exited to have them that since I ordered them from s@h, I come back home aftre the work the faster I can, with the hope to see a big box on my bed"
p3399
aS' and this, even if I know that it tooks more than 6-7 days to have my order'
p3400
aS' This Mrs'
p3401
aS' Puff figs is really really nice *wub* And this 3rd SB head too!'
p3402
aS'Man, that Sponge-bob head cracks me up! Hilarity'
p3403
aS'This is a cool set, although I much prefer the Chum Bucket set'
p3404
aS" I don't see what's wrong with the course, then again I can see why AFOLs wouldn't like it"
p3405
aS" It's just playability really"
p3406
aS' I like the breakable wall though'
p3407
aS' The building is cool, a few modifications (i'
p3408
ag3111
aS' making it more realistic, real chairs for a start) and it would make a cool little wharf for your Lego town'
p3409
aS" And to SW4J, Mrs Puff's legs are connected at the feet, if you look closely"
p3410
aS' So, thanks for the great review, *yoda*!'
p3411
aS'Thank you *yoda* for strike 2! It?s SB again'
p3412
aS' |-/ Sticker Alarm! :-X But this set is better than Chum Bucket'
p3413
aS' There are far more interesting parts if you don?t like SB'
p3414
aS' Especially the light house and the little hut with the wooden pontoon'
p3415
aS' *y* And yet again another set with smooth slopes and rough ones'
p3416
aS' Too bad, too bad'
p3417
aS' >:-( >:-( >:-( If I just knew the person who is responsible for that'
p3418
aS"Nice review mate, the set look's great and a real must for all those SB fan's out there"
p3419
aS" The whole set scream playability that's for sure, which is great because let's be honest their's gonna be alot of kid's and *yoda* out their playing with it :-P X-D ;-) "
p3420
aS" Geezzzzz what is it with all those bloody stikers? This set would be soooooo much better with printed piece's instead of those, still once your over that at least the rest is ok"
p3421
aS" Am i the only one who thinks Mrs Puff kinda look's like a kinder egg toy? Their's nothing wrong with that mind you (yes i have a kinder problem X-D ) just seem's strange to me"
p3422
aS'Maybe mrs Puff has a nice toy inside X-D I like this review'
p3423
aS' The lighthouse part and the school are nice enough for other towns'
p3424
aS" and the figs are nice, even mrs puffs 2 pieces you can't use for other things"
p3425
aS" :-) Pity that it's 50 dollars/+/- 60 euro"
p3426
aS' for half price I would think about it'

p3440
aS'It looks like a good set but I would rather get the neighborhood one'
p3441
aS'The set, and the other Designer sets that came out with it (especially 4888) are incredibly well designed sets'
p3442
aS' I wish Lego would go back to doing sets like these as I loved the multitude of instructions and ideas'
p3443
aS' The last batch of Creator sets had zero ideas, even though I know several were made'
p3444
aS" :'-( Anyway, less whining, more review"
p3445
aS' The lion is the main model'
p3446
aS" His mouth doesn't fully close, but it does open more"
p3447
aS' The head works well from most angles'
p3448
aS' I love the dark orange bricks; great for rust'
p3449
aS' He is quite solid, but the joints take the weight well'
p3450
aS" The neck goes side to side and rotates, but doesn't go up and down"
p3451
aS' The body is built in two parts and pinned in the middle'
p3452
aS' With what is left you can make what I think is a hyena, a silly plant MOC'
p3453
aS'and what I believe is a vulture'
p3454
aS' There are also instructions for a few other models including a bat, boar and a snake'
p3455
aS' which I quite like'
p3456
aS' He can be built at the same time as'
p3457
aS'this cute little lizard'
p3458
aS' Overall this is a great set with an excellent blend of colours and pieces'
p3459
aS' I wanted it for steampunk potentials'
p3460
aS' *sweet* I hope you liked the review'
p3461
aS' Till next time'
p3462

p3465
aS'Great review as always! *y* LEGO is timeless, so there is no such thing as an old set'
p3466
aS" I never build brick monsters/creatures, but this set had such a nice assortment of parts that I had to pick a couple up as they weren't clearancing out on Shop @ Home"
p3467
aS' I absolutely love dark orange and tan, so it was an automatic win'
p3468
aS' I love the use of "familiar characters" in the review, I can almost hear Hinckley screaming, "my megabloks!" :-P You sort of look like you\'re planning some vulture stew though'
p3469
aS' Might have to start a new challenge to determine a winner there'
p3470
aS" Sinner and his Big Pot o' Doom VS Giant Vulture! Only thing is, does everything horrify the Mrs? She seems perpetually shocked and/or dismayed at the goings on here"
p3471
aS' Now that I think about it, I can see why'
p3472
aS" I'm occasionally shocked and/or dismayed 8-? Brick Built Beasties On! *y*"
p3473
aS'A very fine review of a very fine set, thanks Sinner'
p3474
aS' *y* The variety of cool colors in that set?s just formidable'
p3475
aS" One more beautiful Creator set indeed! Roaarrrr on! :'-)"
p3476
aS'Thank you for the nice review, Sinner! I also bought this set but in combination with 4883 when it was on sale (50% - hurray!) at S@H'
p3477
aS' I made a short review of 4883 but wasn?t really sure what to tell about 4884'
p3478
aS' So I?m glad you did that for me'
p3479
aS' :-D I have different feelings about this set'
p3480
aS' On the one hand I love the lion'
p3481
aS' He is really impressive (even my wife -not known for being Lego enthusiastic- asked me, if there were more animals of this kind)'
p3482
aS' The lion is - restricted - poseable and the colors used are fantastic'
p3483
aS' *wub* 3 models can be built simultaneously - that?s great! On the other hand I still don?t know what to do with these rotation joints'
p3484
aS' *wacko* And the other models are somehow disappointing compared to the lion'
p3485
aS' I seem to have missed the little lizard'
p3486
aS' :-$ I put it on my "to do-list"'
p3487
aS' Like all the Creator sets: Great parts pack - but wait until they get on sale! X-D For me - I had a lot more fun with 4883'
p3488

p3539
aS'99 Minifigs: 2 Theme: Jurassic World Year of Release: 2015 Links: Box The front of the box has the Jurassic World logo along with the set number, piece count, etc'
p3540
aS' Its a decent box size for a $20 set'
p3541
aS' Here it is compared to a minifigure'
p3542
aS" Here's the back of the box"
p3543
aS' It shows all of the features from the set an ad for the video game'
p3544
aS' The back also shows a small picture with a silhouette of the dinosaurs from the line, along with their set numbers'
p3545
aS' Instruction Booklet The booklet shows the same thing as the front of the box, nothing more, nothing less'
p3546
aS' Near the back of the booklet, there is a picture with all of the characters from the sets'
p3547
aS' The other page shows all the dinosaurs with a mini box that shows the size comparisons'
p3548
aS' The Minifigures The minifigures in this set are Simon Masrani and an ACU'
p3549
aS' Both of them have excellent printing on the front and the back'
p3550
aS' The gun is the same one from TLM that the SSP used'
p3551
aS' Simon Masrani is the only one with a double sided face'
p3552
aS' His second face shows a scared/worried exp<b></b>ression'
p3553
aS' He has a zipped up jacket or jumpsuit with a shirt underneath'
p3554
aS' The ACU trooper only has one face which is a scared/worried exp<b></b>ression'
p3555
aS' I would have a scared exp<b></b>ression too if I was about to get eaten by a dinosaur'
p3556
aS' He has great detail on his torso and legs'
p3557
aS" Let's take a look at the vest"
p3558
aS' The vest is the same mold from the SSP in TLM I think'
p3559
aS' It has the letters ACU on the front too'
p3560
aS' The back is nothing interesting'
p3561
aS' Pteranodon The pteranodon has great printing too'
p3562
aS' The colors match the ones that the pteranodons from the movie have'
p3563
aS' The wings, mouth, and head are a rubbery type of plastic and are easily bendable'
p3564
aS' It uses the same mold from the pteranodon in the 2012 Dino line'
p3565
aS" Here's a comparison between the two"
p3566
aS" Spare Parts The spare parts aren't many, just a few extras"
p3567
aS" The Helicopter At first the helicopter was 'meh' when I first saw it on the box"
p3568
aS" Now that I've built it, I've got to say that I really like it"
p3569
aS" Its my favorite helicopter of all of the ones I've built"
p3570
aS' Its sturdy and sleek'
p3571
aS" It's not too bulky either"
p3572
aS' The first play feature in this set is the net launcher'
p3573
aS" It works pretty well, not one of my favorite features but it does what it's meant to do"
p3574
aS' The other play feature is on the other side'
p3575
aS' Its a stud shooter which can be used by a minifigure'
p3576
aS' You can put it on their hand or you can leave it there and let someone operate it'
p3577
aS' The shooter can fold up inside the helicopter as well'
p3578
aS' There are stickers on both sides of the helicopter and they also have the Jurassic World logo with Dino marks'
p3579
aS" Final Verdict Value: 9/10 - For $20 this set isn't that bad"
p3580
aS' The parts count is a little low for a $20 set but the price is probably because of licensing'
p3581
aS" Other than that, it's a great deal, I would've hoped for maybe some bait for the pteranodon but that can easily be fixed"
p3582
aS" Design: 9/10 - I REALLY love the way this helicopter looks, it's sleekness and design is great"
p3583
aS" The only flaw this has is the huge net launcher, it's too big in my opinion"
p3584
aS' Minifigs: 10/10[/b] - The minifigures are extremely detailed and it even includes an exclusive minifigure'
p3585
aS' Playability: 9/10 - There are many things you can do with this set'
p3586
aS' The swoosh factor is great and so are the play features'
p3587
aS" Parts: 10/10[/b] - They're useful parts and there isn't many huge specialized pieces in here either"
p3588
aS" Overall: 9/10 - This set is great for fans of Jurassic World, it's also a nice parts pack"
p3589
aS" There's one exclusive minifigure in here too which makes it even better"
p3590
aS' Having a little fun with the set Hope you liked my first review here on Eurobricks! Please leave any suggestions on what to improve, thanks! Edited by TheLazyChicken, 02 May 2015 - 10:19 PM'

aS' And honestly I hope it does well enough to spark more Dino/Jurassic Park-World interest because I want to see MORE Dino "minifigures"'
p3599
aS' Maybe a Brontosaurus or something'
p3600
aS' I will most likely be buying many of the Dinosaur minifigures here'
p3601
aS" However I doubt I'll buy the actual sets or the genetically altered dinosaur (which can only work for Jurassic World)"

aS' Only suggestion is that some of your pictures are a little bit dark'
p3608
aS' (Especially the box front one) But really good for your first review! Thanks a lot! Thanks! BrickG, on 03 May 2015 - 07:49 AM, said: This set is IMO average'

aS'Nice review! Although, that picture of the ad reminded me of how some of the things surrounding Jurassic World (Lego, that is) seems hastily put together'
p3612
aS' Just look at that the minifig'
p3613
aS" He is Star Lord's head and hair, Indiana Jones' torso with different arms, and City legs"
p3614
aS' To me, that seems a bit weak, especially for a video game'

p3620
aS"Yesterday I went to Toys 'r Us and bought the Dilophosaur Ambush"
p3621
aS' Beside that the shop had a display of the JW polybags'
p3622
aS' For 3,49 I picked up two of them'
p3623
aS' Now here is my little review of this pretty nice set'
p3624
aS' First some data: Line: Jurassic World Year: 2015 Pieces: 29 Price: 3,49 Packaging: Polybag Ok, lets start with the polybag itself'
p3625
aS' It is a standard size and had plenty of room for all the parts'
p3626
aS' The front depicts the whole set with a little hexagon on the right with a seperate picture of the dinosaur and its name'
p3627
aS' In this case the Celophysis is called Gallimimus'
p3628
aS' Weird choice Next is the instruction sheet'
p3629
aS' It is a doublesided paper with every building step in clear sight'
p3630
aS' The part selection is nice'
p3631
aS' There are only a few but all of them are pretty usefull for all kind of builds'
p3632
aS' There are two parts which stood-out'
p3633
aS' Both are printed tiles'
p3634
aS' The first one is the yellow/black warning tile in 1x4'
p3635
aS" You can't have enough of that"
p3636
aS' The second one is a 2x2 tile with the Jurassic World logo on it'
p3637
aS" That's pure awesome"
p3638
aS' The bigger sets seem to have only sticker for that, so this little set is a perfect way to get hold of this nice tile'
p3639
aS' The leftovers'
p3640
aS' Nothing special'
p3641
aS' Here is the complete trap'
p3642
aS' It is a basic build and functions pretty well'
p3643
aS' In the end the parts are more interesting as the build so it will definitely end up as a parts-pack'
p3644
aS' Now on to the star of this bag'
p3645
aS' The Celophysis/Gallimimus'
p3646
aS" I don't know why Lego decided to call this dinosaur mold any different, but I think it has to do with movie-connection and the will to not produce a new mold"
p3647
aS' Nevermind, this figure is great and the colour is very bright and totally stood out'
p3648
aS' Pretty beastie'
p3649
aS' A comparison between the 2015 Gallimimus and the 2012 Celophysis'
p3650
aS' The final set in all its glory'
p3651
aS' Final verdict: It is a great little set'
p3652
aS' The parts used a nice and usefull'
p3653
aS' The printed tiles are the secret stars of this set and the dinosaur is fun two'
p3654
aS' With a few packs of these you could easily build a Celophysis pack with lots of Jurassic World signs on their way'
p3655
aS' Highly recommended'
p3656
aS'nice little review! now i definitely have to check if the toys r us in dortmund has it, too! Edited by KCMatze, 03 May 2015 - 01:34 PM'
p3657
aS"I'm pleased to see that this is available for purchase, at least in some parts of the world, rather than only being available with the JW game"
p3658
aS" Nice review, I'll going to scope out whether Toys R Us in Sweden is carrying them, although I've never seen polybags in there before"
p3659
aS'Nice review! I really hope its avaliable for sale in the US'
p3660
aS'Thank you, guys'
p3661
aS" I'm glad you liked this review"
p3662
aS" It's a nice little set"
p3663
aS'Great review man, really well written and structured'
p3664
aS' Hoping to go on a hunt and see if this is available in UK stores soon'
p3665
aS'Nice I had to buy the JW Lego game to get mine'
p3666
aS"Great review! But Spoiler I didn't see or even hear mentioned a Galliminus or any sort of dino trap in the movie"
p3667
aS' I wonder where this design came from!'
p3668
aS"Lego 31036 Creator Toy and Grocery Shop Thanks to EuroBricks for making this review possible! For years, Lego has offered a house of some sort in the Creator line each year - with the standard Creator 3-in-1 instructions, that's given us a very wide variety of housing"
p3669
aS' In 2014, they added a business option with their 31026 Bike Shop and Cafe set'
p3670
aS" This continues into this year's Toy and Grocery Shop set"
p3671
aS" These shops are smaller than the very detailed modular buildings, but that should help them fit in better with the other City sets, and this also lets them get into more kids' cities with their lower pricetag"
p3672
aS' Name: Toy and Grocery Shop Set Number: 31036 Pieces: 466 Price: $39'
p3673
aS'99 Minifigs: 2 Theme: Creator Year of Release: 2015 Links: Bricklink Peeron Brickset The Box The front of the box shows the "A" version model out of the three, plus insets of the B and C versions'
p3674
aS' I like the sorta-European looking backdrop; it goes well with the styling of the buildings'
p3675
aS' Interestingly, the main model is shown opened up for play, while the two insets show those versions folded'
p3676
aS' The Box Top On the top of the box, Lego helpfully shows that with 3 of these sets, you can make a whole street'
p3677
aS' The Box Back On the back, you get to again see all three versions together, but this time, folded'
p3678
aS" It's a little creepy though with those clones running around :) The Manuals Yep, three actual, printed manuals"
p3679
aS' There\'s nothing indicating them as being A, B, and C models, but it\'s pretty obvious looking at the designs which is the "main" model and which are the alternates'
p3680
aS' The Contents Bags of parts and two plates'
p3681
aS' Nothing terribly exciting to see here'
p3682
aS' The Minifigs Nothing new here, but two nice figs none-the-less'
p3683
aS" Well, Bricklink does say that both figs are unique to this set, but there's not any new parts to them"
p3684
aS" The closest thing to rare is the female head - it's only in this set, 2013's Dragon Mountain Castle set, a UK store grand opening set, and one of the 2014 Holiday freebie sets"
p3685
aS" The faces aren't that unique, but I guess this exact combo of two faces on the head is"
p3686
aS' I love the kid torso with the spaceman on it'
p3687
aS' The Minifig Backs No back printing on anything here except for an alternate female face'
p3688
aS' Sorry'
p3689
aS' I do like that her two faces are so different though'
p3690
aS' That\'s much better than when a head has a "scared" and a "more scared" face'
p3691
aS' The "C" Build Enough with the basics; let\'s build'
p3692
aS" I'm going to review them in the same order I built them, backwards"
p3693
aS" Since you can tell immediately looking at the 3 designs that they're going to use different numbers of pieces and so forth, I figured I'd build the smallest first lest it seem like a letdown"
p3694
aS' All three have some basic similarities - the two plates are hinged to give a building that opens for play'
p3695
aS' They also do have interiors, which you can see starting to form here'
p3696
aS' The "C" Build, Front It\'s a pretty quick build, so it\'s done already'
p3697
aS" Here's the front of the building with it opened up"
p3698
aS' Like this, it appears to be two separate stores, a newsstand and some sort of shop you can enter'
p3699
aS" All the printed tiles help give the newsstand a detailed appearance, but I'm not sure why they've got a $100 bill lying on the ledge"
p3700
aS' The "C" Build, Rear From the back side, the interiors are pretty plain'
p3701
aS' The shop half has a plant in a jar and a weird chair, and the newsstand just has a register'
p3702
aS' The "C" Build, Sides Here\'s the two sides of the folded building'
p3703
aS" On the hinge side, there's a bunch of windows in a disjointed wall with random colors"
p3704
aS' On the other, why did they put in a huge window when the set does include a trans-clear door that could have gone there? And you get a small patch of plants, like so many sets seem to have these days'
p3705
aS' The "C" Build, Extras That\'s a lot of leftovers there'
p3706
aS' And not just little stuff - multiple doors, stairs, etc'
p3707
aS' And unused sand green is always a little sad'
p3708
aS' The "B" Build, 1 A pretty similar start, with the hinge and little garden and some tiles along the ground'
p3709
aS' The "B" Build, 2 Now we see a big windowed wall, some details like lights, and how it has the usual alternate model "weird part usage" - like a 1x4 brick with side studs being used over the doorway, even though those side studs will not get used'
p3710
aS' The "B" Build, Front The finished building gives us a nice little post office, with a letter-carrying bird on the roof'
p3711
aS" Hope that's not their normal method of delivery! Something about the colors just doesn't work for me though"
p3712
aS' The combo of white / light grey / dark grey / black / sand green plus tan is just too much'
p3713
aS" The tan window and door frames I don't like"
p3714
aS' The "B" Build, Inside On the inside, things are weird'
p3715
aS" The counter on the left is ok, but the light above the door (with a yellow clip? ugly!) is too big, and everything else over there by the door doesn't make much sense either"
p3716
aS' The "B" Build, Sides I like the front side here, except the colors are still too much'
p3717
aS' The bench, greenery, mailbox on the corner, and streetlight are all nice'
p3718
aS" The boy is a little creepy though - binoculars in hand PLUS a telescope on the roof of the post office? Why? The hinge side shows more of the weird colors you get in the wall, but that's going to be hidden when the set is open"
p3719
aS" Plus we even see that on big modulars at times, so it's not SO terrible"
p3720
aS' The "B" Build, Leftovers Again, a lot of leftover parts'
p3721
aS" It's obvious this was another alternate, but it'd be nice to see more of them used to make a bigger building"
p3722
aS" But let's move on to the model that DOES use them all"
p3723
aS' The "A" Build, 1 The first half starts like this'
p3724
aS" Maybe it's just my bias, but it already feels like a more detailed build"
p3725
aS' Bottles on the wall, the yellow and red awning over the window, etc'
p3726
aS' The "A" Build, 2 The other half starts off with detailed work too'
p3727
aS" I think that's a red vending machine"
p3728
aS' The stairs are also VERY solidly built'
p3729
aS" I also appreciate the effort to get that diagonal base where a door will be - it's such a nice touch to have sections of a building that aren't right angles"
p3730
aS' The "A" Build, 3 Not too much has been added, but I wanted to showcase the tiny toys before they get hidden by a wall'
p3731
aS' That robot and train are just fantastic little micro builds'
p3732
aS' The "A" Build, 4 Things are coming together quickly'
p3733
aS' The walls, windows, and doors get the first floor nearly done'
p3734
aS" I'm still not big on the sand green and tan combo, but I do really like the red and yellow awnings"
p3735
aS' The "A" Build, 5 It appears the shop owner lives upstairs, since we\'ve got a bedroom forming here'
p3736
aS' The bed is a little plain, but the table and lamp on the other half are great'
p3737
aS' And my big fingers did not like putting all those railings on the balcony, with the telescope posts and tile tops'
p3738
aS' Knocked quite a few off before I got them all done'
p3739
aS' The "A" Build, Front And it\'s done'
p3740
aS' All the details make this set really feel like a mini-modular'
p3741
aS' The roofline has great greebling, and the shop contents, and on and on'
p3742
aS" It's not perfect though"
p3743
aS" The tiny car above the toy store door isn't nearly as good as the toys inside"
p3744
aS" And the kid's yellow scooter? The wheels aren't even on the ground, much less able to roll"
p3745
aS' The scooter looks decent though, so that counts for something'
p3746
aS" Well, at least as long as you are at this angle, since the boy's only got 1 foot on the 1 stud wide scooter"
p3747
aS' The "A" Build, Inside Most of the interior has been seen already'
p3748
aS' The roof though does a nice job of being interesting for a roof'
p3749
aS' A skylight, the edge rails, etc'
p3750
aS' And you can see there\'s not much "wrong color" in the walls'
p3751
aS' The "A" Model, Sides An interesting building when folded up'
p3752
aS' Very tall and skinny'
p3753
aS" You can tell it's not really meant to be displayed this way - it's meant to be open"
p3754
aS' The good - lots! I like the awning, the diagonal door, the flowerbox under the upper window, the folding gate on the balcony that lets it be used in open or closed mode, and the green / white / blue colors'
p3755
aS' The bad - well, the stairs end short of the upper door, I still don\'t really like the tan doorframes (I think black would have been better), and why don\'t the upper floors match up in size? The "A" Model, Leftovers Ah, that\'s more like it'
p3756
aS' Just a few small pieces left as spares'
p3757
aS' The Errors You might have to click through to the full-size versions, but I did catch a few weird errors in the manuals'
p3758
aS' First, in the photo of the newsstand, the map in the front corner is on there sideways'
p3759
aS' The map does have a clear north arrow printed on it'
p3760
aS" On the second image, the boy's feet are hanging off the edge"
p3761
aS' Just unusual to see an alignment error in the manual like that'
p3762
aS' The Comparison Here are this set and the modular Detective Office side by side'
p3763
aS" There's a huge difference - as you'd expect"
p3764
aS" But is the difference MORE than you'd expect? This set is 466 parts, $40"
p3765
aS' The DO is 2262 pieces and $160'
p3766
aS' 5 times the parts, 4 times the price'
p3767
aS" Looking at them side by side, I'd expect a bigger difference in both"
p3768
aS" The Conclusion So, what's my conclusion on this model? I love the main model, but the alternates are meh"
p3769
aS" It's a nice set for someone looking for a town building other than police and fire stations, but who isn't ready to move to the modular line"
p3770
aS' Compared to the modulars though, it seems overpriced'
p3771
aS' Part of that is because the huge modulars are actually a great deal compared to other Lego sets'
p3772
aS" I'm also a little surprised that it's so small, when you compare it to the City sets like a police station"
p3773
aS' Those are generally designed with much more open space, letting them be more of a playset'
p3774
aS" This one is small and cramped, so it'd be tougher to play in"
p3775
aS" It's not really a City set though"
p3776
aS" The Ratings Value: 7/10 - It's under the 10 cents a part mark, but that's largely due to having a TON of tiny parts"
p3777
aS" All those flowers and decorative 1x1 round studs add up quickly! Design: 7/10 - Good and bad on the colors, and there's a big difference between the quality of the main vs alternate models"
p3778
aS' Having so many leftover pieces is one thing when the Creator set makes 3 very different models (ie a boat, plane, and truck)'
p3779
aS" When it's 3 buildings, it seems wasteful to have so many parts leftover"
p3780
aS" Minifigs: 6/10 - I'm not sure they both fit the set"
p3781
aS" I suppose the boy is going to the toy store and the woman is going to the grocery? But there's no storekeeper in either"
p3782
aS" The woman doesn't look like a storekeeper to me, so that's why I assume she's another shopper"
p3783
aS' I love the boy, but the woman is just so-so - except that I do appreciate the head having two very different expressions'
p3784
aS" But again, that doesn't fit the set"
p3785
aS" I can't see her scared face being used"
p3786
aS" Playability: 6/10 - The shops are detailed with registers and so forth, but it's all so tiny it'd be hard to play with the figs in it"
p3787
aS' Parts: 9/10 - Tons of windows and doors, plus nice sand green bricks'
p3788
aS' But some things (the large blue curves used on the roof for example) are weirdly specialized and would be hard to use in another building design'
p3789
aS" Overall: 7/10 - I'd recommend doing what I did - build the alternates first, then the main since that's how you'll want to leave it"
p3790
aS" I'd really like to see the price a little lower compared to other sets (again, the part count is inflated due to SO MANY tiny parts) and the finished building is tiny, but it's loaded with neat details"
p3791
aS'Great review! Very thorough'
p3792
aS" It's not a set which makes me run to tye store, but it definitely has some fun elements"
p3793
aS' I do like your new grey background'
p3794
aS' Your pictures look great!'
p3795
aS'Any chance you have a picture of the News Stand next to the Detectives Office building as I would love to see the scaling for that?'
p3796
aS'Nice review mostlytechnic'
p3797
aS' I particularly like the use of grey background surface for the pictures'
p3798
aS' It somehow makes the building stand out more'
p3799
aS' Good job!'
p3800
aS"A terrific, very comprehensive review - but I'm not at all impressed with this set"
p3801
aS' It feels like a mishmash of bricks with no clear design aesthetic and as such blatantly underdeveloped (i'
p3802

aS' designed to hit a price/brick count point rather than provide a solid set in the Creator Town tradition)'

p3810
aS'Cheers for putting in the time to create a wonderful review'
p3811
aS' I am not a huge fan of this set; I like the colour combinations, but it all seems a bit all-too-simple'
p3812
aS' It can (and will) be nicely modularised, though!'
p3813
aS"Thanks 'mostlytechnic' for this review, I only brought this set to continue the shop series from creator"
p3814
aS" In my opinion it's only half as good as the bike shop/cafe one"
p3815
aS" Plus it doesn't fit the same as that pair of shops, oh well maybe next year Lego creator will have a better one"
p3816
aS" Brick On Review On 'mostlytechnic' !"
p3817

p3818
aS" It doesn't look that great on its own, but if you add the two sets together you get something that begins to look like a street scene"

aS' Brick On Review On \'mostlytechnic\' ! Well, it IS only half the price of the bike/cafe one too :) But I agree, it seems odd that they\'ve made a couple "shop" creator sets that don\'t fit together in style like this'
p3823

aS" It doesn't look that great on its own, but if you add the two sets together you get something that begins to look like a street scene"
p3826
aS" Interesting to get two comments right in a row with opposite opinions :) I don't have the bike/cafe set, but to me, they don't looks like they'd really go together"
p3827
aS" They're the same concept (two buildings that fold in half) but the sidewalk is different size and they just feel differently styled to me"
p3828
aS'This seems like half of a set compared to the previous Bike Shop/Cafe'
p3829
aS' As I like many of the elements, I will probably buy a second one and build a mirror image version (making one entirely a toy shop and the other a book store/news stand) and adjust the sidewalks to work with the previous model'
p3830
aS' Then I think they will work well together'
p3831
aS' I remember a little area in Copenhagen that had this sort of architecture'
p3832
aS' I would hope the subsequent models are better deigned to create more complex alternatives, but these are both good starting points for original or enhanced models'
p3833
aS'As a fan of Creator houses, I really want to like this set'
p3834
aS" However, I think that Creator houses have long filled a niche that's neglected elsewhere: residential houses"
p3835
aS" We haven't had a larger residential house since 2013; I'm not sure if these sets have anything to do with that, but it seems like they may be the replacement for larger houses"
p3836
aS" And I'd much rather have a larger house set than a set like this"
p3837
aS' I also agree with many others here; something about it just feels incomplete'
p3838
aS" I think that the various City business buildings we've gotten in recent years (including those in this year's City Square--which is much more expensive than this, but also contains much more) make for better buildings at this scale"
p3839
aS'Thanks andy_0306uk, your very clever strategic decision to serve us with blurry pictures allowed me to glance at this review without ruinating that whole wonderful Advent surprise too much'
p3840
aS' :-P *y* But although I loved the last year?s one, I think they could do another theme (or perhaps even two calendars), because right now Castle?s pretty hot IMO'
p3841
aS"Thank you Andy for your speed review! *y* So there?s nothing left to open while advent? ;-) I like all the tiny sets, it needn?t be another police- and fireman |-/ , but well, what would an advent calendar be without them? :-D One thing about the train traffic lights: TLC used to give us similar lights, but you could show either of the lights with the other one being covered: That one was waaay better! :'-( Just a little piece more would have done the thing"

p3847

The 05 version waf ok, the 06 version was better, with bigger sets, and more building ones! And the 07 is poor! It\'s just 2-3 pieces to put together on 2x4 plates'

Lego is really expanding with this advent calendar thing! Watch, next year they'll have ones for specific themes, Boy o boy, think about it, Star Wars Advent Calendar, Indy Advent claendar"
p3896
aS" Of course, this is only speculation, but it would be cool! X-D I'll probably buy both of these (even though I'm a boy ;-) ) so I get 2 surprises every day instead of one! :-P ;-)"
p3897
aS"I'm a big fan of anime and have watched some mechas like Full Metal Panic, Neon Evangelion: Genesis (it is a mecha!) and Chobits (Well"
p3898
aS' She is a robot'
p3899
aS'), so I was curious to see what this new Exo Force line was all about'
p3900
aS" The colorful sets and manga-like characters didn't persuade me right away, but the urgent need for a couple of white 3x3 wing plates made me purchase this little thing"
p3901
aS' It cost me 70 DKR as you can see on the box'
p3902
aS' This is 9'
p3903
aS'30 euro, or about the same an American has to pay for the new Republic Cruiser'
p3904
aS' Pretty expensive for so few pieces (90 + a spare technic pin) The box An action-packed box with one of the sides being oddly empty except from the LEGO-logo'
p3905
aS" What's inside There is a small building instruction, two polybags (no bag building here) and a sticker sheet with alarmingly many stickers"
p3906
aS" The build It takes so little time to build this set that I didn't get to take any pictures of the process"
p3907
aS' Every step was accompanied by an element description although I doubt most of you will need that with so few pieces to keep track on'
p3908
aS' Most of the dark green bricks have a sticker - even the slopes where the rough surface makes stickers fall off easily! There should also have been a sticker on the windshield, but I wanted to keep that piece clean for better usage later'
p3909
aS" (I'm one of those who keeps stickers on the bricks) The model You want to see this model from the front, as the back is pretty much neglected There isn't much for the pilot to grab a hold on either"
p3910
aS' He is pretty much a sitting duck up there with the screen giving him only partial cover'
p3911
aS' There is a huge wrench next to him which kind of symbolizes the crudeness of the mech'
p3912
aS' The set isn\'t called "Cyclone Defender" for nothing'
p3913
aS' The right arm might hold an ordinary light assault riffle, but the other has a spinning disc with samurai swords which you can turn with the yellow knob on the backside'
p3914
aS' Those of you who have seen Robot Wars might remember the incredible power of this melee weapon from a robot named Hypnodisc'
p3915
aS" It would have been nice had there been a pull-back motor to power the disc (I'm sure LEGO has a lot of these in stock), but the simple mechanism still works reasonably well"
p3916
aS' The riffle comes off and a pin makes it easy to hold with the hand, but the disc is fixed to the arm'
p3917
aS' It is also a problem that the swords get misaligned quickly during play'
p3918
aS' The minifig I really like this minifig because of the neat idea with an expression on each side that LEGO has made a standard for Exo Force'
p3919
aS" Posability Most mech-moc'ers show off their creations using Gundam-like poses"
p3920
aS' With two joints per leg (one being the ankles) and one for an arm I thought of some less serious poses: Crawling (Silent like a ninja!): Belly gliding: Kick off!; Upside down: Final Rating I have to disappoint you here'
p3921
aS' This is my first set in this line and I have absolutely no idea of how good it is'
p3922
aS' The last robot I bought was the awesome 6889 Spyrius Recon Robot for the same price, but it is in a completely different genre'
p3923
aS' The set had what I expected (two white wings) and is as such a no-nonsense set'
p3924
aS" I guess it would be of more use if you have some more Exo Force, which I don't"
p3925
aS' 6/10 Ups: Has great minifig, weapons and is easy to build'
p3926
aS' Downs: Crude design and a bit too expensive for what you get'

aS' A somehow mediocre mecha design, but a beautiful dark green color! Upside down mecha yoga exercises on! :-D'
p3930
aS'Nice review :) But'
p3931
aS' You paid HOW much? This set is priced around 7 Euros here in Germany, which is a very fair price for what you get in my oppinion'
p3932
aS' It?s a little disappointing though, that I couldn?t think of any alternate builds for this set, and there are no inspirations on the box or the EF website'
p3933
aS'9'
p3934
aS'30 euro is MSRP here in Denmark'
p3935
aS' 7 euro would have resulted in a nicer reception from my part, but the strong marked position of LEGO in its homeland together with the general high prices (because some of us are supposedly rich'
p3936
aS') makes the prices less bearable'
p3937
aS' It is funny you should mention Germany'
p3938
aS" I thought the prices for LEGO were even higher there! I'm sure I paid more than MSRP last time I bought LEGO from from your country"
p3939
aS' On the other hand'
p3940
aS' The last thing I bought was the 5521 Model Team sea jet from 1993!'
p3941
aS'I was going to buy one of these but decided not to'

aS' For the win! Did I read this wrong? You paid about the same price as the Republic Cruiser??! The Republic Cruiser costs $200 NZ, and the Cyclone Defencer costs $13'

p3956
aS"I couldn't find a review of this wonderful set in here, so here it goes! I got the set for MSRP (180kr = 24 euro) which is a fair price here in Denmark"
p3957
aS' As all other Creator sets there are instructions for several models (3 in this case)'
p3958
aS' The box The box is a little larger than City sets in the same price range'
p3959
aS' The primary model is shown on the front while you see the secondary ones on the back'
p3960
aS' What you get 312 pieces in 5 polybags and two building instructions: one for the primary model and the other for the rest'
p3961
aS' The built It was impossible for me to speed build this model because of the nifty functional details from the retractable landing gear to the wings that can turn by means of the handle in the back of the model'
p3962
aS' It took me a full hour to build it because I had to "test" how it all works together'
p3963
aS" The finished model The landing gear isn't fully enclosed when retracted and the models are sub-minifig scale, but I still love the design of the models"
p3964
aS' The doors for the rear wheels open as you pull the wheels down and the final piece of functionality comes from the wings that can either tilt (the horizontal stabilizers) or have elevators'
p3965
aS' Wing in, wings out, wings in, wings out'
p3966
aS' Ratings As a whole I actually like this set even more than the Big Rig'
p3967
aS' The models are just as diverse but the added functionality makes the plane more fun to play with than the rig'
p3968
aS' Price: 7/10 - A good price, but not a bargain as the Big Rig Design: 9/10 - There could have been a sligtly higher level of details in the main model, but all models are really good looking and I especially like the design of the hovercraft'
p3969
aS' Functionality: 10/10 - I guess you could ask for working rudders, opening cockpit and so on, but the plane is really filled with movable parts and the turning of the wings works really well'
p3970
aS' Secondary models: 7/10 - A hovercraft! How awesome is that!? If only the last model was just as inventive instead of a standard helicopter'
p3971
aS" Modifiability: 8/10 - The bricks are in ordinary colours and there is a good variety of them giving you plenty of possibilities for MOC'ing"
p3972
aS' You can easily make the main model into something that looks more like an F-14'
p3973
aS' 9/10 Probably as good as it gets for a Creator set in this price range'
p3974
aS' It is entertaining to both build and play with, looks good and the secondary models are worth building as well! (Brickshelf gallery)'
p3975
aS'Thanks! I was planning on doing this review but I have been a bit swamped lately'

aS' I bought this set for the swing-wing concept'
p3989
aS" I was very curious what TLC's design was like"
p3990
aS' I have been working on modifying it just a little to look more like the F-14'

aS" I think it is a really cool model, but The steering wheel doen't work too well"
p4001
aS" It doesn't turn easilly all the way around and when the craft turns, it doesn't stay stable on the three wheels because the front wheel turns quite alot into the opposite side"
p4002
aS' Now to the third model! This is quite a basic helicopter with the functionality of having the rotors turning'
p4003
aS" It doesn't use that many of the bricks and doesn't even have a landing gear"
p4004
aS' I have a question to all of you'
p4005
aS' As you can see, I prefer to show one or two large pictures and have the rest as clickable thumbnails'
p4006
aS" Most people use only the relatively big (typically 640x480) pictures so that you don't have to follow links"

p4085
aS' :-D'
p4086
aS'Does anyone have a box pic of this set? DP8'
p4087
aS'It is no secret that Marvel is one of the most successful companies right now'
p4088
aS' From the Avengers to the X-Men and down to even the most obscure characters like Ant-Man, every one of their movies has been a big hit until now'
p4089
aS" The latest Marvel movie, Fant4stic, was released last month and while I have not seen it yet, I'm sure it's just as great as their other movies"
p4090
aS' I mean, it has the word "Fantastic" in the title after all! And being the smart business that they are, The Lego Company decided to get in on the hype early and capitalize on this movie\'s undoubtful success two years in advance by making a set featuring Fant4stic\'s main villain, Dr'

p4094
aS' Doom! Dr'
p4095
aS" Doom and his henchman Beetle are attacking the Daily Bugle in their speedy jet to steal Spider-Man's secret identity"
p4096
aS" It's up to Spider-Man and Nova to swing in and stop them! Trigger the Daily Bugle's explosion functions to cause destruction as the jet fires missiles! Stop Dr"
p4097
aS" Doom from hitching the jet's anchor hook to the safe with Spider-Man's secret inside! Knock Beetle off the building with the swinging web attack and drop Dr"

aS' Includes Spider-Man, Nova, Dr'
p4100
aS' Doom, Beetle and J'
p4101
aS' Jonah Jameson with accessories and weapons'
p4102
aS" The first thing that comes to mind after reading this description is: Wow, that's a lot of TMs! Anyway, here are some resource links for this set: Brickset Bricklink Rebrickable The Box Since this set is based on the Ultimate Spider-Man cartoon, the box has the usual USM design with the red Marvel Super Heroes background, an illustration of Spidey in the upper right corner, and the USM logo in the lower right"
p4103
aS' As usual, there is a minifig line up in the lower left, and since this was before the terrible redesign, you can see the full body of the minifigs'
p4104
aS' I really miss this type of line up'
p4105
aS' There is quite a lot going on here: Doctor Doom attacking the Daily Bugle in his jet while simultaneously reaching for J'
p4106
aS" Jonah Jameson below with his jet's claw, Spider-Man (reluctantly) swings in to save him, while Nova fights off the Beetle"
p4107
aS" It's a pretty cool scene, even though it's not very accurate to the show"
p4108
aS' In "Beetle Mania", the episode that this set is based on, the Beetle was indeed out to kill JJJ, but it was in order to stop him from exposing his identity, not Spider-Man\'s (although Spidey was next on JJJ\'s list)'
p4109
aS" And while he is a recurring villain on the show, Doctor doom had nothing to do with this plot and didn't even appear in the episode aside from a brief cameo"
p4110
aS" It's awesome that they included him anyway, though, so I'm not gonna complain"
p4111
aS' Note that the tower is so tall that it wraps around the top of the box'
p4112
aS' There, you can also see a scale reference with the Spider-Man minifig'
p4113
aS' On the back of the box, you can see the interior of the Bugle and all of its play features which there are quite a few of since this is a playset'
p4114
aS" It's all illustrated pretty well, although Lego's choice of sound effects is still a mystery to me"
p4115
aS' I don\'t get why they don\'t go for Spider-Man\'s signature "Fwip!" instead of "Fazzing!" and I didn\'t know that a breaking window made the sound "Btoom!" but I digress'
p4116
aS' Contents Inside the box you will find three instruction booklets (one smaller than the others), a comic book, a fairly large sticker sheet, five numbered bags, and two loose pieces: A white string piece and a gray 16x8 plate'
p4117
aS" There aren't really any notable pieces and nobody cares about the comic bock (no offense to the artist), so lets get right to the instructions"
p4118
aS' They are pretty straight forward and easy to follow'
p4119
aS' Some of the pages have a ghostly image of Spidey, Nova, and Dr'
p4120
aS' Doom in the top right corner which is fitting since these are all minifigs that appear in this set (which is strangely not something that can be said for many other Super Heroes instructions with this type of artwork)'
p4121
aS" Minifigures As with most Super Heroes sets, most people will get this set mainly for the minifigs, so without further ado, let's talk about them"
p4122
aS' Spider-Man is the same old bootless one you get in almost every USM set'
p4123
aS' Not much to say about him'
p4124
aS" Some might complain that we don't get Spidey's alter ego Peter Parker in this set, but in the USM cartoon, MJ is actually the one who works at the Daily Bugle, not Peter"
p4125
aS' Curse the creators of this cartoon for ruining our chances of getting a new Peter Parker minifig by trying to mix things up'
p4126
aS' Next we get J'
p4127
aS' Jonah Jameson'
p4128
aS' He appeared in a Spider-Man 2 set before, but this is a complete redesign'
p4129
aS' He now has a blue suit with a red tie, a unique face print, and that combed-back hair in dark gray'
p4130
aS" This new hairpiece doesn't suit him at all and the old flat top hair was perfect for him in my opinion, so I don't know why they changed it"
p4131
aS' The good thing about this change, however, is the fact that this piece is exclusive to this set in that color'
p4132
aS' Nova on the other hand is spot-on'
p4133
aS' He comes with a new helmet mold and some nice torso printing'
p4134
aS' However, he, too, is missing his boots'
p4135
aS' TLC should have started making dual-colored legs a long time ago'
p4136
aS' Here are some reference images to compare them to'
p4137
aS" Okay, so JJJ's hair may not be completely black in the show, but I still think they should have given his minifig a black hairpiece"
p4138
aS' His suit is also not quite the right color'
p4139
aS' He rarely appears in person in the show (including the episode this set is based on) and is usually seen on screens around New York, so this is the best picture of him I could find'
p4140
aS' I guess I should be happy they included a minifig of him at all'
p4141
aS" In the episode, it was actually Mary Jane who was at the Bugle during Beetle's attack, so it would have made more sense to include her, but we got her in the Spider-copter set one year later, so that's ok"
p4142
aS' All three of them have back printing'
p4143
aS" In JJJ's case I'm using that term loosely since it is only comprised of two lines, but it's nice that they went through the trouble of adding them"
p4144
aS' Both JJJ and Nova come with angry alternate faces'
p4145
aS" It almost looks like they're trying to out-angry each other"
p4146
aS' Who do you think looks angrier? Let me know in the comments section below'
p4147
aS" Now let's talk about the bad guys"
p4148
aS" Even though he would be better off in a Fantastic Four set, it's great to finally get Victor Van Doom, one of the greatest Marvel villains ever and in comics in general"
p4149
aS' He comes with a dark green hood which was new and exclusive in that color at the time, and he is the only minifig in this set that has leg printing'
p4150
aS' Beetle is a regular minifig with wings'
p4151
aS' The metallic printing on his face and torso is pretty nice, but I wish it would have continued onto his legs as well'
p4152
aS' The Beetle looks quite accurate to his on-screen counterpart'
p4153
aS' The only thing that could have improved him is a new helmet mold with pointy eyebrows/antennae'
p4154
aS' Doctor Doom, however, looks nothing like he does in the movie'
p4155
aS" I just don't understand how Lego could have messed him up so badly"
p4156
aS' Maybe they were working off of early concept art or something'
p4157
aS' Here is a back view of Doom and Beetle'
p4158
aS" Beetle would be a pretty boring minifig if it wasn't for his wings which are awesome with their holographic texture"
p4159
aS' They are so mesmerizing, I could look at those things all day'
p4160
aS' This piece also appeared in trans'
p4161
aS' light green in the Galaxy Squad sets which came out at the same time'
p4162
aS' Here they are without their gear'
p4163
aS' As you can see, they both have back printing as well'
p4164
aS" And no, Doctor Doom does not come with an alternate facial expression, which is fine since you can't see much of his expressions due to his mask anyway"
p4165
aS" Here's a look at Dr"
p4166
aS' Doom and Nova without their headgear'
p4167
aS" Some say that Doom's face looks too cartoony, but I think it looks fine"
p4168
aS' Nova is wearing stylish goggles as a way of explaining his white eyes'
p4169
aS" It's a far better explanation than the Bat-sweatband"
p4170
aS' They did the same thing with the masked Wolverine later'
p4171
aS' Here are all the figs with their accessories'
p4172
aS' JJJ comes with a camera so that he can take "more pictures of Spider-Man!" Beetle comes with one of those overused ADU guns which is a very poor representation of his wrist-mounted blasters'
p4173
aS' I hate to say it, but even those bulky new stud shooters would have been a better representation of his weapons'
p4174
aS' Spidey comes with his usual string of webbing and Nova comes with some Iron Man style translucent studs'
p4175
aS' The weird thing is that they are red while his powers have a blue glow in the show'
p4176
aS" Doctor Doom sadly doesn't get any accessories, but who needs weapons when you have a jet with a claw and flick-fire missiles"
p4177
aS' The Build The first bag contains Spider-Man, a brick separator, and the parts to build the ground floor of the DBC building'
p4178
aS' After a quick and straight-forward build, you get this'
p4179
aS' The dumpster and street lamp are separate from the building and since the lamp post is not built onto any baseplate and is quite top-heavy, it gets knocked over pretty easily'
p4180
aS" Maybe it's meant to be that way, but I would have preferred it if you could stick it onto the baseplate of the building on which there is unfortunately not enough space to do so"
p4181
aS' As you would expect, the second bag has the parts for the first floor of the building'
p4182
aS' This is also the bag that contains Beetle'
p4183
aS" After another fairly simple build, you'll find yourself with a two story building with a spiderweb one side and a fire escape on the other"
p4184
aS' However, you have to apply three stickers during this section of the build which is never fun'
p4185
aS" Can you guess what's in bag number 3? Yup, the second floor of the building"
p4186
aS" You don't need superpowers to predict that one"
p4187
aS' Also, this bag contains Nova and Jameson'
p4188
aS' The build of this section is a bit repetitive since the second floor is mostly the same as the first and it takes slightly longer to build since you have to build the rooftop as well'
p4189
aS' Also, in addition to the two window stickers you have to apply ten 2x2 tile stickers! Trying to do this without having any of them being crooked is a real pain in the megablocks'
p4190
aS' The next bag contains Doctor Doom and the cockpit of his jet'
p4191
aS" Doom's cape is in the usual square white box and the string for the claw is folded up in a piece of tape"
p4192
aS" Here's what you get at the end of this section"
p4193
aS' Looks more like an escape pod than a jet at this point'
p4194
aS' The final bag is the smallest as it only includes the few parts needed to finish the Doom jet'
p4195
aS" Once you build the wings and tail, you stick them onto the cockpit via Technic pins and you're done"
p4196
aS' Spare Parts These are the parts that are left over after the build'
p4197
aS' There is the brick separator of course, an extra antenna, and the usual little bits and bops'
p4198
aS" What's really awesome, though, is that they give you an extra pair of Beetle's wings! Considering what a neat piece this is and that this is the only set in which it comes in trans-black make this a very welcome spare that you can use in your customs"
p4199
aS' The Finished Set Here is the complete set'
p4200
aS' The DBC building looks quite tall, especially when you count the antenna'
p4201
aS' Comparing it to a screenshot from the episode, the general look of the building is there, although there are some inaccuracies'
p4202
aS' Aside from the fact that it is obviously way down-scaled, the screens that show JJJ ranting about Spider-Man should have been hexagonal, not square, and should have wrapped around the building'
p4203
aS" However, considering how many stickers you would have had to apply if they would have made it accurate, I'm actually glad they kept the screen mercifully small"
p4204
aS" Much like Doctor Doom himself, the Doom jet didn't actually appear in the Beetle Mania episode"
p4205
aS' However, it did appear in a later episode titled "Not A Toy" in which Spider-Man plays around with Captain America\'s shield, accidentally drops it in Doctor Doom\'s Latvarian embassy and has to try to retrieve it'
p4206
aS' And yes, that episode was as godawful as it sounds'
p4207
aS" Here's a screenshot of the jet from that episode"
p4208
aS" Like with the DBC, they managed to capture the general shape of the vehicle, although it doesn't look quite as good as in the show"
p4209
aS' The color scheme is too dark and it looks kind of blockier'
p4210
aS" Let's take a closer look at the jet"
p4211
aS' There is no real way to reel the claw in unfortunately'
p4212
aS' However, there is a stud on the back of the jet that you can stick it onto'
p4213
aS' Needless to say, this is not the ideal way of storing it'
p4214
aS' I would have much preferred it if they would have attached it onto winch instead'
p4215
aS" The engines on the wings can be turned, even though they don't turn in the show, and there is a flick-fire missile on each side"
p4216
aS" Even if it's not much to look at, at least it's a very swooshable vehicle"
p4217
aS' On top of each wing there is a tile with the emblem of Latvaria'
p4218
aS" There was no such emplems on the jet in the cartoon, but they are useful pieces that make it clear whose jet it is, so I'm glad they included them"
p4219
aS' There is nothing inside the cockpit except for a seat and unless you want to ruin Dr'
p4220
aS" Doom's nice dark green cape, I wouldn't put him inside of it"
p4221
aS' They could have at least printed a control panel onto that empty 2x2 tile'
p4222
aS" Play Features Since this is a playset, let's look at all the play features it has to offer"
p4223
aS' Like all playsets, the building is open in the back so you can play inside'
p4224
aS' On the ground floor, there is a potted plant and'
p4225
aS' nothing else'
p4226
aS" Seriously? Is this all they could come up with for this floor? They could have included a security desk, a lounge, a second plant, or anything else! As it is, it's just a boring empty lobby"
p4227
aS' The first floor is a bit more interesting'
p4228
aS' There is a safe, a swiveling chair, and a pin board with various pictures of Spider-Man'
p4229
aS' There is one tile that reads: "The true identity of Spider-Man" which is supposedly what the villains are after'
p4230
aS' I wonder how Jameson got this information in the first place'
p4231
aS' Speaking of Jameson, the second floor is devoted to his office where he can sit and yell at his non-present employees, demanding "more pictures of Spider-Man!" It also has a swiveling chair as well as a desk with a lamp and a computer'
p4232
aS" There is a Technic beam connecting his desk with the ceiling of the first floor which you can remove in order to take off the upper half of the building, but it's difficult to do, so I don't recommend it"
p4233
aS' As you may have noticed in the picture above, there are a few red pegs sticking out of the building'
p4234
aS' These are for triggering the play features'
p4235
aS' Most of them are on the roof'
p4236
aS' There is one on what looks like an air conditioning unit'
p4237
aS' If you place Spider-Man holding is web-string on the jumper plate in front of it and push the peg, Spidey goes bungee-jumping off the building'
p4238
aS' Wee! There is also one that sticks out of the side of the building which when pulled triggers a trap door'
p4239
aS' The third red peg on the roof can be used to pop off the DBC sign'
p4240
aS' Why is it called the DBC, you ask? It stands for Daily Bugle Communications since in this version of Spider-Man, the Daily Bugle is not only a newspaper, but a news TV station as well, one that promotes its own highly biased views'
p4241
aS' So basically the Fox News of the Marvel universe'
p4242
aS' I guess if you\'re an old school Spider-Man fan, you could just leave off the "C" and have it just stand for Daily Bugle'
p4243
aS' The sign above the main entrance wont be so easily modified however'
p4244
aS' There is also a peg between the first and second floor which when pushed pops out one of the windows on the first floor'
p4245
aS" The safe is only attached to a couple of jumper plates and has some jumper plates on top of it as well, so you can easily attach the Doom jet's claw to it and rip it out of the building as seen on the back of the box"
p4246
aS' There are also some SNOT bricks on the corners of the building that you can attach spiderwebs or Spidey himself onto for some wall-crawling and webslinging action'
p4247
aS' This is not so much a play feature as it is just a feature, but as I mentioned earlier, there is a fire escape on the left side of the building'
p4248
aS' This was a neat idea as it helps it feel like a building in New York City, but it is executed very poorly'
p4249
aS' There is no hole big enough for the minifigs to climb down through, so they would have to climb down the ladders from the outside which makes no sense'
p4250
aS' No wonder Spider-Man always needs to rescue people from burning buildings'
p4251
aS' There is one more play feature in the form of the dumpster'
p4252
aS' You can open the lid, put a minifig inside, and make them jump by hitting a tab in the back'
p4253
aS" Remember, this is before the introduction of super jumpers, but nevertheless it's a pretty strange place to launch minifigs out of"
p4254
aS' I guess even Super Heroes like to do some dumpster diving'
p4255
aS" You don't think this was funny? No? Well, me neither, but that's the type of humor that this show loves to use"
p4256
aS' Sigh'
p4257
aS" Anyway, let's get on to the ratings"
p4258
aS' Ratings Design: 2/5 - The set looks ok'
p4259
aS" Despite many inaccuracies, the DBC building and the jet somewhat resemble their on-screen counterparts and don't look too bad, but they definitely could be better"
p4260
aS' Build: 1/5 - A mostly unchallenging and repetitive build with an attrocious amount of stickers'
p4261
aS' Minifigs: 4/5 - Definitely the strongest point of the set'
p4262
aS' Some of the figs could be better, but four out of five of them are exclusive to this set'
p4263
aS" Doctor Doom is easily the best and probably the most desirable one - unless the Fant4stic movie portraits him so badly that nobody will be interested in him, but that's impossible"
p4264
aS' Playability: 4/5 - As you would expect from a playset, the playability is quite high, although I still feel like there could have been more'
p4265
aS' Parts: 3/5 - Not many rare parts'
p4266
aS" If you're looking for parts for building your own skyscraper with tan walls and lots of doors and windows though, this set is for you"
p4267
aS' Price: 3/5 - At 476 parts for $50, this set is a bit pricey, but it is somewhat justified by all the large window and wall pieces'
p4268
aS' Overall: 3/5 - This set is mediocre at best'
p4269
aS' Playsets are always a good choice for Spider-Man sets since they give Spidey something to swing from, but unfortunately they are rarely pulled off well'
p4270
aS' The jet is blocky, the building is bare-bones, and the price feels too high'
p4271
aS' The only reason to get this set are the four exclusive minifigs'
p4272
aS' This set was discontinued early this year, but if you still see it on clearance somewhere, go ahead and get one for the minifigs and parts, or buy multiples and use the parts to build a better DBC building'
p4273
aS' I hope you enjoyed this review'
p4274
aS" It is part of the Reviewers Academy's 7th Anniversary"
p4275
aS" We're not doing a big celebration this year due to other commitments, but look out for more reviews with the 7th Anniversary banner soon"
p4276
aS" Now, if you'll excuse me, I am off to see Fant4stic"
p4277
aS" I hope it's as fantastic as it promises to be! (2 hours later) I was wrong! I was horribly, horribly wrong!"

p4279

aS' On the poorer side of ok'

aS"png There's not much to say really"
p4326
aS' Doom in USM looks just like he does in the comics, and Lego recreated that look perfectly'
p4327
aS" Again, he's definitely the best part of this set"
p4328
aS"I'm glad you were joking about Doom"
p4329
aS" I'm not that big of a fanboy, but I had the need to correct you for some reason"
p4330
aS' With that said, I bought this set for the minifigures a few years ago'
p4331
aS" Looking back, I don't really care about the figures today like I did in 2013"
p4332
aS' The building is decent for the size of the set though'

aS' Thanks for the review'

aS"For those of you who are old enough to remember System Shock: Next on Maury: Who's the Father? Edited by DarthBrickus, 15 September 2015 - 05:28 PM"
p4335
aS'Overall, I wish Marvel in particular would have more playsets in its theme (Batman has several great ones in the DC theme)'
p4336
aS" But then again, if this is the best playset to date for Marvel, maybe it's better just to leave well enough alone"
p4337
aS' I would definitely like to see them attempt something in the $100+ (US) price range because I think it could be good; Marvel needs an equivalent to the Arkham Asylum set'
p4338
aS' Regarding this set, I saved myself some money and bought the 4 minifigs I needed (all but Spidey) on Bricklink for less than half the set price'
p4339
aS' Edited by dmarvin, 17 September 2015 - 06:25 PM'
p4340
aS'Personally, I thought your review was spot on and I very much enjoyed your tone'
p4341
aS" I'm not usually much of a mini-fig person, but I will admit I bought this set mostly for Dr"
p4342
aS' Doom (and considered Nova a bonus)'
p4343
aS' Growing up, I was a big fan of the Fantastic Four and an even bigger fan of Dr Doom'
p4344
aS" I hope that someday the film rights will revert to Marvel and we'll finally get a FF film that respects the original source material and features a Dr Doom worthy of the name"
p4345
aS" As for the set itself, I don't have much use for playsets (not that there's anything wrong with them, I think the Marvel Lego line could use more of them in fact) and I didn't even realize it was linked to a specific show as I've fallen a bit out of touch with the franchise of late"
p4346
aS' I bought it; I built it; it sat a shelf for a while; I scrapped it for parts'
p4347
aS' I think most of it wound up as a greenhouse for my winter village set-up'
p4348
aS" It's not a _bad_ set, but I think you summed things up nicely when you called it mediocre"
p4349
aS' Thanks for the entertaining review'
p4350
aS'Thanks for the review'
p4351
aS"I'm not a big fan of Spider Man sets, but this set really impressed me"
p4352
aS' This must because of the design of this set and the minifigures that included in this set'
p4353
aS"I think I'm the only person in the world who likes Fant4stic"
p4354
aS" Was it the best superhero movie? Not even close, but I didn't think it deserved the hate it got"
p4355
aS' It was just incredibly and clumsily mishandled'
p4356
aS' Anyways, great review'
p4357
aS' I might pick this one up if only for the Beetle fig'
p4358
aS'This set seems to appeal more to the non superhero crowd'
p4359
aS' It is one of the only marvel sets I bought'
p4360
aS' Mainly because I thought that the building was a nice return to the old style of city sets'
p4361
aS' I would love to see this sort of backdrop for a more realistic agents theme'
p4362
aS' I also liked that most of the figs in this set were easier to merge into other (non-super) uses'
p4363
aS' Thanks for the review! God Bless, Nathan'

p4452
aS' UCS sets should have a different iconography like they did in the past'
p4453

p4454
aS'The Manual: The gigantic manual measures 17? x 12? and is almost an inch thick'
p4455
aS' It is spiral bound with a cardboard like front and back and it is 314 pages'
p4456
aS' Interesting decision not to break it up into multiple manuals'
p4457
aS' It is almost unwieldy at this size and thickness'
p4458
aS' Unfortunately, the manual is not available electronically from the LEGO website'
p4459
aS' Hopefully, it will be soon'
p4460
aS' Missing were the little instructions at the beginning telling you to not build this beast on shag carpet and to sort out the 5,000+ pieces before you get started'
p4461
aS' I guess they figure if you got $500 to spend on this thing, you can build it however you want'
p4462
aS" As usual, we get the regular LEGO manual features: - Piece call outs for each step - Parts inventory at the end of the manual - Page numbers - Photos of all the other 2007 sets at the end of the manual Manual (paperback book provided for scale) Various manual photos (8x8 plate provided for scale) I'm about 2 hours into building and sorting"
p4463
aS" I'm trying to stay a day ahead in my posting"
p4464
aS' The build has been easier than I thought so far'
p4465
aS' Despite the massive number of pieces, it has not been too hard to sort and find what you need'

p4477

p4481
aS' So this leads me to believe that dimension-wise the UCS MF is more compact'
p4482
aS' Also, notice how in the content, the parts fit in just nice without additional spare space for anything else'
p4483
aS" Strange isn't it that when TLC is responsible for the shipping, we see optimum usage of box spaces"

aS'good review'
p4488
aS" *y* Me, I can't build it before Saturday"
p4489
aS'Great review so far! I am looking forward to additional posts! As for the number of pins - from the Peeron inventory for the set, there are over 400 technic pins of various lengths! (insert the "my fingers hurt from building" emoticon) Keep the pictures coming!'
p4490
aS'The Build: The build is going quicker than I thought'
p4491
aS' I am sorting as I open the bags that I need'
p4492
aS' Some bags are in multiples so it is easy to pick them out'
p4493
aS' The build is a tad repetitive as the framework of the ship is somewhat symmetrical'
p4494
aS' Here are some progress shots: Note that two plates (1x4 and 1x8) are stacked in between Technic beams'
p4495
aS' Then the part below is assembled to hold the structure together'
p4496
aS" This took about an hour of sorting and building: I'll post another update tomorrow"
p4497
aS'The Minifigs: As you can see, the minifigs are really nice'
p4498
aS' They even throw in an extra fleshie head! No doubt these will fetch quite a bit on the Bricklink and Ebay markets'
p4499
aS' I?m keeping mine'
p4500
aS' Continuing the Build This photo shows how well this model is put together'
p4501
aS' Notice that they use four of the three-hole beams per side to hold this together'
p4502
aS' I remember reading that you can hang this model from the ceiling'
p4503
aS' I don?t doubt it'
p4504
aS' These right angle Technic pieces are used to reinforce the structure of the model'
p4505
aS' You can see them used here: I was shocked at how many light gray plates are in this set'
p4506
aS' I have TWO tubs full of these: The infrastructure is now complete: I got hung up for about an hour looking for one of these: Turns out, LEGO gave me an extra left wedge and shorted me a right wedge'
p4507
aS' So frustrating! I had to stead one off my 6211 Star Destroyer'
p4508
aS' It is not a very common piece by the way?'
p4509
aS'Hey nice review, im up to about the same point as you (page 70 to be exact) , tho i didnt have that missing piece thankfully! I think lego have done a much better job at packing the lego this time, i remember it taking me much longer to find pieces on the UCS ISD build'
p4510
aS'So I see they even do mistakes on these |-/ That beast looks really sturdy !! That is great !! Are these yellow parts new ? I am not a Technic fan and never saw these before'
p4511
aS' Another question for you: is the instruction book easy to follow, especially regarding the colours'
p4512
aS" Does the black rally stands out comparing to the dark bley and so on ? I sure hope so ;-) Can't wait to see moer hehe *yoda*"

p4518
aS' If you want tan, this is the set to get! Main model'
p4519
aS' The garage is a great addition'
p4520
aS'but the car only just fits! The main house is very nice looking'
p4521
aS' The windows extend to the sides'
p4522
aS'but not the back'
p4523
aS' The chimney and drainage work very well, and I love the "basement"'
p4524
aS' I think the front works very well'
p4525
aS' When I was making this I was multitasking doing weight training; do a set, do a step, do a set'
p4526
aS' and I ended up missing one of the row paths'
p4527
aS' I discovered this after I finished the basement'
p4528
aS' :-| The removable roof reveals BYO floors'
p4529
aS' Probably why this is called a Model house! The roof was quite interesting to build'
p4530
aS' This is my first large house set so it all was very new to me'
p4531
aS' I love the garage door'
p4532
aS' More nice pipework'
p4533
aS" This photo I mis-focused but there isn't much to see anyway! The door is a nice touch"
p4534
aS' The grill to the right on both sides is not just decoration as it hides the hinges for the door'
p4535
aS' I also made one of the sub-models'
p4536
aS' I was considering keeping this but I decided against it'
p4537
aS' Once again the sides have windows'
p4538
aS" but the back doesn't"
p4539
aS" The truck is there to make the photo more worthwhile! The roof to this one doesn't come off easily as all the tiles are used for the front"
p4540
aS" Just to clarify; these houses aren't attached so you can arrange them however you want"
p4541
aS' The fronts are quite elaborate and it seems that Lego were trying to make this almost like a simpler market street'
p4542
aS' The truck is too small for a minifig'
p4543
aS'but it probably was my favourite car'
p4544
aS' Thoughts I highly recommend this set'
p4545
aS' In most countries it is good value for money, including Australia'
p4546
aS' The design is excellent and three instructions are included'
p4547
aS' (The third is a school'
p4548
aS' If anyone has made it and wants to post photos feel free! At least one person at EB has made it'
p4549
aS') I love how each house has its own car'
p4550
aS' Due to the way the primary model is made it is a bit weak at the corner, but that was a design choice'
p4551
aS' My only real complaint about this set is how Lego is going though a mould transition and thus some roof slopes are rough, others are smooth'
p4552
aS' I can accept either, and Lego has been moving to smooth slopes for years now, but to have a set with about 50/50 is annoying'
p4553
aS' (The MTT was the same'
p4554
aS') But that is my only gripe with this excellent set'
p4555
aS' *wub*'
p4556
aS"Thanks for the review, and tons of pics! I've been wanting to pick this one up since I saw it"
p4557
aS' I thought the 4956 Creator House was nice, but this Model Town House is in a completely different league! I also like the alternate models that you can see in the catalogues'
p4558
aS'Thank you for the review Sinner'
p4559
aS' At first I wanted this set for the 4 blue 1x1 slope tiles, but I can see there is much more into it than that'
p4560
aS' It sure is a great value compared to what you get in the Building Bonanzas (no cars and less detail)'
p4561
aS' It was funny to see the little side story in your pictures'
p4562
aS' Would it be hard to modify the cars to fit minifigs better?'
p4563

aS" I still wouldn't mind it though"

aS' :-D Lasse D, on Sep 28 2007, 08:03 AM, said: Would it be hard to modify the cars to fit minifigs better? The problem with the blue truck is a lack of headroom'

p4591
aS'Awesome review! Luckily you have two cute little friends and one beautiful lady to help you out! :-P I likewise love *wub* this set and your review does it credit! I laughed outloud a lot as I read it'

aS' I especially love you trying to look through the windowless back :-D :-D :-D Great job, now sort that out and start building for our competition! X-D'
p4593
aS"Excellent review with great pics and cameo appearances by some of our EB favs *y* Definitely a set that was on my 'to get' list already, and this only confirms that"
p4594
aS" Might make me want two, just because I love tan so much and I'd like to see if something could be done to bulk up that car"
p4595
aS' Great job as always! :-)'
p4596
aS'Thank you very much for the review Sinner'
p4597
aS' I definitly *wub* this set'
p4598
aS' This will make a great addition for us "Townies"'
p4599
aS' I thought the size was too small'
p4600
aS' I plan to make my house fit practically the whole baseplate'
p4601
aS' Plus I will definitly add floors, that looked :-D '
p4602
aS" I can't believe TLC skimped on the floors"
p4603
aS'Thanks for this review Sinner! I love this house, with the nicely made tiled corners, the colorscheme and the garage'
p4604
aS' The only thing I dislike about this set is the way the windows are attached in train windows (so they turn inwards a little) instead of the usual frames with shutter-attachment-ability'
p4605
aS' But that is something that can be fixed in the blink of an eye'
p4606
aS' I will certainly buy this house some day when I find it at reasonable price'

aS' X-D Definitely a must buy for every townie'
p4611
aS' You get tons of useful parts to build other buildings as well'

aS' [shameless self-promotion /OFF] ;-) You have to love tan bricks though'
p4613
aS' 8-| MOC ON!'
p4614
aS'I too have bought this set and the only thing I notice which is a bit odd, with the exception of there being no floors in the house is the lack of a steering wheel in the car!'
p4615
aS'Thanks for the review Sinner! I definitely want this set now'
p4616
aS' The mixed rough and smooth roof bricks would annoy me on a model like the MTT, but here it looks as is if the roof is quite old with some parts being worn and pitted and some parts being replaced with new roof tiles'
p4617
aS' I quite like the effect'
p4618
aS" I agree on which is the best vehicle, and if it doesn't fit minifigs, just mod the heck out of it! X-D"

p4620
aS" It didn't bother me as I downloaded the instructions prior to buying the set"
p4621
aS' I think it was a deliberate choice to make the house flashy looking but not very functional'
p4622
aS" Due to the cool looking corners it isn't very strong either; while breaking it I was reminded of a zip! :-P simonwillems, on Sep 28 2007, 06:53 PM, said: The only thing I dislike about this set is the way the windows are attached in train windows (so they turn inwards a little) instead of the usual frames with shutter-attachment-ability"

aS' We built this set for a total of 3 hours, to complete this beauty, in about 2 hours ago'
p4645
aS' There are stars circling around my head at this very moment, when I post this reply'
p4646
aS' I must admit from the bottom of my heart, that this is an wonderful piece of house, that simply shows the beauty of it, with the European kind of houses, where there is a garage'
p4647
aS' Furthermore, there is a lovely blue car'
p4648
aS' I am seeing stars right now, in the middle of the night, and I must drop a thanks to you personally as well'
p4649
aS' Although it is empty from its interior unlike the 4996 Beach House, but this set has the majestic look which simply place a "Wow" factor in front of it upon completion'
p4650
aS' At the moment, we had plans for getting the second set next month, to build the other design as well'
p4651

aS'Nice pictorial review, I always like this little set ! A little more text would have been nice but that is ok as it is '
p4672
aS' PS: You should have mentioned in the title that this topic is picture heavy - I was wondering why it was loading so slow on my mobile'
p4673
aS"Hi, You've done well on the pictures! But I agree with Freekysch; a little more text would be great"
p4674
aS" Ever thought about joining the Reviewer's Academy?"
p4675
aS'Thanks for comments'
p4676
aS" I know about text, I'm trying to write more, but haven't succes in this yet"
p4677
aS" I thought about joining Reviewers Academy, but I'm not sure because I have only maimum 4(may be 5) hours each time when I can make review or something that needs some hours"
p4678
aS'Writing a decent review will indeed take some time'
p4679
aS" But you don't need to do it in a single session"
p4680
aS' If "each time" is 4/5 hours, you can write a review in 2 x "each time"'

aS'i actually bought this set last Monday as it was reduced to 14'
p4682
aS'99'
p4683
aS'it actually not a bad little set considering the size and part count, has a decent array of functions'
p4684
aS' its a nice little set'
p4685
aS'the B model looks just as good so i might buy a second set, as you get the bucket left over and i need that bucket for another set'

aS' Edited by Richard Dower, 19 October 2015 - 04:42 PM'
p4687
aS'Remember when I said in my review of 7090 to expect a review after I went to ToysRus? Well, somehow things didn?t work out, but fortunately I?m finally reviewing my latest purchases, starting with 7091 Catapault Defense, which happens to be one of the best sets in the Castle line'
p4688
aS' The Box and Instructions: Lego box art is at it?s highest point ever these days, with lots of special effects and great action poses'
p4689
aS' The castle theme is no exception, and 7091 isn?t either'
p4690
aS' I?ll let the box speak for itself: I love the back of the castle boxes as well, since they give another action scene and other neat info like a layout of all the accessories'
p4691
aS' The Contents: Only the bare essentials as usual: piece bags and instructions'
p4692
aS' I seriously wish they still put mini catalogs inside sets like they did when I was young, but I guess they are too expensive to make or something'
p4693
aS' Ah well, can?t have everything'
p4694
aS' No picture of the instructions this time, but since that isn?t necessary I?ll just say that they are fine, and do not have a problem with distinguishing dark gray from black'
p4695
aS' The Pieces: Here?s your basic shot of every piece included, minus a few extra pieces like an extra Viking horn and black skeleton leg'
p4696
aS' Not too shabby for a 10 USD set'
p4697
aS' There?s a lot of nice pieces in 7091, as you can see (and this doesn?t include the accessories or minifig parts!)'
p4698
aS' The brown plates, wheels, and spoked things are always useful, and the dark blue and gold slopes are really cool'
p4699
aS' However, there?s also a fair amount of technic in here, so be warry'
p4700
aS' As usual for the castle line, 7091 has a heaping helping of accessories'
p4701
aS' Most of them are old pieces recolored, but the ball on chain (what?s the actual name, could someone tell me?) and the shields are brand new'
p4702
aS' I actually like the new skeleton weapon, since it?s fairly detailed and was really the only way TLC could make a part like that'
p4703
aS' And yes, the shields ARE printed (quite nicely too, if I do say so myself)'
p4704
aS' Plus, you get Viking horns (always useful to have), a grey boulder, a basket, and 3 helmets'
p4705
aS' Not a half bad deal, eh? Oh, who am I kidding ? it?s awesome! Minifigures: Ah yes, one of the highlights of any castle set'
p4706
aS' You get 2 soldiers and 2 skellies this time, all with different weapons'
p4707
aS' The two soldiers are just regular Crown troops with different faces ? nothing special, except that they are awesome anyway'
p4708
aS' The skeletons on the other hand are much more interesting: an archer and a black skellie! Archers cool, of course, but I know many don?t like the printing on the black skeletons'
p4709
aS' Well, let me say that I don?t mind it so much'
p4710
aS' The only real problem is that the eyes are dark red instead of just red, which makes the printing a bit less noticeable'
p4711
aS' And I?ve been through it before that the new skeleton molds in general don?t bother me at all ? go skeletons! The Finished Set: Alright, there?s two builds in this set, and I?ll start with the smaller: the skeleton barricade'
p4712
aS' Okay, so it?s nothing special, but it?s cool all the less'
p4713
aS' The shield on the front and the slanted spears are nice touches'
p4714
aS' Here?s just how the skeletons can tower over their own barricade: with a little step'
p4715
aS' Ah, the catapault'
p4716
aS' The lovely catapault'
p4717
aS' Seriously, I love TLC?s design'
p4718
aS' Very effective, and also very realistic, especially compared to KK'
p4719
aS' Love the side details and the swiveling base, and you gotta love the clever use of that basket'
p4720
aS' Playability: Yes, I?ve made it a tradition now to write stories for any castle set I buy (and this isn?t the last one, you can be sure of that!)'
p4721
aS' Here?s one featuring everything in 7901: Oh, and here?s a small ship I made out of all the pieces in this set plus a couple extra figures and weapons from my copy of 7901'
p4722
aS' Not half bad, IMO, considering what I had to work with'
p4723
aS' Overall Rating: Presentation: 9/10 Pieces: 8/10 Minifigures: 9/10 Finished model: 9/10 Playability: 8/10 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Final Score: 8'
p4724
aS'6/10 Once again, I highly recommend the reviewed set'
p4725
aS' Castle is possibly the best theme this year, and this set is one of many that prove it'
p4726
aS' As with all castle sets, it?s best if you buy several if you want to truly enjoy it, but this set alone is also impressive in both design and pieces and minifigures'
p4727
aS' Get at least one if you have even a slight liking for Castle'

p4780
aS' These sets have been very popular, especially among AFOLs, and are always highly anticipated'
p4781
aS" However, while some entries in this series have been more popular than others, none has been as controversial as this year's set, the Winter Toy Shop, which is a re-release of the first Winter Village set, 10199 Winter Toy Shop from 2009"
p4782
aS" It seems that many think that this set didn't need to be remade and would have preferred a new set instead, or that it is not different enough from the original and will be redundant in a completionist's collection"
p4783
aS" Does it deserve all the hate? Let's find out"

aS' They also want to make sure that you know that there are batteries included by saying it in dozens of languages'
p4801
aS' The top of the box features the inventory and a 1:1 scale reference with the female caroler'
p4802
aS" On the bottom there is a picture that reminds you that there is a light brick included in this set, in case that wasn't clear from the front of the box, and it confirms that yes, it is a bad idea to put it in water, in case you were planning to go swimming with your Winter Toy Shop"
p4803
aS' The Contents Inside the box there are two instruction booklets and two groups of bags, one for each instruction booklet'
p4804
aS" While two groups of bags is not as many as there usually are in other sets of this size, it's still better than the first version of this set where the bags weren't numbered at all, so this makes the build a bit easier"
p4805
aS' The large bag in Group 1 and the two large bags in Group 2 have a white stripe going down the middle of the bag and only have one group number printed on it along with some other number and some kind of scan code'
p4806
aS' I have no idea why they made this distinction for these bags or what that code is for, so if any of you know the purpose of this, please let me know in the comments below'
p4807
aS' Here is a random instructions page'
p4808
aS" As you can see, the building steps can get quite challenging as they sometimes include many different pieces in one step, especially when it uses a lot of brown pieces which are very dark and hard to see in the instructions, living up to the set's status as an expert-level set"
p4809
aS' Most of the time, though, the instructions are pretty clear and easy enough to follow'
p4810
aS" There are some parts in new colors in this set that weren't in the first version or any other set until now, such as that large, flat Technic arch in dark green, the jester hat in orange and blue, one of those new 2z2 round jumper tiles in brown, a golden frog(!), and a snowboard in dark blue"
p4811
aS" There are also some rare Friends parts that make their Creator debut here such as the skis in azure and that new clear 1x1 round tile with a tiny tube coming out of it which is usually used as a stand for Friends accessories and is a very useful piece, especially for SNOT techniques (and no, I'm not talking about the type of snot that many people usually have stuck in their nose around this time of year)"
p4812
aS' There are some printed parts as well, such as the clock tile, the letter tile, and the register slope like in the first version of the set'
p4813
aS' We also get a new face print for the white cat which is more in line with other modern cat designs'
p4814
aS' But the best part is the shop sign which is printed this time around'
p4815
aS' It features a lovely wood pattern, the words "toy shop", and a toy soldier on both sides of the sign'
p4816
aS" Which is ironic since the shop doesn't seem to sell any toy soldiers like this, but it looks so good on the sign that I won't sue them for false advertising"
p4817
aS" The Minifigs Let's start with the most unique figures in this set, the carolers"
p4818
aS' These two were also the highlight in the first version of the set, but in the original they both had the same head (this one -> ) which featured a very questionable facial expression that could easily be taken out of context'
p4819
aS' In this version, they have unique faces which look much better and help distinguish their gender'
p4820
aS" The male caroler uses Lord Vampyre's torso which looks quite snazzy on him"
p4821
aS' Maybe this is Lord Vampyre before he became a vampire? The female caroler is easily the best minifig in the set, though, because in addition to her exclusive head, she also gets an exclusive torso and skirt print! A huge improvement over the generic unprinted one in the original'
p4822
aS" She also gets the queen hair in dark brown and Aragorn's lined cape instead of two combined regular capes"
p4823
aS' This set truly is the Return of the Queen! The snowman is technically not a minifig, but as you can see here, he is exactly as tall as one and he is the first thing you build after the minifigs, so I included him here'
p4824
aS' He has mostly the same design as before, except this time he has robot claws for arms instead of levers'
p4825
aS' Which is good since they allow him to hold accessories such as his broom'
p4826
aS' His carrot nose is included separately again'
p4827
aS' The carolers both have back printing while the snowman looks no different from the back than he does from the front'
p4828
aS" Here you can see the black side of the female's cape"
p4829
aS' This lined cape is so much nicer than the solution they used in the original'
p4830
aS' Next up we have what I assume is a married couple who are likely the parents of at least one of the kids, as well as the toymaker who I will call Geppetto'
p4831
aS" The man in the pinstripe suit was not included in the first version of the set, so he's a bonus minifig! These guys are fairly generic, but they have some detailed torso prints, so they look pretty nice"
p4832
aS" Geppetto seems to have gotten younger since the release of the original set since his gray hair has now turned dark tan and he doesn't seem to need glasses anymore"
p4833
aS" The men both have back printing, but the woman is the only one in this set who doesn't get a back print"
p4834
aS' Why you gotta be so discriminating against women, LEGO?! Last but not least, there are the kids'
p4835
aS' One of the boys wears dark blue pants, a green jacket, and a wool cap'
p4836
aS" He looks a bit like a lumberjack, so let's call him lumberjack boy, or Jack for short"
p4837
aS" The little girl wears an outfit that wouldn't look out of place in the Friends theme with a lavender scarf and pants"
p4838
aS" I'll call her Lavender"
p4839
aS' The second boy is wearing an Octan jacket and a sports helmet which makes it ironic that he is the one not doing any winter sports on the box art'
p4840
aS" I'll call him President Business Junior, or PBJ for short"
p4841
aS' All of the kids have fairly detailed back printing which makes up for the fact that much like the adults, they are made out of mostly common parts'
p4842
aS" PBJ's helmet and scarf cover up the back of his head nicely which is important as you will see in the next picture"
p4843
aS" What's also great about these figs is that half of them have a double-sided head"
p4844
aS' Here you can see PBJ doing his best Macaulay Culkin impression'
p4845
aS' I also removed his scarf so you can see the printing on his torso better'
p4846
aS" But he's not the only one who seems to be easily scared"
p4847
aS' The mother also has a very alarmed expression'
p4848
aS' Maybe she got surprised by the Jack-in-the-box or maybe she just realized how expensive toys are nowadays'
p4849
aS" You can see the female caroler's back printing here"
p4850
aS' Her alternate expression is a non-singing face which is very nice to have and I wish the male caroler could have one too'
p4851
aS' She looks quite cute with those rosy cheeks'
p4852
aS' But the most adorable out of all of them has to be the little girl'
p4853
aS' She comes with a pouting sad face that will melt your heart'
p4854
aS" Please, don't cry! I'll buy you any toy you want, just stop looking at me like that! The Build The first half of the build is dedicated to the surroundings of the toy shop"
p4855
aS' It includes the Christmas tree, the park bench, the snowman, the toys, the carolers, Jack and Lavender'
p4856
aS" The large bag contains two smaller bags with small pieces, a white box that contains the caroler's cape, and the jester hat in its own little bag"
p4857
aS' The first thing you build after the minifigs and the snowman is the toys'
p4858
aS' This version of the set has a lot more toys than the original which is good because I always felt that the first Toy Shop was a bit light on toys'
p4859
aS' Also, the ones that were in the original have been updated'
p4860
aS' For example, instead of the two pairs of skis, you now get one pair of skis that use the new ski mold and a snowboard'
p4861
aS' The Jack-in-the-box is mostly the same, except it now has an orange and blue color scheme instead of the red and blue from the original'
p4862
aS' This change was probably not necessary, but hey, at least we get a new jester hat out of it'
p4863
aS' And instead of the brick-built teddy bear you get the new teddy bear mold'
p4864
aS" I have mixed feelings about this change because I actually kinda liked the brick-built teddy design and using a specialized mold seems to be going against the spirit of Creator sets, but on the other hand I can't deny that the molded teddy looks better than the blocky old one"
p4865
aS' Meh'
p4866
aS' The new toys include a tugboat which has some rounded Technic pieces as its hull, a biplane, a rocket, a helicopter, and a truck that cleverly uses roller skates for its wheels'
p4867
aS' These are all quite brilliant designs that feel like micro versions of Lego City sets and make a great addition to the set'
p4868
aS' Here is a back view of some of the more complex models'
p4869
aS" As you can see, the Friends accessory stand has been cleverly used to hold the biplane's fin in place and to provide a stand for the helicopter"
p4870
aS' The Jack-in-the-box has a hinged lid'
p4871
aS" The only thing that bugs me a bit is the T-piece on top of the helicopter that holds the rotor in place, but I can't think of any better way they could have done it"
p4872
aS' Next is the ladder that is used to decorate the tree which is exactly the same as the first version'
p4873
aS' The supports are on a click-hinge, so they can be adjusted or folded away'
p4874
aS' Then, you build the tree itself'
p4875
aS' You begins, of course, with the stand which is mostly the same design as before, but this time the plates at the bottom are brown instead of white and have golden studs as feet'
p4876
aS' Next, you build the first layer of branches'
p4877
aS' The main difference in this version of the tree is that this one actually has a brown stem rather than just a Technic axle on which you stack the layers of branches one by one'
p4878
aS' You wont be able to see the stem in the final result, but I like this change as it makes the tree more realistic'
p4879
aS' Then you add the second layer of branches'
p4880
aS" This one doesn't have lights/candles and attaches to the lower layer at an angle using the four trans-yellow studs close to the stem"
p4881
aS' The third layer is added'
p4882
aS' This one has lights again'
p4883
aS' Each layer is similar in that they are all made out of green plates that are built around a 4x4 ring plate, but they get smaller each time and are constructed differently enough for the build not to feel repetitive'
p4884
aS' With the addition of the fourth layer, we get close to finishing the tree'
p4885
aS' Lastly, you add one more layer and the tip of the tree'
p4886
aS" Now it's time to decorate the tree! However, it's not as fun as it sounds since that requires you to add lights to the two chains/ropes first which can get a bit repetitive"
p4887
aS" The clips holding the lights to the chain were white, but this time they're pearl gold which looks much nicer in my opinion"
p4888
aS' The next part of the build is the park bench with the streetlamp and the little tree'
p4889
aS' This is a fairly quick build with not much to it'
p4890
aS" The fishbowl helmet parts are a useful piece that you don't see too often, so it's nice to get them again in this remake"
p4891
aS' The design is pretty much the same as in the original set except for the wreaths on the streetlamp which use a green life preserver instead of a round 2x2 plate'
p4892
aS" This is another instance where they use a specialized piece instead of a brick-built solution, but I'm okay with that because unlike with the teddy bear, this part was not originally intended to be a wreath, so it's still nice part usage"
p4893
aS' The second half of the build is dedicated to the toy shop itself and includes the couple, Geppetto, and PBJ'
p4894
aS' Please note that there is a fourth 6x10 plate burried under the parts'
p4895
aS' You begin by tiling the floor, setting up the walls, and adding the interior items such as the fireplace, the cash register, and the toy displays'
p4896
aS' Next, you add the walls, windows, and the door and the ground floor of the shop is finished'
p4897
aS' So far, the build is the same as the old toy shop, except this time they decided to have the white stripes on the marquees be the longer ones instead of the dark red ones for some reason'
p4898
aS" I don't know why they did this and kinda would have preverred to get dark red 1x1 plates instead of white, but it doesn't detract from the look of the shop, so I don't really care"
p4899
aS' Now we begin with the upper floor'
p4900
aS' This is where things start to look a little different'
p4901
aS' Can you tell the difference? The difference is that this time they attach the roof using clip-hinges instead of bulky Technic constructions which gives you more space on this floor and allows it to look more like an actual attic'
p4902
aS' They even tile the floor next to the frog clock'
p4903
aS' Aftter adding the roof, the build is finished'
p4904
aS" The main roof feels a bit loose since it's only attached to the building by one side"
p4905
aS" I'm not sure if this was an issue in the old toy shop, but it's not a big deal"
p4906
aS" I just wouldn't pick the set up by the roof"
p4907
aS' What I do like is that they used double cheese slopes on the awning on the outer wall of the tower instead of singles which makes it a bit easier to build'
p4908
aS' I like how the supports under the tower roof now match those of the main roof'
p4909
aS' The wreaths have also been updated like the ones on the streetlamp'
p4910
aS' And those Technic arches under the roof look a lot more like garlands now'
p4911
aS" On the original, they were dark gray, so I didn't even know they were supposed to be garlands and assumed they were part of the architecture"
p4912
aS' The shop sign looks a lot better now that it is printed'
p4913
aS' The old one just looked like a white flag'
p4914
aS' I also like how the small plates under the marquee give it a wavy look and they included two trees in different sizes on the right side of the shop'
p4915
aS' The back is nice and open and allows you to see the rest of the toys, the robot, train, and race car, all of which have just as much of a simple and clever design as the other toys'
p4916
aS' The clock looks much nicer with the new golden frog'
p4917
aS' Because golden frogs make everything better'
p4918
aS' Spare Parts There are quite a few small parts left over, including a roller skate and one of those Friends accessory stands which will come in handy'
p4919
aS' The Complete Set Here you can see the full set together'
p4920
aS' It looks quite nice and festive with all the little details and there are many scenes that you can play out with it: You can have the minifigs decorate the tree, have the kids play in the snow, have the carolers sing by the bench, have the toymaker build some toys in his workshop, or have the parents buy presents for their kids'
p4921
aS" It's a festive, toy-filled Winter Wonderland! The fireplace looks cozy and I like the brick pattern going up the chimney"
p4922
aS' The entrance of the shop looks a bit empty aside from the cash register'
p4923
aS' I feel like they could have displayed some more toys here, but oh well'
p4924
aS" Being a set targeted at teens and adults, there aren't really any play features aside from the light brick which is attached to a hinge, so you can either activate it by pressing the button with your finger or tilting the brick upward so that the button is pressed against the roof"
p4925
aS" However, since the roof is not connected in the middle and only attached on the sides, it tends to split open a bit when you do that, so I'm not sure if attaching the roof this way here was such a good idea"
p4926
aS' Nevertheless, it looks quite nice when the light is lit'
p4927
aS' Ratings Design: 5/5 - This set is as gorgeous as it was back in 2009! The small updates that they made are mostly good ones, although the absence of a brick-built teddy is a bit disappointing and the new way the roof is attached, while not as bulky as before, makes the roof slightly unstable, but those are just nitpicks'
p4928
aS' Build: 5/5 - There are some interesting building techniques here, such as those on the tree, the roof, and the toys'
p4929
aS' The fact that the parts are only split into two groups and the part callouts can get fairly complex makes it a challenging, enjoyable build'
p4930
aS' Minifigs: 5/5 - They did a great job updating the figs in this set'
p4931
aS' While only 3 of the torsos in the original had any printing, all of the torsos have printing front and back in this set, even the skirt and cape of the female caroler'
p4932
aS' You get two exclusive heads and half of the heads are double-sided, plus you get 8 instead of 7 minifigs'
p4933
aS" You really can't ask for more in a Creator set"
p4934
aS' Playability: 4/5 - This set is more meant to be displayed than to be played with, but there are plenty of things to play with if you want'
p4935
aS' All the different minifigs, accessories, and set pieces make for endless possibilities for play'
p4936
aS" It's especially fun to swoosh the micro vehicles around"
p4937
aS' Parts: 3/5 - There are lots of good parts here'
p4938
aS' Most of them are fairly common, but there are some rare parts and some even in exclusive colors'
p4939
aS' Price: 4/5 - This set costs $20 more than the original, but considering that this set has nearly 900 pieces, including some rare and exclusive ones, as well as more minifigs with much better printing, I think $80 is still a fair price'
p4940
aS" Overall: 5/5 - So what's my opinion of this set? For a remake, I think it's great"
p4941
aS' They managed to make a good set even better'
p4942
aS' Are the changes minor? Yes'
p4943
aS' Are they an improvement? Mostly, yes'
p4944
aS" Were they necessary? Perhaps not, but it's good that they made them instead of just re-releasing the exact same set"
p4945
aS" So if you didn't get the first Winter Toy Shop, I can highly recommend getting this one"
p4946
aS' If you do already have the old version, this one might still be worth picking up for the hugely improved minifigs and rare parts alone'
p4947
aS' As for the controversy over re-releasing the Winter Toy Shop, I can see where the haters are coming from, but I find their complaints to be quite petty'
p4948
aS" I can understand if you're disappointed because you already have the first Winter Toy Shop and were looking forward to a new set this year, but there's always next year"
p4949
aS" If you're a completist and feel like TLG is forcing you to buy a set you don't need, you're wrong"
p4950
aS' Nobody is forcing you to buy anything but yourself'
p4951
aS" If you decide to buy every set in a theme no matter what it is, that's your problem, not LEGO's"
p4952
aS' So put down your torches and pitchforks and just be glad that they improved the set design and gave us another chance to buy this classic set'
p4953
aS' There are far worse things that can happen in this world than Lego re-releasing one of their most popular sets'

aS' Happy Holidays everyone! Bat-Toys by Okay Yaramanoglu, on Flickr'
p4958
aS'Thanks for a great review first of all'
p4959
aS' I do like the upgrades and changes made from the original 2009 set, more colours and parts are offcourse available today than back in 2009'
p4960
aS' It does look like a great set and i would really realy have loved to get it myself if i had the funds'
p4961
aS' However their are so many other sets thats first priority for me this december and next year, so sadly i might have to pass on this if its not that i can get it redicioulusly cheap at some point'
p4962
aS' And yeah, we should appreciate that LEGO does keep sets coming, even if its just upgrades from earlier releases'
p4963
aS' Town is known for a new police and fire station every year, cant see why a new toyshop is so upsetting'
p4964
aS' Once again thanks for a great review'
p4965
aS' And happy holidays to you as well'
p4966
aS'Nice to see they finally updated that generic screaming face from the 2007 Castle line'

p4971
aS" I don't know what it is with these sets"
p4972
aS' On the one hand they are so nicely designed and cute on the other side I never seriously consider buying one'
p4973
aS" I can't explain what it is that holds me back"
p4974
aS'Great review! I just built the original, and this one has clear advantages over the original (though I wish Lego would stop putting torsos with defined breasts and curves on children)'
p4975
aS' I really like pretty much every change'
p4976
aS" I won't be getting it, and I'd be lying if I said I'm not a little disappointed"
p4977
aS" For the first four years, my mother-in-law got me the new winter village set for Christmas; after the last two, which didn't really fit thematically in my display, I had hoped for a new one--particularly since my daughter is getting to be around the age where she can play with them"
p4978
aS" I mention her specifically because I've seen lots of people dismiss those who are a bit disappointed as rabid adults who don't care about kids getting cool sets, and I don't think that's fair"
p4979
aS' I may have to see how much some of the parts go for on Bricklink'
p4980
aS" The rerelease is better than the original, but not good enough that I'd want to spend $80 to get a set that's nearly identical to one I have"

p4987
aS" A lack of money, maybe? That's the thing that usually holds me back"
p4988
aS' Anyway, I have the older version, so I am not interested in this set'
p4989
aS'Great review, thanks Oky! IMO, the only significant improvements over the 2009 version are the figures, toys, and printed shop sign'
p4990
aS" As I already have the older one I'll have to give this one a pass"
p4991
aS'Regarding the reason for the different designs on the inner bags, I think that the white stripe is the new version, with the non-stripe version being old'
p4992
aS" I suspect the reason some sets have both versions is simply that they're still using up some of their supply of older bags"
p4993
aS' Good review'
p4994
aS" I didn't realise there were quite as many changes as you highlighted (tree, roof etc)"
p4995
aS'Thanks for the excellent review! Unfortunately it only highlights how minimal the upgrades are (though they are nice)'
p4996
aS' Definitively a pass for me'
p4997
aS" Let's hope LEGO does continue to make the more realistic winter village sets (versus Santa)"
p4998
aS" I'm not opposed to a rehash, the post office could use some improvements for example, but this one is just a wee bit minimal"
p4999
aS'I missed out on the first one, but I love the improvements made in this version, like the tree having an actual brown trunk so it looks less like an artificial one, and the carolers as well'
p5000
aS" I may pick this up, but I'm sorry to those of you who already have one"
p5001
aS"I bought it and I'm very happy with it"
p5002
aS'Cheers for putting up the review'
p5003
aS' Some nice improvements, but not enough for me to pick it up'
p5004
aS' The original set is good enough for me'
p5005
aS' Pity the poll has no option "Yes, but only in addition to new sets, not in stead of new sets"'

p5010
aS'Thanks for the review'
p5011
aS" They definitely improved upon the original, but since I already own the original, I can't justify this set also, unfortunately"
p5012
aS' It seems to be the trend'
p5013
aS" But I'm sure there are a lot of first timers out there too that will snatch this up since it is a really lovely building"
p5014
aS' And the updates make it better for sure'
p5015
aS'Thanks Oky for this fine review'
p5016
aS' I agreed with your sentiments on the unnecessary rants'
p5017
aS' I also owned the 2009 version and even though there are minor improvements'
p5018
aS' There must be a logical reason for its release again but is not entirely the same'
p5019
aS' I felt is an excellent opportunity for others to acquire this design especially after six years ago'
p5020

aS' Nobody is forcing you to buy anything but yourself'
p5025
aS" If you decide to buy every set in a theme no matter what it is, that's your problem, not LEGO's"
p5026
aS' So put down your torches and pitchforks and just be glad that they improved the set design and gave us another chance to buy this classic set'
p5027
aS' There are far worse things that can happen in this world than Lego re-releasing one of their most popular sets'
p5028
aS' Sorry for that little rant'
p5029
aS' So what is your opinion on re-releases like this? Please cast your vote in the poll above'
p5030
aS' After mocking people for holding a particular opinion, you then turn around and ask people to express their opinion?? No thanks'
p5031
aS" I guess I'll keep my opinions to myself"
p5032
aS' I certainly don\'t want to be labeled a "hater'
p5033
aS'Thanks for the kind comments everyone! I like hearing your opinions on this set'
p5034
aS' Withacee, on 01 December 2015 - 09:37 AM, said: Pity the poll has no option "Yes, but only in addition to new sets, not in stead of new sets"'
p5035
aS" I don't think that would be a realistic option as that would mean that they would have to spend twice the resources on this theme which I don't think they are ready to do, but if more people would like this option, I can add it to the poll"

p5044
aS" I know, but one can always hope, can't one! I hope the WV theme will be continued in coming years with new sets, but given Santa's workshop and this re-release, I don't get my hopes up too much"
p5045
aS' Time to get MOCing and reverse engineering!'
p5046
aS"I didn't own the original toy shop so I bought it this time around"
p5047
aS' I just finished building it Saturday and I love it! However, I wish they had both re-released this one AND came out with a new addition to the village'

p5054
aS" That's a perjorative term that's loaded with negative connotation, as I'm sure you're well aware"
p5055
aS' It\'s the flipside to me calling you a "mindless fanboy" or a "corporate shill'
p5056
aS'" Those aren\'t terms that invite friendly discussion'
p5057
aS" They shut down discussion by belitting the other person's opinion, and implying that they lack the maturity or intelligence to think critically"
p5058
aS" I don't actually care all that much about this set"
p5059
aS' You just hit on a pet peeve of mine, is all'
p5060

aS'REVIEW - 42044 - DISPLAY TEAM JET INTRODUCTION The smallest of the 2016 sets, is the Display Team Jet'
p5063
aS" It doesn't seem to have lots of functionality, but maybe the landing gear is retractable"
p5064
aS" This set kind of reminds me to the 9394 - Jet Plane, although it's obviously a lot smaller"
p5065
aS" As you can read in my review of the 42052 - Heavy Lift Helicopter basically anything flying is +1 for me, so let's find out if this set also fits the bill"
p5066
aS' Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions'
p5067
aS' SET INFORMATION Number: 42044 Title: Display Team Jet Theme: Technic Released: 2016 Part Count: 113 Box Weight: 193 gr Box Dimensions: 15,4 cm x 13,8 cm x 5,9 cm Set Price (MSRP):  9,99 Price per Part:  0,088 Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX Being a small set, it obviously comes in a small box'
p5068
aS' The Display Team Jet is an Aerobatics Jet, used in air shows'
p5069
aS" On the box it's flying rather high, but at least it's at a safe distance from the crowd"
p5070
aS' Front side shows the main model, together with a small section indicating you can use Digital Building instructions to build this model'
p5071
aS' BACK SIDE The back side shows the B-model, a Stunt Plane'
p5072
aS' And again a reference to the apps for Digital Building instructions'
p5073
aS' More on the Stunt Plane later'
p5074
aS' CONTENT OF THE BOX The box contains: 2 Instructions Booklets (A- and B-model) 1 Sticker Sheet 3 Technic Liftarms 2 Bags INSTRUCTION BOOKLETS Both the instructions for the A- and B-model are included in the box'
p5075
aS' STICKER SHEET A lot of stickers for such a small set'
p5076
aS' Apparently no panel is left untouched'
p5077
aS' LIFTARMS Three liftarms unsealed, nothing out of the ordinary for a small set'
p5078
aS' BAGS Two bags containing the rest of the parts'
p5079
aS' HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This section describes the new and/or otherwise interesting parts'
p5080
aS" YELLOW 5L AXLES The 5L Axle in Yellow has never been released before, so it's one of the new parts for this year"
p5081
aS' BLACK 7L FLEX AXLES For the layman this seems a common part, but the 7L Soft Axle actually has never been released in black before'
p5082
aS' Combined with the re-release of the 19L Soft Axle in black, this will open up lots of possibilities'
p5083
aS" For those of you thinking you've read this text before; you are right, the new Drag Racer contains these new 7L Flex Axles too"
p5084
aS' WHITE PANELS This small set comes with a whopping 10 panels'
p5085
aS' Great for the ones who like panels'
p5086
aS' Not so great if you think TLG is using too much panels lately'
p5087
aS" RUDDER This part, the Small Bionicle Wing, is the same as the one used in last year's 42033 - Record Breaker"
p5088
aS' PART LIST This set contains 113 parts, all listed below'
p5089
aS' THE BUILD This is the collection of parts, used to build the Jet'
p5090
aS' It sure looks like we are getting a landing gear'
p5091
aS' The build is fun, but pretty straightforward'
p5092
aS" There aren't any special or cool techniques used in this set"
p5093
aS' It almost took me more time to apply all the stickers than to build the actual model'
p5094
aS' FINISHED MODEL The finished Jet does look cool though'
p5095
aS' The white and yellow color scheme, combined with the stickers, work really well'
p5096
aS" I have seen people refer to the plane as being orange, but it's definitely yellow"
p5097
aS' Technic (or LEGO in general) tends to have some color variation when it comes to yellow'
p5098
aS" I do concur this is the warmer variant of yellow, but it's not orange"
p5099
aS' The back of the plane looks nice too, although I am not a big fan of the rudder part'
p5100
aS' It looks too detailed, compared to the other panels'
p5101
aS" It's not a big deal though, and maybe it's just me"
p5102
aS' PARTS LEFT Only three common parts left'
p5103
aS' FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS This set has a single feature and that is a retractable landing gear'
p5104
aS" It's operated by the black 12T Double Bevel Gear near the cockpit"
p5105
aS' In the following picture you can see the landing gear retracted'
p5106
aS' This image shows the landing gear when the plane is ready for landing'
p5107
aS" Hopefully the pilot will roll the plane before landing, but you probably know what I mean VIDEO Here's s short video demonstrating the Display Team Jet"
p5108
aS' B-MODEL This set also includes the building instructions for the B-model, a Stunt Plane'
p5109
aS' The building experience for the Stunt Plane is more or less the same as for the Jet'
p5110
aS' Well, what do you expect when both models are planes with a limited number of parts'
p5111
aS' For an alternative model the Stunt Plane looks fine'
p5112
aS" There's not a lot of functionality in this plane, but it's worth mentioning that the tail wheel allows the plane to roll on a flat surface"
p5113
aS' The plane also has working propellors'
p5114
aS' Both functions are demonstrated in the video'
p5115
aS' Unfortunately, the landing gear of the Stunt Plane is not retractable'
p5116
aS" PARTS LEFT A couple of extra leftover parts, but it's nice to see that most of the parts have been used in the B-model as well"
p5117
aS" Actually, there's probably an extra yellow Technic Smooth 1/2 Bush left"
p5118
aS' I just found it on my desk, but it could belong to one of the other sets'
p5119
aS" VIDEO Here's a video demonstrating the Stunt Plane"
p5120
aS" SUMMARY Two nice planes for 13 bucks, that's basically what you get"
p5121
aS' Both models look good and the set has some interesting new parts'
p5122
aS' Especially the 7L Flex Axle will be very popular'
p5123
aS' It comes with a decent collection of white panel, although they are very common nowadays'
p5124
aS' Both models have limited functionality, but each of them has at least one function to give the model some playability for kids, other than the swooshability that is'
p5125
aS' Okay, it might lack some proper functions, but I still think kids will love this set'
p5126
aS' I can see kids running around with one of the planes in their hands'
p5127
aS" All in all I think this set delivers what you'd expect"
p5128
aS" SCORE Let's see how this set flies! Remember that the grades are based on it being a small set"
p5129
aS' Obviously a set like this, cannot be compared with a Mercedes flagship'
p5130
aS' 8 DESIGN For a small set, the model looks very authentic'
p5131
aS' 7 BUILDING EXPERIENCE No surprises'
p5132
aS' 7 FEATURES Just the retractable landing gear'
p5133
aS' 8 PLAYABILITY It has swooshability, so I see kids running around with this model'
p5134
aS' 7 PARTS Lots of panels, if you are into that'
p5135
aS" 8 VALUE FOR MONEY Can't go wrong with these small sets"
p5136
aS' 7,5 FUN FOR KIDS More image can be found on my Flickr page'
p5137
aS' Thank you for reading'
p5138
aS' I hope you enjoyed it'
p5139
aS"While I can see kids enjoying this, I'm not sure I would buy"
p5140
aS' The flex axles are nice, and it is a decent number of white panels but I think I would get better return out of a larger parts set'
p5141
aS' Fantastic review though, and your pictures show off this tiny model better than the box art does'
p5142
aS'Very nice little set, and a lot of those new white small panels'
p5143
aS" It's a need!"
p5144
aS'Thanks for the nice review! The landing mechanism looks quite cute'
p5145
aS" Aren't the yellow axles 5L, not 4L? (Very strange that they would release such a part)"
p5146
aS'It says 5l in the parts list'
p5147
aS'Love this model, awesome swooshability, interesting parts, and a nice little model to put on my desk at work :)'
p5148
aS'For 10 Euros very usefull parts'
p5149
aS' I like it as well as other 2016 sets'
p5150
aS' I like the gear retracting mechanism a lot'
p5151
aS' Very good set for good price'
p5152
aS' Thanx for good review'
p5153
aS' :) Max'
p5154
aS"Hi there, nice model, great review! I almost reverse engineered this model, but used wrong parts for landing wheels, didn't know how to fix the nose proper, and so on"
p5155
aS' So i was very interested in this model and i like playing with it'
p5156
aS' I love the reviews, but i think i have to mention, that the yellow axle must be a 5L! The picture shows a 5L, and a 5L would fit the size of the model'
p5157
aS' The cart has also a 5L in yellow'
p5158
aS' What sitze is the yellow axle in this seit'
p5159
aS' Really 4L as written in the text? Greetings, Robert'

p5166
aS"I seem to have been messing up Axle Lengths in various reviews It's indeed 5L"
p5167
aS' My bad'
p5168
aS' Thanks for pointing it out'
p5169
aS'Very nice review for a nice little set! I especially like the smoothness of operation for the retractable landing gear'
p5170
aS" I don't like the lack of symmetry for the propeller of the B model though, but understand the alternative would be to add one extra small panel to the set, or skip two of them in the B model"
p5171
aS'Good review, as always Jim When I first saw this set I thought that it would make a great parts pack for me, as that I have about 20 white pieces in my Technic collection (all from 42043) and this set has some really useful ones, all for a cheap price'
p5172
aS" Those 7L flex axles will be extremely useful in my current build I'm doing"
p5173
aS'Nice review, even with the missing demonstration video of the A-model! Looks like this is an excellent panel pack for the price, and those soft axles will go down a treat'
p5174
aS' Will this set be the dark horse of 1H 2016'
p5175
aS'I am definitely getting set for the panels!'
p5176
aS'Jay Psi, on 02 December 2015 - 12:10 AM, said: Nice review, even with the missing demonstration video of the A-model! Hmmm strange'
p5177
aS' Let me fix that'
p5178
aS'Fixed the video and fixed the stars in the voting'
p5179
aS' Thanks for paying attention guys'
p5180
aS"Set is only interesting for the panels, that's all it is to me"
p5181
aS'I just built the A model, and I rather like it'
p5182
aS' It is much bigger than it looks from the box - about 30 studs long'
p5183
aS' There is only one function - the landing gear - but it works very nicely'
p5184
aS" Apart from that, it's a very solid build, and achieves an elegant shape with an absolute minimum of parts"
p5185
aS" I don't usually get excited about small sets, but this one appeals to me"
p5186
aS' I like the feeling that every single piece has a purpose'
p5187
aS"My favourite of the 2016 sets I've built so far"
p5188
aS' I\'d go so far as to say this is the best "budget" set in years'
p5189
aS' I would have loved this when I was a kid '
p5190
aS' great "swoosh ability" ??'

p5195
aS'I got this little set for Xmas and I noticed all the gaps and decided to fix them, so here it is'
p5196
aS' IMG_5344 by JJ2Sam, on Flickr First I added some beams to the wings and top to make it less hollow, second I put some navigation lights on it, I made the nose a bit wider and added a control panel, and lastly I changed out the landing gear wheels to more appropriate ones'
p5197
aS' IMG_5349 by JJ2Sam, on Flickr More pictures are HERE'
p5198
aS"Thats a cool little mod, two small nigles though, 1, your navigation lights are flipped on the main wings, 2, the panels on the tail i *think* were supposed to be the intakes for the jet engine, by using them to close up the tail you've turned it into a glider Cant wait untill i find one of these on shelves!"
p5199
aS'So this set showed up in stores yesterday, and i immediately picked two up'
p5200
aS' All in all it is a nice set, but it is slightly different from what i was expecting, the plane feels a bit "flat", pointy nose, wide bottom etc'
p5201
aS' And while the panels work very well as wings, it feels a bit simplistic to just have single-part wings'
p5202
aS' The stickers really work for it though'
p5203
aS' Its a cracking set though, nice parts pack, and a nice model as well'
p5204
aS'Got this at the weekend, mainly for the parts, but built it first'
p5205
aS' Agreed with other comments - awesome swooshability'
p5206
aS'REVIEW - 42046 - GETAWAY RACER INTRODUCTION Starting with the 42010 - Off-road Racer and 42011 - Race Car in 2013, TLG released two sets in the first half of each year, using a pullback motor'
p5207
aS' The pullback motor allows the model to be pulled back, followed by forward motion'
p5208
aS" Usually there's no apparent relation between the two set, other than the ability to combine them into an alternate build"
p5209
aS' This year there seems to some sort of Cops and Robbers scene going on'
p5210
aS' A Getaway Racer and a Police Interceptor'
p5211
aS" That can't be a coincidence"
p5212
aS' Makes you wonder who will be victorious, the good guys or the bad guys'
p5213
aS" Let's find out! Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions"
p5214
aS" SET INFORMATION Number: 42046 Title: Getaway Racer Theme: Technic Released: 2016 Part Count: 170 Box Weight: 302 gr Box Dimensions: 26,0 cm x 13,8 cm x 5,9 cm Set Price (MSRP):  19,99 Price per Part:  0,118 Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX The box has the same dimensions as previous year's pullback motor sets"
p5215
aS" In the lower right corner there's a visual explanation of the pullback mechanism"
p5216
aS" The dark model with it's decals sure looks like a cool hot rod"
p5217
aS' CONTENT OF THE BOX The box contains: 1 Instructions Booklet 1 Sticker Sheet 2 Technic Liftarms 1 Pullback Motor 3 Bags INSTRUCTION BOOKLET Just a single booklet'
p5218
aS' Unfortunately no booklet for the alternate model'
p5219
aS' STICKER SHEET The sticker sheet contains a lot of cool stickers with flames and skulls etc'
p5220
aS' PULLBACK MOTOR AND LIFTARMS The pullback motor and two liftarms are found unbagged'
p5221
aS' BAGS A total of three bags containing the majority of the parts'
p5222
aS' HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This section describes the new and/or otherwise interesting parts'
p5223
aS" Actually, this set is the only set of 1H 2016 which doesn't use any new parts, not even parts in a new color"
p5224
aS' TIRES The Getaway Racer uses four low profile tires (Tire 37 x 22 ZR)'
p5225
aS' RIMS The rims are Wheel 30'
p5226
aS'4mm D'
p5227
aS' x 20mm in Pearl Gold, found in 12 other sets'
p5228
aS' PANELS This set contains three #3 Panelsand three #4 Panels in black'
p5229
aS' PART LIST This set contains 171 parts, all listed below'
p5230
aS" THE BUILD This being a small model, I won't show any building steps"
p5231
aS" Let's skip right to the finished model"
p5232
aS' Below you can see the end result'
p5233
aS' In my opinion the model looks great'
p5234
aS" It's got that hot rod vibe going on and the stickers add darkness to the vibe"
p5235
aS' Slight problem with this set is that it really needs the stickers to finish the look'
p5236
aS" Otherwise it's quite dull, with black and dark grey liftarms and panels"
p5237
aS' The rear view shows the pullback motor connected directly to the rear axle'
p5238
aS' In this image you can also clearly see the exhaust pipes on the side, which are very well executed'
p5239
aS' The 3x3 Technic Discs with stickers, used in the rim, result in only seeing a part of the rim'
p5240
aS' This works very well with the golden rims'
p5241
aS' The bottom view shows the chassis of the car'
p5242
aS' Nothing really noteworthy, as you would expect from a pullback set'
p5243
aS' VIDEO The following video gives you an overview of the finished model'
p5244
aS' PARTS LEFT These six parts are left after building the model'
p5245
aS' Seems about right'
p5246
aS' FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS This being a pullback motor set, it only has a single feature'
p5247
aS' The video below demonstrates the acceleration of the vehicle'
p5248
aS' My girlfriend was kind enough to catch the model before it fell to the ground'
p5249
aS' Or did it hit something before it fell to the ground?! VIDEO This video shows the pullback functionality'
p5250
aS' B-MODEL The alternate model is a combined build with the Police Interceptor, which you can see on the back of the box'
p5251
aS" Unfortunately the instructions for the combined B-model are not included, so I didn't get a chance to build it"
p5252
aS' This would make for a fun challenge, building the B-model without the instructions'
p5253
aS" SUMMARY Pullback sets are not the most technically advanced models, so you can't expect any other functionality than hitting the walls in your house"
p5254
aS' However, I think they are very appealing to kids'
p5255
aS" The fact that this year's pullback sets form a duo adds to the fun"
p5256
aS' In my opinion TLG hit the nail on the head with the Getaway Racer and Police Interceptor'
p5257
aS" The Getaway Racer looks very badass, which is something you don't see every day in a Technic set"
p5258
aS" SCORE How do I grade the bad guy in this year's duo"
p5259
aS' 8 DESIGN It looks so cool, but it does need the stickers'
p5260
aS' 7 BUILDING EXPERIENCE Nothing out of the ordinary'
p5261
aS' 7 FEATURES Limited to the pullback-and-drive functionality'
p5262
aS' 7 PLAYABILITY Combined with the Police Interceptor, kids will love it'
p5263
aS" It does need it's Nemesys though"
p5264
aS' 7 PARTS Collection of common parts'
p5265
aS' Gold rims could be interesting'
p5266
aS' 8 VALUE FOR MONEY Pullback sets always deliver a certain value'
p5267
aS' 7,3 HIT IT! More image can be found on my Flickr page'
p5268
aS' Thank you for reading'
p5269
aS' I hope you enjoyed it'
p5270
aS'I almost purchased this today because I like the wheel / disc combo so much'
p5271
aS'Another great review Jim! And again i love the model, those pearl gold wheels This one definitely goes on the "buy on sight" list'
p5272
aS'One hero will now have just enough of that pullback motor to create one ultimate machine, thanks to this'
p5273
aS'Jim great reviews but can I suggest you one thing? Take some pics before you apply the stickers'
p5274

aS"Lego 42049 Mine Loader Thanks to Lego and EuroBricks for making this review possible! This was supposed to be a preview-review, before the Dec 1 release date for the set, but it got stuck in customs or something and didn't arrive in time"
p5321
aS" Well, I'd rather do a good, late review than a rushed review, so here it is"
p5322
aS' Name: Mine Loader Set Number: 42049 Pieces: 476 (I think) Price: $39'
p5323
aS"99 (I think) Minifigs: 0 Theme: Technic Year of Release: 2016 Links: Bricklink Brickset The Box Another standard Technic box, not that there's anything wrong with that"
p5324
aS' It is a littler weird that the mine loader is shown OUTSIDE the mine, but whatever'
p5325
aS' The Back of the Box Again, very standard'
p5326
aS" It's oddly technical, showing the exact angle of the machine when turning, but that's the sort of nerdy detail that Technic people like"
p5327
aS' The alternate Mine Cutting Machine model looks interesting and unusual as well'
p5328
aS' The 1:1 Part The 1:1 part on the top of the box is especially helpful with this set'
p5329
aS" These mining machines are very oddly proportioned, since they need to fit in mine tunnels, so it's hard to judge the model size based on the wheels or seat like you can an ordinary set"
p5330
aS' The Contents You get manuals for both models (a single book for the B and two books for the main), a medium size sticker sheet, 4 bags, and 4 loose tires'
p5331
aS' The Special Parts This set has 4 of the new mudguard panels in yellow, two cylinder halves in red (a new color), some of the new color red and yellow axles, a couple of the new-ish Technic spacers, some of the axle-pin combination pieces, and a couple swords! I\'m pretty sure that\'s "an antenna" and a spare'
p5332
aS" The Start of the B-Model Since I like the main model better, I'm building the alternate first, so that's how I'll write the review"
p5333
aS' There\'s "power" for something (probably the engine) being taken off the one axle here'
p5334
aS' Overall, a pretty standard Technic frame beginning with some structural beams, a frame, and using liftarms to support axles out to the sides'
p5335
aS" More of the Frame The far end of the model has some obvious steering mechanism being formed, as well as a pivoting arm right in the center that's probably the connection from the Hand of God knob"
p5336
aS' The Steering Yup'
p5337
aS' Called it'
p5338
aS' Oddly, there is a different turning radius between right and left right now'
p5339
aS" I wonder if that'll get fixed"
p5340
aS" More Mechanisms That's looking more Technic now"
p5341
aS' Sad to see a u-joint being used just as a fixed straight connection like that, but it is the alternate model'
p5342
aS" The Engine Block Because all engines should be enclosed in a red cylindrical housing, am I right? The Chassis It's definitely coming together now"
p5343
aS' And yes, the B-model instructions tell you to put the stickers on'
p5344
aS" It doesn't matter whether you build the main or alternate first, you'll get the stickers on (almost - there were a couple leftover that didn't get used in the B-model)"
p5345
aS' Almost Done With the rest of the body done and the wheels on, you really get the scale of this machine'
p5346
aS' That blue seat is tiny compared to the rest of it! And yes, the uneven steering lock got fixed'
p5347
aS' After putting the wheels on, you add a couple of "pin with ball" pieces to the underside to restrict the steering'
p5348
aS" They didn't do that at first so that you could turn the axles sharper while putting the wheels on, which made it easier to do"
p5349
aS' The Grinder Keeping in mind the scale of the machine, this thing looks terrifying! The tan gear at the back drives the spinning blade up front'
p5350
aS' The red bushes near the turntable let you adjust the angle'
p5351
aS" All Done The arm quickly attaches to the body and it's done"
p5352
aS" Sadly, that tan gear doesn't connect to anything - it's just a knob so you can spin the blade by hand"
p5353
aS" Raise Your Hand, If You're Sure"
p5354
aS" (I think I'm dating myself with that title"
p5355
aS') This thing has massive reach'
p5356
aS" I'm imagining this inside a mine, grinding away the rock overhead"
p5357
aS' Pretty viciously effective machine! The crank on this side of the model is used to raise and lower the arm'
p5358
aS' Works well, and the grey spacer makes it nice to use since it spins freely'
p5359
aS' The Leftovers Not much left for a B-model'
p5360
aS' Nice usage! Starting the Main Model The main model starts similarly to the alternate, with a frame, some axles, and a drive connection from one axle to something later'
p5361
aS" Getting Complicated Already We're only a few pieces in and we already have three separate gear trains going on"
p5362
aS" There's the axle driving the tan beveled gears inside the frame at the bottom"
p5363
aS" There's more tan gears in the middle, and there's also a black gear sticking up as a knob that turns the grey connector in the center"
p5364
aS' The Body is Done I skipped ahead quite a bit, but it was a bunch of standard Technic building'
p5365
aS" You've got a fake engine with fan at the back, driven by one of the rear wheels, a knob sticking up for steering, and an axle coming forward to open and close the claw"
p5366
aS' The Claw! I like that they used a link system to open and close the claw instead of just gearing it'
p5367
aS" The axle comes forward from the chassis (it's the red axle) with a couple u-joints for flexibility and drives a worm gear"
p5368
aS' That rotates a gear below with a 2 stud liftarm on each side'
p5369
aS' Those arms have pin with towball in them and then a link going from that short liftarm to the claw'
p5370
aS" It's a small rotation of the liftarm, but makes the claw open widely and works very well"
p5371
aS' Raising the Claw A few black liftarms join the claw to the body of the loader and allow it to move up and down'
p5372
aS" It's a simple mechanism there - one yellow beam goes back and connects to a lever that lets you raise and lower the claw"
p5373
aS' When raised (as shown), the lever locks in place by going just slightly past the centerline'
p5374
aS" And It's Done Add some wheels, a cab, and some wheel arches and we're done"
p5375
aS" It's a great looking machine, pretty unique, and looks like the real thing"
p5376
aS' The main difference from reality is these usually have a scoop for moving loose rock'
p5377
aS" Since we've had so many scooping vehicles in the past (tracked loaders, the Volvo L350F, excavators, etc) the claw here is a fun change and adds to the playability for kids"
p5378
aS' Like the real thing, the body stays very low so the cab only has to stick up a little bit for the driver to see all around, because mines are cramped and busy areas'
p5379
aS' From the Rear This angle is great'
p5380
aS' I love the use of the new mudguard panels to make a nice curve to the back of the loader'
p5381
aS' The antenna is a little weird, but perhaps they had a big pile of flat silver fencing swords to use up'
p5382
aS' The black gear just to the left of the antenna is the claw control'
p5383
aS' Rotating that gear opens and closes it'
p5384
aS' The back end is a little lighter than a real machine would be, but Lego wanted to leave the engine exposed so you can see the cylinders moving'
p5385
aS" The Conclusion So, what's my conclusion on this model? I like it a lot"
p5386
aS" It's simpler than a big set would be, but it's got lots of design and playability crammed in a mid-sized set"
p5387
aS" It's a unique vehicle"
p5388
aS' However, it does have a few flaws'
p5389
aS' The steering on the main model needs some drag added'
p5390
aS" As is, you basically have to drive by holding the steering knob since it'll bend if you push it from behind"
p5391
aS" I don't like the use of pin with pin hole as mounting points for the orange and red trans plates for lights, since they can turn slightly and be at weird angles"
p5392
aS' The antenna is unnecessary and in the way'
p5393
aS' But none of these flaws are dealbreakers or even big deals'
p5394
aS" They're minor"
p5395
aS' The Ratings Value: 10/10 - Less than 10 cents a piece, lots of useful liftarms and such, nothing too weird or single-use'
p5396
aS" Design: 9/10 - Looks very realistic for the size of the set, good functionality, not too dependent on stickers Minifigs: n/a - n/a Playability: 9/10 - Controls aren't perfect (loose steering, small knob for claw control) but very functional and cleverly done"
p5397
aS' Parts: 9/10 - Nice selection, although heavy on the standard yellow and black'
p5398
aS' Almost zero studded parts'
p5399
aS' Overall: 9'
p5400
aS"5/10 - It's a great intro to Technic set - a unique vehicle, good functionality, nice part selection, and decently priced"
p5401
aS' I like it a lot and plan to keep it around as a finished set'
p5402
aS"Great review with high quality pictures, well done!! I'm glad you took the time to do it properly"
p5403
aS' Cool that you have built both models'
p5404
aS' I agree with the mudguards'
p5405
aS' They sure look good on this model'
p5406
aS'I was waiting especially for review of this set'
p5407
aS' Let me add few things about this'
p5408
aS' thing'
p5409
aS' It all will be complainging of person who works with these type of machines, so if you just want a unusual machine in your collection, ignore my complaining :) I see underground loaders almost every day, and believe me, this model would now work in the underground mine'
p5410
aS' First of all, its cab should stick out more from the frame'
p5411
aS' Each loader has cab placed out of the chassis, to provide better view for the driver'
p5412
aS' In this class of machine it would help a bit, but in low loader ones it is extremely important: This is the view from the cab of a low profile loader (looking at front - and yes, front of the machine is where engine is placed, because at least at KGHM all machines drive engine forward): Another thing about that cab is that seat and steering wheel/joysticks are placed perpendicularly to the machine chassis, to provide same view for driving forward and backwards'
p5413
aS' So another weak spot of the set'
p5414
aS' The model lacks of trans clear lights on the engine part, because all machines that work underground have same lamps on front and back'
p5415
aS' Another thing that comes to my mind is that warning light and antena would not live too long in the mine, becuase it could be torn apart by ramming into tunnels roofs'
p5416
aS' It does resemble shape of underground machine, but not a loader'
p5417
aS' Only machine that comes to my mind is something that are used for moving/placing hydraulic support jacks in tunnels'
p5418
aS" Sorry for poor quality, I didn't find better picture of it: It does have claw, four wheels and articulated chassis, but have much greater range of movement of the arm"
p5419
aS" Anyway, I'd give it at least 3/5 for overall look"
p5420
aS' Model itself, as a set, looks unfinished (or cut down on pieces after visit of an accountant'
p5421
aS') For me it looks like engine part was built differently, with knobs for steering/claw operating sticking out from back'
p5422
aS' Claw needs almost seven full turns of the worm gear to close from opened position, and is rather annoing to use it in way it is built in this model'
p5423
aS' Bracket that holds bevel gears responsible for steering is rather loose, being hold in place by single 3/4 pin'
p5424
aS' On the other hand, the steering works very well'
p5425
aS' It seems that lack of differential will be more common in LEGO sets, becuase it is another model that have fake engine driven by single wheel (like in old russian RC cars'
p5426
aS' I am OK with that, but it is a pitty that this model has only R2 engine'
p5427
aS' Thing that I do not like the most in this model is how the claw arm works'
p5428
aS' First of all, it barelly lifts the claw of the ground, the movement could be much better'
p5429
aS' And it has major design flaw - universal joints are not placed in line with articulation points, and this is main reason of 5L axle not being suported on both sides under the turntable'
p5430
aS' While rainsing the arm, it bends a little! I really would like to see this model built differently, with normal bucket and better range of movement'
p5431
aS' Edited by M_longer, 05 December 2015 - 11:08 PM'
p5432
aS"Thanks for the thorough comments! I agree that the set has some limitations, both in construction and realism, but I think they're acceptable given the pricepoint and size"
p5433
aS' The antenna is definitely ludicrous - I really do suspect they had a surplus of the swords to use up! And yes, the way the steering knob is mounted is loose'
p5434
aS" I also noticed that the u-joints to the claw are not in the right spot like you mentioned, but didn't include it since it still works fine"
p5435
aS' That axle coming forward to the claw has a very long unsupported section that does bend a bit when you raise and lower the claw'
p5436
aS" It works, but is a bit of a cheat that I'm kinda surprised they let through"
p5437
aS' I just checked and the bucket from 8043 is a couple studs too wide for this set'
p5438
aS" I'm betting that was seriously considered, but it'd have meant scaling the whole thing up and that would have put it into a higher price point"
p5439
aS' Or they could have pulled the mold for the 8x14 bucket back out and remade it for this set'
p5440
aS" I really like the model you built! And that's interesting about the cabs being basically flush with the top but sticking out the side"
p5441
aS' In image searching as part of my research, I found both that style and ones like this, with the cab sticking up more (like the photo of the Caterpillar one in my review)'
p5442
aS" I wonder if that's a US/European difference, or different types of mining, or what, because both styles definitely exist in the real world"
p5443
aS'Excellent review! Worth waiting for'
p5444
aS' The set itself is very interesting'
p5445
aS' looks like it may have one interesting build techniques'
p5446
aS' Thanks for the review, Andy Ad'

aS'Great review, thank you'

aS' The set to me is kinda blah, interested more in the new panels than the rest of it'

aS"Think this is the only 1H set I'll be getting"
p5450
aS" Guess I'm waiting for 2H for the rest of the construction stuff! This set looks okay to me; it includes the instructions for both models, which is cool, and includes some great parts"
p5451
aS" I like that it's not just another bucket loader and that it actually tries something different, too"
p5452
aS'Great review and great pictures ! Many thanks for talking the time to review this set '

p5459
aS' its so simple, a set close to 500 pieces with only 1 real function, and the entire rear section looks unfinished'
p5460
aS'Great review! One thing reaaaaaally bothers me about this set, both models have the engine connected to one wheel, the other wheel on the "powered" axle is just left to rotate freely, and that really bothers me, as it did in 42022 (on 42022 even more TBH, since its main feature is being a frigging car)'
p5461
aS' Looking at the pics it isnt even a space issue (as it was in the hot rod, where they "needed" to route the steering through), so they just cheaped out and didnt bother fitting a diff in there (or even a live axle link) Im not very interested in this set (not into construction stuff), but i think this is a worrying trend :('
p5462

aS' Some Weirdness This felt very weird to me - making the crankshaft for the engine, they have you build it right to left'
p5516
aS" I don't know if it's because I'm a lefty or what, but it felt awkward"
p5517
aS" I need to look in some old manuals and see if it's always been this way"
p5518
aS" (nope! I randomly looked at 2013's set 42000 Racer, and it builds it left to right"
p5519
aS") Assembling the Core Here's the core of the racer, upside down"
p5520
aS' The engine block, some gears at each end, and a couple boat studs for smooth gliding'
p5521
aS' And yes, they cheated and those are only attached on two studs instead of all 4'
p5522
aS" I'm always amazed at how Lego geometry keeps finding interesting ways that it works"
p5523
aS' Like here, with those boat studs'
p5524
aS' They fit perfectly into the bottom of the brick and against the beam'
p5525
aS' The Front End Up front we get a standard blue seat with a couple "hidden" wheels behind it'
p5526
aS" A boat doesn't typically have wheels, but these will drive the mechanisms of this model, so we'll let it slide"
p5527
aS' An odd part choice here though - in the very front there are two tan "axle pin without friction" parts holding that 3 long liftarm on'
p5528
aS" Why? There's no need in either model for the non-friction pin, and there's lots of the normal blue axle pins in the set"
p5529
aS" So why include these two different pins? And All Done! It looks like a huge jump here, but it's really not"
p5530
aS' The front and rear connect to each other, and then a bunch of big panels are added that make the model look WAY bigger'
p5531
aS' The stickers on this set really make it work'
p5532
aS" Without them it's pretty bland and boring, so I recommend using them"
p5533
aS' From the Rear At the back we have a fan to propel the boat'
p5534
aS" That's not so accurate"
p5535
aS' All the images I can find of real-life boats use props in the water'
p5536
aS' But since this is a non-floating model, we have to make some tweaks I guess'
p5537
aS' There also should be fins going down into the water for stability and hydroplaning, but again, had to drop that'
p5538
aS" Here's an example of a real boat: You can see they nailed the overall look quite well"
p5539
aS" The Underside For those that want to see the mechanicals, here's the underside of the model"
p5540
aS' Minifig Scale Technic? Nope, not quite'
p5541
aS" A fig will fit the seat, but sticks out of the cockpit and can't fit a helmet at all"
p5542
aS' So close'
p5543
aS' Starting the B Model Again with the engine block, but this time an opposing 4 instead of inline'
p5544
aS" An Odd Part It's rare for Lego to include parts specific to the B-model, so I was curious when I found this 2-axle with pin, a fairly new part"
p5545
aS" In the main model, it's used in a place that a normal 3 pin would have been fine, and it's the only one of these in the whole set, so it obviously must be needed in the B-model"
p5546
aS" Sure enough, there's an assembly here that needs it: The Front of the Boat More upside-down building"
p5547
aS' And that silver piston is basically only there as a spacer'
p5548
aS' It has no real function'
p5549
aS' (Yet'
p5550
aS" it turns out later an axle goes into it, so it's a support for one end of the axle"
p5551
aS') Adding the Wheels We keep building around the engine'
p5552
aS' This model uses the same wheel setup as the main model'
p5553
aS" Taking Shape The B-model instructions tell you to put the stickers on in case you haven't - they actually did a good job making the sticker work on either model"
p5554
aS' But the silver piston used as a cross-brace is a bit weird'
p5555
aS' It can spin, so that axle hole on the side ends up facing whatever way it wants'
p5556
aS' The Back End The flex axles are used here under the panels just for appearance and to support the exhausts at the right angle'
p5557
aS' Same fan propulsion as the main model, and just as wrong here :) Worse, the gearing is switched'
p5558
aS' In the main model, the pistons and fan spin pretty quickly as you push the boat across the floor'
p5559
aS' In this one, they turn very slowly'
p5560
aS" More Instruction Weirdness I'm always curious at how Lego decides to do instructions"
p5561
aS" Here's how the panels on one side of the boat are assembled"
p5562
aS' For the mirror image on the other side, they tell you to put all 3 pins into the short panel as step 1 (2 black and a blue), add the white piece as step 2, and then add teh second panel and stickers as step 3'
p5563
aS" Why two different ways? All Done Here's a similar angle as most of the official images"
p5564
aS' Looks ok'
p5565
aS' I noticed though how obvious the wheels are'
p5566
aS' The back of the box image is a lower angle that hides them more'
p5567
aS' And I like the mudguard panels as seats'
p5568
aS' Pretty clever'
p5569
aS" From the Side I'm not fond of the profile"
p5570
aS" It doesn't sit level like I think it should"
p5571
aS' The wheels are a stud too low sticking out of the bottom'
p5572
aS' The Underside Like most B-models, there are compromises'
p5573
aS" There's pins and axles sticking out, but that's what you do when faced with a limited piece selection"
p5574
aS' Minifig Scale Yet? Nope, not quite'
p5575
aS' A bit too big this time'
p5576
aS' I think the driver is supposed to sit in the seat with knees over the front of the guard (where the grey pin is)'
p5577
aS' So the minifig is way too small'
p5578
aS' Spare Pieces Very few leftovers in this B-model'
p5579
aS" The Conclusion So, what's my conclusion on this model? The B-model is fairly meh, and too similar to the main model"
p5580
aS' However, I LOVE the hydroplane racer itself'
p5581
aS' It looks great and is very swooshable'
p5582
aS" For the price, it's surprisingly large thanks to the big panels on the sides, Yes, this is one set that really needs the stickers to look good, but they look great and are well worth putting on"
p5583
aS' The Ratings Value: 9/10 - Close to 10 cents a piece, and a fairly large model for the price'
p5584
aS' Design: 9/10 - Looks great other than the tiny fan on the back'
p5585
aS" Minifigs: n/a - I was tempted to give a score since a minifig almost fits, but that'd be cheating"
p5586
aS' Playability: 8/10 - Not much functionality other than the engine and fan spinning, but very swooshable and sturdy enough to be played with'
p5587
aS' Parts: 9/10 - A bunch of panels (including some new ones), just about every kind of Technic pin, and quite a few thin liftarms '
p5588
aS' Overall: 9/10 - The set is a solid winner, as long as your satisfied with the main model'
p5589
aS'Again, great review with superb pictures'
p5590
aS' The white and blue certainly works very well with your dark backdrop'
p5591
aS' Thorough review for such a small model'
p5592
aS' Small in size but great as a set'
p5593
aS' Tell me, why did I let you review this one?!'
p5594
aS'Quote And the dumbing-down continues'
p5595
aS' Now they have to show people to compare axle lengths to the 1:1 prints on the page that have always been there'
p5596
aS' But how does the 1:1 work on the app? Might have to look into that'
p5597
aS' (for the record'
p5598
aS' I pulled out my phone and tried to find the app in the Google store'
p5599
aS" Couldn't find it"
p5600
aS' So then I went to the Lego website shown on the page and it had a link to it'
p5601
aS" Turns out it wasn't showing up because it's tablet only, so Google wasn't showing it to me on my phone"
p5602
aS" I'll try again later with a tablet"
p5603
aS') Funny thing is that they changed colour of 7L axle to yellow, and on that picture it still is in LBG'
p5604
aS'Thanks for a great review! Too bad there is only one blue curved panel in this set'
p5605
aS' My opinion on the frictionless axlepins is that the flex axle might be easier to stick in them than in regular/blue axlepins'
p5606
aS" Didn't actually try it though :-) Edited by MajklSpajkl, 05 December 2015 - 11:46 PM"
p5607
aS'Excellent review! I am glad that you did not rush this or the Mine Loader review'
p5608
aS' Could it be that the fan in the back is like a turbo prop propulsion'
p5609
aS' Just reaching here'
p5610
aS' Andy D'
p5611
aS'Thank you for the review'
p5612
aS' I have this one in my pile to build'
p5613
aS' I wish there was more of the curved blue panels though'
p5614
aS'here is a video review via JANG to add to the review: i like both A and B so will buy both'
p5615
aS'MajklSpajkl, on 05 December 2015 - 11:45 PM, said: My opinion on the frictionless axlepins is that the flex axle might be easier to stick in them than in regular/blue axlepins'
p5616
aS" Didn't actually try it though :-) Frictionless pins have accurate round hole, while blue friction pins have something squarish"
p5617
aS" Flex axle will fit in both, but using tan pins doesn't require strength"
p5618
aS' Conncetion with tan pins is weaker too'
p5619
aS'Great review! Im a bit undecided on the set though, it has some nice parts (4 cil engine in such a small set!) and it looks good, but also a bit small and simple, not sure if it stands up to the standards of the small tracked loader or similar for sets of this size, and as a parts pack (for panels/flaxles) the display team jet is infinitely better'
p5620
aS' Ill probably pick one up, but right now i really want another tracked loader'
p5621
aS' (last one was sacrificed to the MOD gods)'
p5622
aS'Nice review, thanks Nice little set, I might buy me one'
p5623
aS"REVIEW - 42038 - ARCTIC TRUCK INTRODUCTION Arctic vehicles aren't new to LEGO"
p5624
aS' Back in 2000 the Town theme already had several small orange arctic vehicles'
p5625
aS' In 2014 TLG again released a number of Arctic sets in the City theme (formerly known as Town)'
p5626
aS' Some of these sets are actually pretty big, containing over 700 parts'
p5627
aS' Looking back in history it seems that Arctic sets may have found their origin in the Technic theme'
p5628
aS' Although these sets were white instead of orange, they are unmistakenly Arctic'
p5629
aS' The 1986 Technic Arctic Sets contained the infamous Technic Figures'
p5630
aS" Unfortunately the 2015 Arctic Truck doesn't contain any Technic Figures, but nonetheless it's great to see a new Arctic vehicle in the Technic line, not counting several snow scooters"
p5631
aS" Let's see if the new Arctic Truck lives up to the expectations"
p5632
aS' Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions'
p5633
aS' SET INFORMATION Number: 42038 Title: Arctic Truck Theme: Technic Released: 2015 Part Count: 1219 Box Weight: 2110 gr Box Dimensions: 47,8 cm x 28,0 cm x 7,2 cm Set Price (MSRP):  79,99 / US$ 84'

p5637
aS'066 Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX The box measures 47,8 cm x 28,0 cm x 7,2 cm and weighs around 1385 grams'
p5638
aS" The box actually feels pretty heavy which means it's filled properly"
p5639
aS' This seems to be a trend in the Technic theme'
p5640
aS' Slightly smaller boxes can save shelf space for retailers'
p5641
aS" THE FRONT The front of the box shows the main model and in the lower right corner there's a image with the dimension of the model"
p5642
aS" It's 40cm long and 18cm wide"
p5643
aS' THE BACK The upper part of the back of the box shows the functions of the main model'
p5644
aS' The lower left section shows the B-model, which looks very promising (more on that later)'
p5645
aS' The lower right section shows the motorization options for the main model'
p5646
aS' The crane (partially) and the bed can be motorized'
p5647
aS' Besides motorization some LEDs can be added as headlights'
p5648
aS' THE SIDE On of the sides shows one of the newer smaller style panels'
p5649
aS' This is the first time it appears in orange'
p5650
aS" When you take a look at the sticker you can see that it's not symmetrical"
p5651
aS' Not sure why TLG "cut of" one of the sides of the stickers, since the position of the panel is very suitable for a continuous sticker'
p5652
aS' CONTENT OF THE BOX The box is pretty densely packed, which is better than semi-filled boxes'
p5653
aS' It feels like you actually bought something which matches the box size'
p5654
aS" The box contains: 2 Booklets 1 Sticker Sheet 8 Bags BOOKLETS & STICKER SHEET Unfortunately the instructions and sticker sheet haven't been packed with cardboard protection, which results in a curved sticker sheet and slightly bent instructions"
p5655
aS" In my case this wasn't so bad"
p5656
aS' At least no real damage'
p5657
aS' HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This set proves to be a great parts pack, especially when you might have missed some of the 2014 sets'
p5658
aS" BLACK LINK TREADS Usually the Link Treads come in Dark Blue Grey, but this sets includes 96 Black treads, which is great if you'd like to replace the DBG ones in your MOCs, or other official sets"
p5659
aS' UNDERCARRIAGE AND SUSPENSION Several parts are included to build the undercarriage driving the treads'
p5660
aS' Four Large Tread Sprockets and eight Small Tread Sprockets, which are used as return sprockets'
p5661
aS' Also included are four Steering Portal Hubs and four Steering Portal Axles for driving and steering the vehicle'
p5662
aS' Several frames, including two C-shaped Pivot Frames and two Steering Ball Joints to create an undercarriage much like the 4x4 Crawler'
p5663
aS' The set even includes two H-shaped Frames (a'
p5664
aS'k'
p5665
aS'a'
p5666
aS' Dog Bone Frames)'
p5667
aS' NEW CHANGEOVER CATCH PARTS This year (2015) three new parts have been introduced to improve the changeover catch'
p5668
aS' More on these parts later'
p5669
aS' NEW PIN CONNECTOR Another new part for this year (2015) is the "1L Round Pin Connector", which looks like a pin connector, but acts more like a bush'
p5670
aS' NEW PINS Furthermore this sets includes quite a large number of three (relatively) new parts'
p5671
aS' 17 x Pin with Pin Hole, 14 x 3L Pin with 1L Axle and 11 x 3L Pin with 2L Axle, which have been introduced this year (2015)'
p5672
aS' When the new 3L Pin with 1L Axle was introduced in 2014 it was only a matter of time before the new 3L Pin with 2L Axle would appear'
p5673
aS' Both new Pins are a great addition to the parts portfolio'
p5674
aS" PANELS Last but not least this sets contains a fair number of orange panels, including the 3x11 Panel in Orange, which is the first time we've seen this part"
p5675
aS' PART LIST Below is the entire part list for the 913 parts'
p5676
aS' As usual this part list can be found at the end of the second booklet'
p5677
aS' THE BUILD The build immediately starts with some of the new parts, used to build the compact gearbox in the center of the model'
p5678
aS' Notice the two 20 Tooth Bevel Gears'
p5679
aS' One would have been enough to drive the 12 Tooth Bevel Gear, so the second seems to be useless'
p5680
aS' TLG probably used it in the A-model, because they needed it in the B-model, which you can see later'
p5681
aS' The front and rear suspension are almost identical'
p5682
aS' The front side also has the 13L Gear Rack, used for steering'
p5683
aS' The picture below shows the steering rack on the front suspension in more detail'
p5684
aS' At this point you have more or less finished the chassis'
p5685
aS' The gearbox is in place and the majority of the functions has internally been connected to the right gears'
p5686
aS' The small turntable shows where the crane will be attached later on'
p5687
aS' At the end of the first booklet, some of the bodywork has been attached to the chassis'
p5688
aS' The orange-black color scheme never fails to please me'
p5689
aS' Throw in some cool stickers for the extra effect and we have a winner'
p5690
aS' If you decide to motorize the model, using PF, the top of the cabin can be lifted to accomodate the battery box'
p5691
aS" The chassis uses lots of orange (and some black) panels to give the model it's distinctive look"
p5692
aS' The protective black bumber/railing is a nice addition which adds something to the exterior'
p5693
aS" The dumping bed at the rear can tilt to empty it's load"
p5694
aS" It's operated by a Mini LA"
p5695
aS' The Treads, which look very cool in Black, are driven by a Large Tread Sprocket and returned by two Small Tread Sprockets'
p5696
aS' The front and rear sections are identical'
p5697
aS' Building the undercarriages feels a bit repetitive, which is a problem for most tracked vehicles'
p5698
aS' FINISHED MODEL Adding the crane to the model finishes the build'
p5699
aS' Your model should look something like this'
p5700
aS' When you take a close look at the finished model, you realize this is something else'
p5701
aS" It's trully a unique vehicle"
p5702
aS" The color scheme is brilliant and the fact that it's an Arctic Truck is really neat"
p5703
aS" It's a welcome change for the Technic line to see a vehicle like this"
p5704
aS" This picture emphasizes that's it's a very cool vehicle"
p5705
aS" Imagine this beast plowing through the snow! As far as I know it's not based on a real life vehicle"
p5706
aS" If's probably a combination of several vehicles and some imagination"
p5707
aS' I can be totally wrong though'
p5708
aS' The rear of the vehicle shows the crane and drum, placed on the tipper bed'
p5709
aS' From this angle you can see some of the internals of the model, the gearbox behind the cabin for example'
p5710
aS' The crane can be partially motorized (rotation and base), while the boom is operated manually'
p5711
aS' What I like a lot is the protective railing around the vehicle'
p5712
aS' LEFT OVER PARTS Some leftover parts, nothing noteworthy'
p5713
aS" FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS This set has several functions/features: Steering Driving Suspension Crane Tipping bed STEERING As you can see in the image below the steering mechanism has quite a bit of negative caster (please correct me if I'm wrong), which causes the treads to rotate a bit upward/downward instead of only to the left and right"
p5714
aS' DRIVING You mention driving as a feature?! Yes I do and let me explain why'
p5715
aS' Normally I would ommit this as a feature and take driving for granted'
p5716
aS' However, driving this vehicle (on a flat surface) causes it to simply slide over the surface'
p5717
aS' For other arctic vehicles this would be a plus, but with a tracked vehicle it limits playability'
p5718
aS" This is one of the main drawbacks of these tread, they simple don't work properly on smooth surfaces"
p5719
aS' SUSPENSION The suspension is working properly'
p5720
aS" You do need to apply some pressure, but all things considered it's not too bad"
p5721
aS" CRANE The crane has four degrees of freedom: Base rotation Lower boom Upper boom Hook It does what it's supposed to do"
p5722
aS' Base rotation and lower boom can be motorized and switched using the gearbox, while the upper boom and hook are operated manually'
p5723
aS' TIPPING BED The tipping is operated via a Mini LA'
p5724
aS' CONCLUSION While the set does offer various functions and features, driving and steering is a serious issue'
p5725
aS' Therefor this set is more likely to be showcased than to be played with'
p5726
aS' B-MODEL Instructions for the B-model are of high quality'
p5727
aS' Looking at the image below, you will see what I mean'
p5728
aS" Here's the finished B-model, a tracked Jeep with a communcations device"
p5729
aS' This alternate model looks so good, it could easily have made it as a main model'
p5730
aS' One thing that does pop in mind; how would this look with tires?! More on that later'
p5731
aS" When you are in the artcic region it's imperative to have proper communication channels"
p5732
aS" Since there's no internet backbone, you will need a big antenna of some sort"
p5733
aS' This B-model actually features a small trailer wagon with a transmitter/receiver'
p5734
aS" Here's more detailed image of the B-model, without trailer wagon"
p5735
aS' I would buy this model in a heartbeat if it were a main model'
p5736
aS' Simply gorgeous'
p5737
aS" The side view doesn't give away that this in alternate model"
p5738
aS' The stickers also work really well in this model'
p5739
aS' And again, nothing to complain here'
p5740
aS' The model even has a small crane at the rear, operated by the Mini LA'
p5741
aS' Here you can see the arctic fleet, comprised of both the A-model and B-model'
p5742
aS' I bet these two can get some work done!! A bit of a messy picture, but this should give you an impression of the size of both models'
p5743
aS' LEFTOVER PARTS Not too many parts left, which is obviously a good thing'
p5744
aS' ALTERNATE MODEL WITH TUMBLER TIRES Just like me, you probably have been wondering how this model would look like with (Tumbler) tires'
p5745
aS' Well, here it is'
p5746
aS' As I imagined it does look great'
p5747
aS" Admittedly, these are not the type of tires we ought to use, but to be honest; I don't really care"
p5748
aS' Again, the negative caster results in quirky steering'
p5749
aS' The tires are a bit too big, so they hit the chassis when you compress the suspension'
p5750
aS' While this has absolutely nothing to do with an arctic vehicle, I really love this picture'
p5751
aS" SUMMARY We're almost at the end of my review, so what do I think of this set"
p5752
aS" Let's start with getting the Elephant out of the room; this set lacks proper driving and steering"
p5753
aS" Does that make it a bad set?! Definitely not! It's a great set, but it lacks some playability when it comes to moving the vehicle"
p5754
aS" The crane and tipper bed do work properly, so there's still some playability left"
p5755
aS" Does this set look cool? Definitely! I think it's one of the coolest (no pun intended) and most original models of recent years"
p5756
aS' The orange and black color scheme works great and the stickers are well designed'
p5757
aS' The B-model is of very high quality and some might even prefer it over the A-model'
p5758
aS' And if you are not interested in either of these models, this set provides you with a variety of great parts! All in all I think this is a great set! Maybe not to play with, but it scores high on all other criteria'
p5759
aS" PROS Original model Great color scheme Lots of interesting parts Great B-model CONS Steering and driving don't work too well Repetitive build of undercarriages (minor con) SCORE Below are my scores based on different categories"
p5760
aS' 8 DESIGN Original and good looking model'
p5761
aS' 7 BUILDING EXPERIENCE Fun to build, albeit a bit repetitive'
p5762
aS' 8 FEATURES Packs quite a few features'
p5763
aS" 7 PLAYABILITY Some features work, some don't"
p5764
aS' 9 PARTS Comes with interesting parts'
p5765
aS' 9 VALUE FOR MONEY Two great model in a single set'
p5766
aS" 8 COOL! As a bonus, here's picture of the main model with Tumbler Tires"
p5767
aS' Why? Because we can!'
p5768
aS'Very timely review Jim'
p5769
aS' My wife has just surprised me by giving me this set a few days ago and I have just built the A model two days ago and B model yesterday'
p5770
aS' I agree with all that you wrote above'
p5771
aS" I don't have Tumbler tires but I have 9398 tires"
p5772
aS' Driving is smooth but steering + suspension will be bad as you said due to negative caster and tires hitting the chassis'

p5786

p5794
aS" Otherwise you would see that the cut off part is where there's a beam in front of the panel"
p5795

aS'REVIEW - 42001 - MINI OFF-ROADER INTRODUCTION Technic Mini models are sometimes regarded as models not worth buying'
p5853
aS" I don't agree with this opinion"
p5854
aS" Whether it's a special part or innovative building technique, almost every Mini model has something that makes the set worthwhile"
p5855
aS' This time I will be reviewing the 42001 Mini Off-Roader'
p5856
aS" This model is not a smaller version of an existing model, so there's no real comparison with a bigger brother, or sister if you will"
p5857
aS' Nor does the model resemble a real life brand or vehicle, so it is what it is, a Mini Off-Roader'
p5858
aS' Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions'
p5859
aS' SET INFORMATION Number: 42001 Title: Mini Off-Roader Theme: Technic Released: 2013 Part Count: 100 Box Weight: 165 gr Box Dimensions: 15,5 x 14,0 x 4,2 cm Set Price (MSRP): 9'

p5865
aS'130 USD Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX The box measures 15,5 x 14,0 x 4,2 cm which is obviously not very big'
p5866
aS' The weight of the box is approximately 165 grams'
p5867
aS' FRONTSIDE The front of the box shows a though four wheel drive off-roader challenging a fierce rocky mountain trail'
p5868
aS'now does it?! What the box actually shows is Mini Off-Roader challenging a small foam rock formation, much like rocks used in Star Trek The Original Series, yet smaller The box also states that this model is for the age of 7 till 14'
p5869
aS' More importantly, the 2-models in-1 logo is clearly visible, which means this set can be used to build two different models'
p5870
aS' BACKSIDE The backside shows a picture of the alternate model and a smaller version of the original model'
p5871
aS' The conversion arrow and the 2-in-1 are printed to clarify that the main model can be converted into a secondary model'
p5872
aS' SIDES One of the sides shows the 2-in-1 logo and a picture of the main model'
p5873
aS' Another side shows a picture of one of the wheels in actual size and again, a picture of the main model'
p5874
aS' CONTENTS OF THE BOX The box contains: 2 Booklets 2 Bags 4 Tires BOOKLETS This set contains two booklets which is not very common for a set this size'
p5875
aS' Both models share the same chassis, which is why the build has been divided over two booklets, one for the chassis (8 pages with 10 steps) and one for the bodywork (34 pages with 23 steps for the main model and 20 steps for the alternate model)'
p5876
aS' BAGS The box contains only 2 bags which is to be expected from a set consisting of 100 parts'
p5877
aS' One of the bags is filled with liftarms, panels, rims and two elastic bands'
p5878
aS' The other bags contains all the other parts, like pins, axles, connectors, etc'
p5879
aS' Opening the bags results in the following collection of parts, with the exception of the tires'
p5880
aS' No abundant number parts that will add real value to your collection'
p5881
aS' Nevertheless, there are some interesting orange parts and elastic bands'
p5882
aS' TIRES The tires are provided seperately (i'
p5883
ag3111
aS' not contained in the bags)'
p5884
aS' From the picture you can see that these tires have a front and a back side, so you should pay attention when fitting them to the rims, which have two different sides as well'
p5885
aS' HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This section describes the unique and/or highlighted parts'
p5886
aS' VERY SMALL SMOOTH TECHNIC PANEL (#21 AND #22) These two small Technic were new at the time of release and this set was only one of two sets containing them in orange'
p5887
aS' The other set is the 42007 - Moto Cross Bike'
p5888
aS" At the moment of writing there's a third set containing these parts, the Black Champion Racer"
p5889
aS" Side A Side B SMALL RUBBER BAND I was under the impression that these White Rubber Bands weren't that common, but it seems that these bands are as common as dirt"
p5890
aS" But hey, you can't have enough rubber bands! THIN LIFTARM 1x5 WITH AXLE HOLES Like the panels, these Liftarms were also new at the time of release"
p5891
aS' Looking at the the frequent usage in other sets, this part has proven to be a most useful mammal'
p5892
aS' THIN LIFTARM 1x3 Not a very rare piece per se, but if you are not into Bionicle, this liftarm part can be hard to find'
p5893
aS' Your other option would be to buy the 9390 - Mini Tow Truck, or the 8305 - Dual Bikes from a while ago (2000)'
p5894
aS" LONG PIN WITH CENTER PIN HOLE This relatively new kid on the block is currently used in many Technic and non-Technic sets and has well proven it's worth"
p5895
aS' AXLE PIN CONNECTOR HUB WITH 2 AXLES Like the previous part this newish part is also quite helpful in certain situations'
p5896
aS" PART LIST Here's the complete list for all 100 parts"
p5897
aS' BUILDING EXPERIENCE The build starts with the chassis of the Off-Roader'
p5898
aS' After connecting some liftarms two elastic bands, one on each side, are attached to the towball pins'
p5899
aS' This is all there is to the suspension, plain and simple'
p5900
aS' The two elastic bands contract the L-shaped liftarms, which results in the long ends swiveling downwards'
p5901
aS' The video below demonstrates the suspension'
p5902
aS" The simplicity doesn't do it justice, because it works like a charm"
p5903
aS' The suspension is very smooth with the right amount of stretch and resistance'
p5904
aS' This great working suspension adds a lot of value to this set'
p5905
aS' To quote John Hurt in the movie Contact: "Why build one when you can have two at twice the price?"'
p5906
aS' I have purchased two sets so we can simultaneously see both models and make a proper comparison'
p5907
aS' Below you can see two identical chassis which will be used for both versions of the build'
p5908
aS' At this stage we have arrived at the end of the first booklet, which only took about ten minutes'
p5909
aS' Not surprising, since the first booklet only has 10 building steps'
p5910
aS' Progressing to the second booklet, you need to choose between building the main and alternative model'
p5911
aS" That's a choice I don't need to make for this review, so let's start with the main model"
p5912
aS" MAIN MODEL When building the bodywork there's a rather peculiar building technique, which you wouldn't expect in an official LEGO set"
p5913
aS' The Axle and Pin Connector Hub with 2 Axles only protrudes halfway into the Double Bent Liftarm'
p5914
aS' The Thin 1x4 Liftarm which is added in one of the following steps makes sure the hubs stay perfectly in place, but I was still surprised to see this technique'
p5915
aS' The finished bodywork for the main model looks like'
p5916
aS'uhh'
p5917
aS'well'
p5918
aS"I don't know exactly"
p5919
aS" It doesn't bear any resemblance to a real life model, which makes it hard to judge"
p5920
aS" One thing's for sure; it's not the best looking Technic Mini Model"
p5921
aS' The bodywork can be attached to the chassis by using a 7L axle and two bushes, one on each side of the chassis'
p5922
aS" ALTERNATE MODEL Unfortunately the alternate model doesn't look much better than the main model"
p5923
aS" It's even a stud less wide, while you would like to see slightly more body, matching the size of the tires and chassis"
p5924
aS' Attached to the chassis the body is even more out of proportion'
p5925
aS" It's not really ugly and the color scheme is great (obviously this goes for the main model as well), but the body simply doesn't match the chassis"
p5926
aS' I can only imagine that this model is supposed to have a chibi look, much like the Microfighter Star Wars models'
p5927
aS' COMPARISON The following section shows a selection of images from different angles to compare the main and secondary model'
p5928
aS' The main model has a bit more volume, while the alternate model has a more sporty look'
p5929
aS' FRONT VIEW The main model has headlights which are attached at a higher point, while the alternate model has headlights which are placed more closely next to each other'
p5930
aS' REAR VIEW A slightly different setup in both models, where the main model again has higher placed rear lights'
p5931
aS' SIDE VIEW The side view shows that the panels are used differently in both models'
p5932
aS' The main models uses them as doors, while the alternate model uses them as engine cover (bonnet)'
p5933
aS' TOP VIEW The top view reveals that the main model might have room for a minifig PARTS LEFT The left image shows the parts which are left after building the main model, while the second image shows the parts left after building the alternate model'
p5934
aS' As you can see, the main model uses slightly more parts than the alternate model'
p5935
aS" FEATURES Besides the awesome suspension, which we already have discussed, there aren't a lot of features in this set"
p5936
aS" There's actually a single feature, which is only present in the main model"
p5937
aS"opening doors! Wow, impressive! Well, maybe we can't expect too much functionality in such a small model"
p5938
aS' SUMMARY The Off-Roader is a fun model which is fairly easy to build'
p5939
aS' The suspension is simple, yet very effective'
p5940
aS' The model could do better in the design department, but the suspension offers great playability and that is what this set is all about'
p5941
aS' The orange parts are not very common so they are an added bonus'
p5942
aS' All things considered this set is definitely worth the few bucks you need to spend on it'
p5943
aS' PROS Great suspension Fun to play with Some (semi) rare orange parts Great color scheme CONS No resemblence to an actual off-roader Not the best looking model SCORE Below are my scores based on different categories'
p5944
aS' 6 DESIGN Not the best looking Technic model'
p5945
aS' 7 BUILDING EXPERIENCE The suspension makes it fun to build'
p5946
aS' 7 FEATURES The suspension makes up for the lack of functionality'
p5947
aS' 8 PLAYABILITY The model has Car-Swooshability'
p5948
aS' 7 PARTS Some interesting orange parts'
p5949
aS' 8 VALUE FOR MONEY Great present for the younger builders'
p5950
aS' 7,1 ELASTIC Hope you enjoyed it! Thanks for reading and please rate this set at the top of this topic!'
p5951
aS'Once again, excellent review Jim! Than you for not skipping this small but pretty great set'
p5952
aS' I also got two of this and I have to say, I really admire the nifty suspension'
p5953
aS' Building a third bodywork for the same suspension system is still on my backlog'
p5954
aS'The suspension is indeed awesome'
p5955
aS" For it's size, this is a great set! Looking at the grades, I seem to have lowballed the score"
p5956
aS'Sad, i miss this set'
p5957
aS'Looks like you are late 2 years) Nice set that you can play on your working place while small pauses This set is very cool, especially when you can: 42001 chassis + imagination = http://www'

p5976
aS"for Broadside's Brig 6259! A set from 1991, with a handsome count of 64 pieces, 3 figures, and a sale price of $8"
p5977
aS"75! The building(and parrot): We'll start off with the front"
p5978
aS" It looks like a good solid building to hold those scurvy dogs! We yonder over to the left side: And see a nice open back: And yonder to the plain right side: Back to the left, we find the corner, with a nice area to rest your tired soldiers! We see the platform in the corner, a lovely place for soldiers to stand on! It's a bit"
p5979
aS"skimpy, so watch your step! The middle is blocked by some stones, assuring security! But still open enough to stand in! The jail is cramped, and fits only TWO people, but we only need one prisoner in this set :-) ! Moving up is the watch tower, a place for your soldier stand and stand watch or for silly parots to sit on! Here's the front middle part, again those stones blocking the way! Figures and Accesories: We have a delightful number of a soldier, a sailor, and a scurvy pirate! A lovely parot! And a generous assortment of weapons! That concludes our review"
p5980
aS" Overall: It's a fantastic little set, and great for army and supplies and bricks gathering! I can't find any faults with this set, it's just the neatest little thing you've seen in a port *wub* Highly recomended *y* "

aS'Hello, Well as this is my first review I hope you like it'
p6040
aS' The 7744 police station is simply fanstastic'
p6041
aS' The many minifigs and the vehicles makes it really nice'
p6042
aS' The great playabillaty and and great space makes it great for children I think'
p6043
aS' But latest but not least the pics! General Overview: The Front of the Box: The Back of the Box: Inside the Box: Top of the box: Instructions: The Minifigs: The Cars: Patrol Car: Dog Car: The Dog: The Motor: Well now the Police Station : The Mailbox: The Crime Report Room: The Handcuffs holder: Handcuff: Suspect who wears handcuffs: Jails: Satelite: Little Things: Water Machiene: And if you don?t like water, we have coffee to!: Well and as last: The interrogation room: Well this was the review'

aS' I hope you liked it! Bye'
p6045
aS'Thank you very much for the review, THE-FORCE! The new police station looks great! I really like its lovely interior - amazing! By the way: I have a question: Are there any beds, tables or/and seats for the prisoners in their cells?'

p6053
aS' I wanted to take a pic of that but it was impossible'
p6054
aS"Hooray assuming from the picture on the box we will also be getting the old police car and bike in blue aswell! I really like this set it seems the best police station we've had in a long time and what a great amount of figures! Thanks for this great insight the-force! ;-)"
p6055
aS"It's mine *wub*! Just got my Luke today from TRU in in Merrilville, IN"
p6056
aS" ;-)! So here's some pictures and thoughts: Still in the packing with the box Pieces out in the fresh air Put together, ready for some serious Vader vacking >:-)! If you this close you're so dead!! It's yet another lovely maquette *wub*! The only downside is that the LEGO SW sign doesn't even resemble (ok, I've exagurating a bit :'-)) the ones from the other maquettes! Check out this one from the Blackhole Trooper compared with the Luke one: The Luke one is has a massproduced look over it with just a printing |-/ , the other has depth & a painting on it"
p6057
aS" Now I'm waiting for the long overdue Boba one! Here's the other maquettes reviewed: Darth Vader & Stormie Blackhole Stormie Maquettes On copmike"

aS'thanks for the cool picture! How big are those Maquettes? Could you make a picture with a minifig next to the maquette please?'
p6075
aS'Ah yes, I saw a whole shelf of them in my TRU(touched it too!) Too small, and WAY overpriced'

p6079
aS'Not my thing, but a very nice review, thanks for sharing it! I was seriously considering this one when it was originally announced as a 6212 copack item at a particularly good price and then everything changed'
p6080
aS' I do, however, seriously ache to get my hands on one of the more traditionally LEGO looking 2ft+ Vaders they use in the official stores (at least they had one here in Orlando)'

aS'During the annual Thanksgiving Road Trip to the relatives, I stopped by the TRU in Portland, OR'
p6090
aS' Lo and behold, the new Mars Mission sets! Obviously, I bought them'
p6091
aS' ;-) The box: Not much to say'
p6092
aS' Standard box art for MM sets, nothing new'
p6093
aS' The parts: Some good parts here'
p6094
aS" Even if you don't like the set (Which I highly doubt after I've had my say :-P ), it's a decent parts pack"
p6095
aS' I noticed that some old parts have been renewed'
p6096
aS" I know the wheel has been used in the '07 sets, but the cockpit and hitch I haven't seen in a while"
p6097
aS' The VLDSS (Very large DSS)'
p6098
aS' Grr'
p6099
aS' New part'
p6100
aS' At least, I think it is'
p6101
aS" Someone slap me if it isn't"
p6102
aS' *wacko* The figs'
p6103
aS" I know I've seen that head before, but I have no idea where"
p6104
aS' Does anyone know? I was hoping that the aliens would have new arms, at least'
p6105
aS' I was sadly mistaken'
p6106
aS' On the upside, I finally discovered that they glow in the dark'
p6107
aS' :-$ The alien has a jetpack'
p6108
aS" If that's not the silliest thing I've ever seen, I don't know what is"
p6109
aS' The build'
p6110
aS' Simple build'
p6111
aS' A block'
p6112
aS' So easy a caveman cou- oh, never mind'
p6113
aS" Geico's used that one enough"
p6114
aS' Then, we have this jobber right here'
p6115
aS' Not sure what it is, but it looks like some crystal scanning device'
p6116
aS" It's starting to look pretty nice"
p6117
aS' It almost looks practical'
p6118
aS' The cockpit is suffering from a bad dose of over-stickering'
p6119
aS' On the upside, we have a new piece there to hold the cockpit on'
p6120
aS' Part 1 complete'
p6121
aS" It has a nice little radio antenna, which is ruined by the use of a random missile that looks like it's going to shoot the antenna before it shoots the alien"
p6122
aS' Still, I never say no to a good missile I can use for something else'
p6123
aS' The trailer: Fairly simple, but it works'
p6124
aS" It features stabilizing arms, a handheld saw, and an extremely random mini-bot who's purpose escapes me"
p6125
aS' The Whole Meal Deal- Erm, general pics'
p6126
aS' Overall, I thought this was a good set'
p6127
aS' In fact, it reminds me of this:'
p6128
aS"Finally we have seen the light!!! I've been waiting for a while deciding if I was gonna get this"
p6129
aS"well I've decided after that wonderful review I am! Good job reviewin!! *wub*"
p6130
aS"Cool review, thanks!! :-D I personally think the minirobot is awesome, and (dare I say) cute! This was described on Amazon to be a mobile lab, I'm not seeing that"
p6131
aS' I do however see a crystal hauling vehicle'
p6132
aS' *sweet* Pretty cool, not as bad as previous sets'

aS"Thanks for the review, it's a neat little set"
p6150
aS' I hope it comes to Australia sooner rather than later'
p6151
aS' That minifig head was also used in 7699 MT-101 so that may be why it seems familiar'

p6154
aS' But I think where I did see it is the lego Magazine, in the article on Biff Barker'
p6155
aS'Thanks for the review! *sweet* Aside from the fact that I like the model, this set has a few new and useful pieces so I will have to get it! *wub*'
p6156
aS'thanks for the review'
p6157
aS' I still will not get this set'
p6158
aS' Speechless about it'
p6159
aS'A wonderful set and, perhaps, as close to Classic Space as possible'
p6160
aS" *y* Also there?s a great amount of very useful and interesting parts too like these round 'stabilizer' parts with clip"
p6161
aS" :'-) There?s a complete different feeling with this new sets compared to the first MM ones"
p6162
aS' 8-| Beside the a little more realistic aspects of it with the more enclosed cockpit (nearly with some controls'
p6163
aS' ;-) ) it?s the overall more solid feeling I guess'
p6164
aS' The other sets look pretty neat and fashionable at the surface, but their internal structure is much more hollow and useless with some studless technic beams and such stuff'
p6165
aS' very shining, but hard and boring to MOD, just aimed for maximal cool looking box art and the rest went down for saving costs'
p6166
aS' (beside that already pretty good 7692 Dropship that is)'
p6167
aS' The only thing I don?t get with that is why the minirobot?s a one-armed one'
p6168
aS' ach, Pirates on Mars I suppose'
p6169
aS' X-D'
p6170
aS'that head might have been from rock raiders'

p6175
aS' Thanks for the review'
p6176
aS'Great review, but am I the only one who thinks this is a pretty homely looking vehicle? The small exploration robot is cool, but the large windscreen on the main vehicle reminds me about Jack Stone! I also think the bases of the vehicle parts are very basic and look almost unfinished with the holes and such'
p6177
aS' I think I will pass this one, even though the alien has a jet pack and there is the nice mini vehicle'
p6178
aS'Tks for the great review MM ;-) Its always appreciated to have reviews of new set'
p6179
aS" Having said that I really don't see the point of that set and its such money and time wasted IMO"
p6180
aS" I don't like that theme apart the dropship and 6wheeler and that tiny vehicle doesn't do the trick for me"
p6181
aS' I see it as a really cheap excuse to try and please Classic Space fan with that horrendous MM graphics and what amazes me is that you guys loke that :-D Money saved On !! *yoda*'

p6215
aS'Thanks for posting the picture of this new MM set'
p6216
aS' When I first saw the Mars Mission sets I was a little apprehensive about the design and the aliens (They could have at least make movable arms :(), but anyways when I bought the small fighter I was totally hook'
p6217
aS' My fave set from the line is the mech'
p6218
aS'During the annual Thanksgiving Road Trip to the relatives, I stopped by the TRU in Portland, OR'
p6219
aS' Lo and behold, the new Mars Mission sets! Predictably, I bought them'
p6220
aS' I present to you: the MX-41 Switch Fighter! Man, what a long name'
p6221
aS' The box: Standard MM'
p6222
aS' On the front, it shows the Fighter in flight mode, and a yellow note telling you that it transforms'
p6223
aS' The back shows three pictures showing it happen'
p6224
aS' The parts: Once I open the box, the first thing that comes out is a bent and rolled up instruction booklet, and I was forced to put it under a stack of beer books for an hour'
p6225
aS" Then, there's the DSS"
p6226
aS' Yes, two of the stickers do feature a cobra'
p6227
aS" I wonder why, because this set's decal should be a beatle"
p6228
aS' X-D Decent parts, nothing too special'
p6229
aS' Then, I noticed this little part'
p6230
aS" It's used for the flick-missiles, but I have no idea what else it would be used for"
p6231
aS" :-/ The Build: The alien ship: When I looked at the box art for this set, I was releived to see that the aliens don't have another curved-forward wing ship"
p6232
aS' Instead, they have this little beauty, which appears to be the Alien Mini Cooper- small and hot'
p6233
aS' *wub* Anyway, partially completed'
p6234
aS" Even if you don't like the set, it has some nice green flame peices, which work nicely for space laser swords"
p6235
aS' Fully completed'
p6236
aS' The only annoying bit about it is that the crystal-holding thing in front wobbles all over the place'
p6237
aS' The alien fits into it by way of impalement'
p6238
aS' It must hurt getting in and out'
p6239
aS' Switch fighter (cockpit): The set makes good use of the Alpha Team cockpit'
p6240
aS" For controls, it has a meagre handlebar that the astronaught can't even reach"
p6241
aS' The rear "shell" of the fighter starts out around the alien containment chamber'
p6242
aS" It's a bit odd that the containment chamber has an alien sticker, because the instruction booklet lists it as holding crystals"
p6243
aS' The crystal canister is held back by a technic pin'
p6244
aS' This is, without a doubt, the ugliest color arrangment EVER'
p6245
aS' Warning: Mass stickers'
p6246
aS' :-X The cockpit fits into grooves in the "shell"'
p6247
aS' Then it clicks into place in a 1x1 brick with a horizontal clip'
p6248
aS' The wing "mechanism": The wing'
p6249
aS' For some reason, the body of the "mechanism" has a blue brick'
p6250
aS' *wacko* The wing and "mechanism" connect to prevent the fighter doing a nosedive while in tank mode'
p6251
aS' The wing "mechanism" completed: The underside: The body and wing connect by way of a miscolored red brick'
p6252
aS" I have no idea why it's red- black would bave been much, much better"
p6253
aS' Completed'
p6254
aS' Tank mode: All in all, this looks pretty neat'
p6255
aS" The wheel base is pretty short, but it's not bad"
p6256
aS' Transform! The set transforms neatly, if ungainly'
p6257
aS' Without "Anti-grav" support, it would fall forward on it\'s nose each time it transformed'
p6258
aS' Jet mode'
p6259
aS" It's all right, but it could be a bit better"
p6260
aS' The "shell" keeps slipping back forward to the "tank mode" because there\'s nothing to stop it sliding'
p6261
aS' Spare parts: Overall: I thought this set was great'
p6262
aS' It could do with some fixing, such as the mismatched colors, but it should be a definate buy for MM fans'

p6267
aS'*wub* Thanks for another great review'
p6268
aS' *sweet* I am also glad that it is a very different alien fighter design as I already have three varients of the old type! The fighter transforms better than I thought it would; I was expecting just the wings'

aS" Well, since anti-grav doesn't exist, and will never exist, there has to be another option! Looking at it in tank mode it does have a vague aerofoil shape so I think it should be able to work as a lifting body"
p6273
aS' All it needs to do then is move fast enough to start taking off and then it can extend the wings'

p6278
aS'I mean think about it'
p6279
aS' "How can it support itself without anti-grav while transforming?" The answer? It can\'t *sweet* :-P'
p6280
aS'Hmm, Its actually a nice bit better than I expected, and great review, thanks! But think ill pass on this one'
p6281
aS' I quite like the alien fighter though, heh'
p6282
aS' And loved the way you described how he sat in the cockpit'
p6283
aS'Very cool review, Mr'
p6284
aS" Mandalorian! This isn't a bad set, the alien craft is very sleek (if only they'd gone with the old alien body in trans-green"
p6285

p6286
aS' The tank mode looks sweet'

p6289
aS' By the way thanks for the great review'
p6290
aS'Thanks for that very good review, Mr'
p6291
aS' Mandalorian! *y* I think that this is a plain beautiful set, oh how I wish that TLC would?ve taken that direction from the beginning'
p6292
aS" :'-) The design is much more practicable, with fewer non-system parts and technic beams with(!) studs"
p6293
aS' this makes everything much more easier to MOD and a lot more useful, at least IMO'
p6294
aS' *y* So it?s for sure not very hard to make the (wonderful enclosed) cockpit one brick higher, and even that little Alien Ship looks decent and nice'
p6295
aS' X-O And the fighter looks sleek and elegant too, in both modes! That?s just very cool, compliments, TLC'
p6296
aS' Now all we need?re aliens with moving arms and here we go, Classic Space on forever! X-D'
p6297
aS'Thanks for a very thorough review'
p6298
aS' I might think about getting this'
p6299
aS' I really like the mini alien fighter, and the transformation idea is always a welcome one'
p6300
aS" Both modes look pretty good, despite the some of the odd coloured bricks (which I'd MOD out)"
p6301
aS' You know what it reminds me of? Some of the futuristic designs in the Gerry Anderson series'
p6302
aS'Wow'
p6303
aS" This is actually quite a neat set! It is definitively my favorite in the line after the big drilling unit! \\begin{geek} I'm not sure it would nose dive when transforming from tank mode"
p6304
aS" I guess it would pick up speed and transform quickly since it doesn't seem to have any downwards pointing thrusters"

p6310
aS' I liked that about the classic space stuff because it really helped create the environment'

aS' If that happened, transformation would be harder as the wheels would dig into the ground and drag through the soil'
p6325
aS" Then it'd nose dive"
p6326
aS"Great review Mr Mandalorian! *y* I'm not a fan of MM and don't like this set much, but it has some neat features"
p6327
aS' But the only way I can see it transforming is by racing off a cliff and swinging its wings out *wacko* To the Brickmobile! >:-)'
p6328
aS'and another tks and congrats MM on that review !! Like the o?her post I think that this set is a wastre of time and money and shelfspace'
p6329
aS' Its such a ripp off from that ugly Alfa Team crapjet'
p6330
aS' I do not like the design of the jet itself: the small flags as front is so lame !! And I don\'t like those orange wheels as engines !! Furthermore I don\'t like the "rover" mode either !! The only cool thing about it is the special martian jet which they should ahve sold separatly :-P At least some interesting parts but that far from saving that set IMO |-/ Money Saved On once again :-P *yoda*'

p6335
aS' *sweet* Wonder if the range might have an issue seeing it\'s held in there but who knows, maybe they now "pop" out with a greater velocity than a mere finger flick? I had resorted to technic 1/2 bushings (smooth) to lock in the missile\'s technic axle (with stud)'

p6383
aS' Looking forward to the rest of the review! Edited by Exo-builder59, 27 November 2007 - 04:04 AM'

p6389
aS'Sweeeet'
p6390
aS" *wub* It's nice to finally see a set that's not bipedal or (?) Tripedal"
p6391
aS' Quote Exo-Force is an anomaly in my LEGO interests'
p6392
aS" I don't know why I like it so much or why I keep buying it but I do"
p6393
aS" That would be a problem, wouldn't it? :-P Quote The cockpit itself is constructed very well but the canopy seems like an afterthought, closing on to the robot's head and leaving his back and sides completely exposed"
p6394
aS' I dunno'
p6395
aS' At least it has a canopy, unlike past sets'
p6396
aS"Thanks Hinckley! It's always nice to see your reviews, and I can't wait to see the story mode (from the pic, I guess it will include Sinner and Hinckley, instead of Bianca and Gavin, right? 8-| ) LuxorV"
p6397
aS"Thanks for this fantastic review Hinckley, I can't wait to see the comic! :'-) I REALLY love this mech as I am a fan of non-bipedal mechs (though I am terrible at making them), the purple is great and I can't wait to see what MOCers will use those awesome new spike peices for! 3 robots in one mech is a really good deal too, and that spider droid just adds so much more to the set"
p6398
aS' And thanks for taking the time to do this! *sweet* Not to sound like a smartypants though, but the grill peice in purple is not the first time this has happened, two were included in the 06 Joker Helicopter ;-) Thanks again! To the Brickmobile! >:-)'
p6399
aS'Awesome Reveiw thanks for the pics!! Did the instructions come with a comic?'
p6400
aS'Thanks for that very neat review, Hinckley! *y* This set looks indeed very interesting, with a very cool antlike look and a simple but essential overall design'
p6401
aS' The cockpit seems better protected than many other EF ones, that spine?s lovely and the way these Iron Drones?re attached is simple but effective'
p6402
aS' :-) And hey, did I miss something or?re there really no crappy shooting devices'
p6403
aS'? :-P Thanks to the minirobots and their inventor I guess'
p6404

p6406
aS' :-/ Thanks Hinck! ~VBBN~'
p6407
aS'Great review as always, Hinckley'
p6408
aS" Frankly I'm in love with this thing"
p6409
aS" So much so, in fact, that I've been calling it 'Shadow Panther' for weeks, but never mind"
p6410
aS" Anyway, why do I like it? Well, purple is such a fantastic Lego colour- it's sparingly used, which makes it interesting, and it simply looks great"
p6411
aS' Those jetpack/backpack things the robots are wearing, and if they are jetpacks, as the back of the box suggests, then the use of chaisaws is quite nifty and innovative'
p6412
aS' The minibot is cool, and certainly an interesting gimmick'
p6413
aS" Sure, they don't look quite as good in some of the other sets, but here it looks great"
p6414
aS' The overall structure and design are cool too'
p6415
aS" It's always nice to see an 'irregular' mech, and this is no exception"
p6416
aS" It's especially cool whee the spines are concerned"
p6417
aS" Plus, on top of all that, it's got a nice selection of parts, including some lovely new ones, and the inlaid box is interesting"
p6418
aS' Well worth getting, I think'
p6419
aS'Another fantastic review, Hinckley'
p6420
aS" I really like this set, I wasn't to keen on it when I first saw the pictures bit having seen the review, I am starting to like it"
p6421
aS' It seems quite sturdy, and it makes a change from the usual 2 legged mechs'
p6422
aS' As well as that purple is welcome anywhere, I have such a shortage of that colour! I like the rusty orange colour of the robots, and their back/jet packs are quite cool, and the mini robot looks sweet'
p6423

p6519
aS" I'll most likely get, mostly for the figs and parts"
p6520
aS' I reckon it would look a lot better alongside the rest of the 2008 EF mechs'
p6521
aS' Anyway, thanks for the review! To the Brickmobile! >:-)'
p6522
aS"Thanks for this other great review, Hinckley *y* ! You sure you don't work as one of TLC's PRs? X-D ;-) Everytime I see one of your reviews I want to buy the set, and that is sweet to me, but bad for my money 8-| LuxorV"
p6523
aS'Thanks for that good review, Hinckley'
p6524
aS' *y* A really interesting set and a turning point for LEGO'
p6525
aS' Minirobots instead of shooting crap, pretty cool'
p6526
aS' I hope the kids?ll like it too'
p6527
aS' For the design, I love that asymmetrical look of the front part and the sleek guns of the flyer'
p6528
aS' It?s smart that the gatling gun moves along with the tank, too'
p6529
aS' The set idea with two vehicles in one?s not new, but very play- able and the treads/big wheel design?s cool'
p6530
aS' I don?t like the use of studless technic beams, but well, they do their job I guess'
p6531
aS' And Keiken?s cockpit should be easy to improve'

aS' if I should have any :-D As always, very professional review Hinckley!'
p6541
aS'I think this is probably my least favourite set of next years selection, but I still might get it, partly because of this review (thanks, btw)'
p6542
aS' I quite like the mini-robot, and while there are a few problems (the front cockpit, the exposed axles) I relish the idea of MODing them out, and correcting them'
p6543
aS' And the change back to the original figs is welcome'
p6544

p6566
aS' :-P'
p6567
aS"Hinkley, you are the MAN! Your reviews just keep on getting better and better! Although all of the sets this year are great and I love them all to bits, I can't say there was one that I absolutely felt like something I'd buy except for the Storm Lasher"
p6568
aS' But with this review, I think this will be the first purchase of 2008 for me! I totally agree with you on how the Spider looks better without Mini-robot'
p6569
aS' But from looking at where the cockpit is placed and how the skull on the cockpit is lodged underneath the walker, maybe the mini-robot would look better mounted underneath the head? That way it looks more even and even gives the thing a nasty set of teeth! I gotta try it out once I get it'
p6570
aS" Can't wait for the Fabuland comics! Keep it up, Hink!"

aS'Here is my review of the set 6265 Sabre Island! Overview: Sabre Island was release in 1990 an it contained 92 pieces and its retail price was $15'
p6599
aS'50'
p6600
aS' It comes with 3 Imperial Blue coats, and a nice outpost for them'
p6601
aS' The pictures + full review: Anyway, you can see here a picture of the box, the model shown on the box differs from the actual model slightly'
p6602
aS'And the back of the box, which shows some nice alternative models from the pieces provided'
p6603
aS' A close up of two or three of the alternative models'
p6604
aS' And now for the minifigs'
p6605
aS' I prefer the Red coats over the Blue coats but these minifigs are nice, and for the number of pieces one gets a fair amount of them'
p6606
aS' The set itself makes a nice small outpost, it comes complete with a palm tree, a cannon (with ammo) on a turntable, a small tower a nice large Imperial flag and a little red row boat! Here is a shot from ground level showing the cannon and Blue coat (patrolling the out post!) The rowing boat was a nice touch, and it comes with a small flag too'
p6607
aS' "No Pirates will avoid the wrath of myself and my mighty Island!" The top of the tower is rather plain and simple which in some ways is good, as it keeps the whole set detailed yet not crowded, but I feel a little something should of been added to the top though'
p6608
aS' The back is lacking any type of walls, so one can play with the minifigs inside, yet their are also no stairs or any other ways for the Blue Coats to climb up their tower either! The rag tag pirates attack Sabre Island! But never fear, The Lord Of Pies is here! Me throwing a pie at Captain Ironhook from another angle'
p6609
aS' Overall I think this is a very good, if somewhat simple set, and makes a great cheap Imperial set! Comments, thoughts and Opinions are welcome! (And sorry about the darkness in some photos, I have not had time to take photographs when it is till light recently, for when I return home it is dark |-/ ) Edit: Fixed, Thank you!

p6613
aS'I gave it a 4'
p6614
aS'Why? Very good bits: -3 epaulettes for 3 gurads! -Patterned wall parts -Cannon Bad bits: -No pirates to fight -Title is rather grand for an outpost -Top needs battlements, not very low lattices -Needs a more substantial base - the wall goes right into the sea! - Surely the whole thing would sink'

aS' Besides all that, this set just looks beautiful'

aS' I love the colors (blue baseplate and the white/yellow tower)'

aS' One of the best little/medium sized sets ever made by Lego!'

p6675
aS'its a fantastic set, cant think of anything wrong with it to be honest, even if the island is a bit small, the plate itself is still useful, and the rest of it is also very useful, walls can go toward a bigger fort, cannon can extend your ship, soldiers extend your army, boat extends err your boats, and the island prin is just cool'
p6676

aS' Sinister, I needed a gas station that could handle a lot more traffic (especially military traffic and these new 6-wide vehicles X-D )'
p6684
aS' Here be a thumblink to the original station at BL: I love this station so much, but it really needed some modernization'
p6685
aS' The reopening of this station received a lot of attention, even the local police stopped right over'
p6686
aS" One big upgrade to this station is the selling of propane tanks, which is generally a rare commodity from the lego towns i've seen"
p6687
aS' X-D Also at this service station is a propane tank refilling station'
p6688
aS' The milkman is our first propane customer'
p6689

p6690
aS' For instance, this building now has florescent lighting, a big frig in the back, and more shelf space'
p6691
aS" *y* Oh look! there's the officer purchasing a mountain dew"
p6692
aS" Now that there's more shelf space, we can sell more than just 1x1 round yellow bricks and levers"
p6693
aS' We now have available 1x1 round plates and 1x1 round cones available in multiple colors! :-D With this upgraded gas station, hopefully this town will bring in more business and customers into my small town'

p6731
aS' yes it is '
p6732
aS' I never noticed until I just checked! :-$ Will post a pic of the alternate face when my camera battery is charged :) Quote Where do the snakes come out? They sit on a pivoting plate behind the Star Wars heiroglyphics'
p6733
aS' You press down on a brick at the back and the plate drops and they fall out from underneath'
p6734
aS' Quote And about the stickers, have you tried putting them on the long bricks above the breakable walls? well, yes '
p6735
aS' that was where I guessed they were meant to go '

p6756
aS'LOL! Those Star Wars heiroglyphics are awesome! Were those in the movie? Or is this just a joke by the Lego designers? That would be the first time TLC showed any kind of reference humor! The rest of the set is great too, even the skeleton and the stickers'
p6757
aS" YES, that's right, I actually like those things"
p6758
aS" I like the new skellies because of their posability (I'm a big supporter & user of stop-motion) and I think there's nothing wrong with stickers"
p6759
aS" I mean seriously, why does everybody hate stickers so much??? :-| Sure, they are a pain in the megablocks to put on and, sure, they come off after a while and are never usable again, but hey, you don't have to put them on, even better, you can save them (like I do) and use them for your mocs! Could somebody tell me, please? I'm just curious"

p6779
aS'My 2nd review (what a veteran) '
p6780
aS' again, found this set via a shop assistant, in my local TRU (Portsmouth, UK) this evening'
p6781
aS' Comes in at ?44'
p6782
aS'99, which, is pretty steep, but, you get quite a bit for your money'
p6783
aS' Front of the Box : Back of the Box : Back of the Box Closeup : Contents : It was a nice surprise to get numbered bags '
p6784
aS" not had a large set with numbered bags for quite a while, at least in none of the sets I've bought recently! Didn't take a close up of the stickers, but I was quite disappointed that the curved pieces had stickers "
p6785
aS' if they could print the ATT curved pieces, why not these? Minifigs : Oh '
p6786
aS" and there's a nice backprint on the Pilot figure : Now, the build was pretty good "
p6787
aS' you build the plane first (after the minifigures)'
p6788
aS' Quite an interesting build in a way, becayse for a while you think the back is the front '
p6789
aS' and then you realise, heh! Now '
p6790
aS" I've not seen the film in a while, but I don't recall a guy flying a plane with a fishing rod "
p6791
aS" don't flame me if this is what happens, see earlier point regards not seeing the film in ages!! :-P After that, you build the temple in stages, starting with the entrance first, and then the holey floor section with the spears"
p6792
aS' These spears are just loosely placed into technic holed bricks'
p6793
aS' Quite easy to make em flick out but they can go anywhere! hehe Entrance : Holey Floor & Spears : These two parts are hinged and on an angle to each other and the gap makes for a handy bottomless pit, complete with pole for Indy to swing over with his whip'
p6794
aS' After that, you create the door and the ratchet mechanism to keep it raised'
p6795
aS' After that, you add the runners for the ball and the swinging knives trap'
p6796
aS' Swords Trap - Before : After : Finally, you build the statue that holds the efigy'
p6797
aS' Nice bit of construction here, especially the way that everything falls over once the efigy is removed'
p6798
aS' Do be careful when putting the curved bits on though '
p6799
aS' it appears one of the edges on mine has slightly bent when putting it on '
p6800
aS' nowt noticable though'
p6801
aS' Temple : Preparing to steal : Run!! You can see that the temple has toppled and debris has fallen all around '
p6802
aS' And then, as he goes through the door, the door falls (he gets his hat) and then the rock ball starts a rolling! Ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun!! The stickers were a pain though '
p6803
aS" there's no room for a border around the sticker here! Beware!! After all that is done, you join all the pieces together and it makes more a really good playset"
p6804
aS" Plenty of opportunity for recreating scenes here! Idol Closeup : Total Set : Spares : Yet more spare stickers??! (sorry, i've already put the spares in my box of bits!) Overall, 8 out of 10 "
p6805
aS' lots of play value and a pretty nice build'
p6806
aS' Too many stickers though '
p6807
aS' and defo poor arms for the skeletons! Edited by imperialshadows, 01 June 2008 - 12:18 PM'

p6852
aS'this set is pretty nice i love the idol id probably buy the set just for that :-D lol is it just me or in the earlier concepts of this set we saw a native on the box? i wonder why they removed it :-( *wacko*'
p6853
aS"Tks so much Big Pete for thisd awsome review of yet another fantastic Indy sets !! Its clearly one of the best lines of all times with SW 8-? That idol is superb and I love all the details of that set: loads of cool defense mechanisms, sweet vegetation and yeay another black carrot torch :-P And those MFs are really nice !! I am so happy to see Lego go dark tan *wub* Now I clearly can't wait to enjoy building this set ;-) Fertility Idol On !! *yoda*"
p6854
aS'i just noticed another inconsistency between box art and the actual set '
p6855
aS" on the box, the biplan has white wing supports (they're just plane windows without glass in them) and yet the set they are dark grey (or is it bley "
p6856
aS' can never tell the difference without careful study)'
p6857
aS' Add to that '
p6858
aS' the outer of the engine at the front is white on the box and black in the set'
p6859
aS" We don't normally have this many inconsistencies do we ?"
p6860
aS'This set is so cool'
p6861
aS" and another must buy! :-$ I'm in trouble next year it seems"
p6862
aS' The figs are great! *wub* I think the plane is only OK; perhaps they should have made that in a separate set as it needed to be a certain size to fit the figs, but that meant that the tail is way too short'
p6863
aS' Here is a picture of the actual plane so you can see what I mean'
p6864
aS' (Notice the pilot is fishing'
p6865
aS' ;-) ) The temple is another story; I think Lego have done an incredible job with this, fitting in the key parts of this sequence without making an absurdly large model'
p6866
aS" Addtionally, there are many parts in this set that I haven't got so it shouldn't be too hard to justify"
p6867
aS' X-D Thanks for another great review'
p6868
aS' *sweet* I love the photo of Indy running with the idol and the boulder close behind'

aS' :-/ EDIT: Yes there was one'
p6871
aS" Big Pete, on Dec 16 2007, 11:28 PM, said: We don't normally have this many inconsistencies do we ? Quite annoying ones too"
p6872
aS' I think the plane looks better with those being white'
p6873
aS"Because of exams and other obligations, I haven't posted this sooner"
p6874
aS' Seeing that no-one else has reviewed this set, I thought I might as well do it myself'
p6875
aS' The set in its entire glory (minus the slammer, instructions and the (obviously) massive sticker sheet) The four cars included in this set; a muscle car, a sports car, a roadster and the police off-roader(!): Because the police obviously have no clue that an off-roader is useless for catching street-racers, no less a batmobile-ish sports car, it will always trail behind: But the police have a trick up their sleeve - the drawbridge: Gotcha! And the mechanism that makes it all tick: The motor is nothing more than a (slow) pull-back motor'
p6876
aS' Push down the bridge, the latch will hook on to the gear and keep it in place until the latch is released'
p6877
aS" And there's the new gas station"
p6878
aS" Staying within theme, this gas-station is, like the tanker in 8147, from the company Fuel 4 Speed: There's a notable presence of detail here, such as the soda-dispenser, water (coolant?) bottles and other accesories, two fuel pumps and bumper-level railings to prevent cars from crashing into them"
p6879
aS" There's no interior however"
p6880
aS' And as demonstrated here by a loyal Octan-employee and a pursuing officer, the gas station is built to minifig-scale: My impressions of this set: As a collector of tiny turbos, and yet to miss a set, I got this one regardless of what it included'
p6881
aS' The gas station is indeed very nice, and the minifig-scale accesories were unexpected'
p6882
aS' The lack of interior is no big issue, and the both the station and bridge can with ease be implemented into a mini-fig town'
p6883
aS' The bridge also solidly built, and includes the ramps in its design, so it can be lifted, with ramps attached, without breaking apart'
p6884
aS' The slammer included in the set is identical, apart from the white color, with those in 8147'
p6885
aS" The cars are also very nice, altough I am yet to get used to the yellow batmobile, as I've grown accustomed to calling it"
p6886
aS" I also love the off-roader's chunky tires, they make perfect wheels for the newer minifig-scale cars"
p6887
aS' I never consider price/parts ratio, and here it would, for me, be irrelevant, because it will never be demolished for parts'
p6888
aS" The play value is what I would consider pretty good, and while the bridge won't rise with a car on it, it's still strong enough to stay open with a car tipping over the edge"
p6889
aS' Hmm'
p6890
aS' Every nerve in my body is saying that this sets is worth roughly 8/10, so: Verdict: 8/10 Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 07:01 PM'
p6891
aS' Indexed'
p6892
aS"Looks like a nice set, I like the tiny turbos and have most of the older individual cars, but I am put off by the ever increasing price of the large sets with lots of extra parts that I'm not really interested in"
p6893
aS' I wish these were available as individual vehicles as well'
p6894
aS"Thanks for the review! It's really cool that the petrol station is mini-fig scaled, I wasn't expecting that! :-D ~Peace"

p6925
aS' I read Eurobricks daily and this really raises the bar in terms of how a person does a review'
p6926
aS' Please do not resize your pics, they are perfect, crisp, large, thorough, and clear; it gives anyone who really wants info on the set just about everything they need to know about it'

p6932

aS'Heres all the parts in assorted baggies, and the horribly messed up instructions'
p6934
aS' Four astronauts and four aliens, with an extra gold visor (yay!) Not bad'

p6936

p6943
aS' Heres the start of the command base'
p6944
aS' More of the main structure, will be adding lots of things to all the little beams'
p6945
aS' Heres a storage container and the surprisingly not flimsy radar'
p6946
aS' On this side we see the alien elevator'
p6947
aS' It uses a HORRIBLY long technic rod, I have not seen one of this proportion, its like, a foot and a half long'
p6948
aS' More of the inner base where all the little tubes shall go'
p6949
aS' All the connected tubes and such'
p6950
aS' I also encountered a problem'
p6951
aS' In the instructions it says for the end of the elevator prong to be touching the tube connector where it is shown here, but mine has a 1x space inbetween'
p6952
aS' No matter'
p6953
aS' Heres the completed base'
p6954
aS' + My knee'
p6955
aS' Again'
p6956
aS' Onto the spaceship'
p6957
aS' The bulk of it is just technic supporting beams, with some large slope peices covering it all up'
p6958
aS' More on that later'
p6959
aS' The white coverup'
p6960
aS' The middle section lifts up to store the overly large jetpack'
p6961
aS' As you see, the storage containers take up most the bulk in the back, and you can see the jetpack on the ground'
p6962
aS' Aswell as the trigger hand hold thing that allows you to swoosh it'
p6963
aS' Look, in the back! Lego Greebles! Despite the large cockpit, it only holds one person, laying down'
p6964
aS' The wings are really the saving grace - double layered with a nice two toned effect'
p6965
aS' Kitty nudged me this picture so its abit blurry, my apologies :-| Extra peices and or peices I have no idea where the hell they go'
p6966
aS' :-P Overall, the set is quite fun I must admit'
p6967
aS' Full price, I probably would not go for it, But I got it for just under 70 dollars'
p6968
aS' For that price I can confidently say its quite worth it, many useful peices, nice figures (other than the aliens) and the tube things are quite fun to boot, even though I liked the life on mars system more, which I also have'
p6969
aS' None the less, its very fun to make them shoot around'
p6970
aS' Alright, so its not much of a command base either, and it looks abit bare'
p6971
aS" But it's still fun, even if you ignore the nerf section"
p6972
aS' Overall I give it a hardy 3'
p6973
aS'5 out of 5, the openness and epic fail of a missile launcher are hard to get by, but overall, its a dandy set :-D Merry Christmas *wub*'
p6974
aS"Thanks for the review Brickmaster! I wanted this set at first but I realized I don't want it as much anymore, seems like a waste of 90$"
p6975
aS'I just want the ship'
p6976
aS'Just the ship'
p6977
aS"I don't recall mine having an alignment problem on the tubes"
p6978
aS' could you perhaps take a closer picture of the area? Did yours also have two of the same sticker for the wings of the alien craft?'
p6979
aS'Thanks for this review'
p6980
aS" Lots of minifigs is a plus, although half of them are junk jellies, but dang the base just doesn't seem impressive"
p6981
aS' It looks so cheap, like a skeleton'
p6982
aS' The tubes are just ridiculous'
p6983
aS" But hey, at least it comes with two cool spacecraft, that's nice"
p6984
aS'I agree, it does seem very scarce, but Ive taken apart the nerf launcher, made a new module with the tube the launcher used, and beefed up the base with some computers and other things'
p6985
aS' For 90 dollars I would pass, I agree'
p6986
aS' On sale it is lovely, though'
p6987
aS' And none the less ive been entertained for ages with them flyin through the tubes :-D'
p6988
aS'Thanks for the review Brickmaster! This set looks nice, I really like the orange (*wub*) and white colour scheme, although the purple of the LoM base was very cool too'
p6989
aS' I only have the LoM base, if you have it built could you show a comparison? On an unrelated note, by the time I realised the red and blue hangers on the LoM base were for the red and blue mechs, the mechs were no longer in stores'
p6990
aS" :'-( I was a bit slow, huh? :-P Anywho, this is one set I won't be buying, although if the rocket was sold separately I'd get that"
p6991
aS' :-D Thanks again'
p6992
aS' *y* ~Peace'
p6993
aS"Should be here's the completed base and my Knee In Cordoroys (sp?) Great review"
p6994
aS'Thanks for the photos and review Brickmaster'
p6995
aS" I'm hoping to find this on sale as well"
p6996
aS' no luck so far'
p6997
aS' I love the white ship, and I think the base would be amusing, but ultimately hard to re-use'
p6998
aS' Incidentally, that long axel is common in recent technic sets, but I think it was orignally made for the hockey sets'
p6999
aS' :-D'

p7042
aS" It's the new flat piece used in 4996 Beach House, it just doesn't work as well"
p7043
aS" Without the original bevelled edge it doesn't seal the window and there is small noticable gap around the edge"
p7044
aS' Not a major problem but it might get a bit draughty inside and certainly no high altitude flying'

aS' Nice review PSP guy!'
p7068
aS'So here it is, the long expected ;-) review of the town plan: I bought it at the Legostore Riem Arcaden last Saturday'
p7069
aS' I paid 149,99 EUR for 1981 pieces'
p7070
aS' This set is separated in 4 parts'
p7071
aS' 1: the Service/Gasstation 2: the cars'
p7072
aS' the petrol pump and the fountain 3: the cinema 4: the town hall The Service Station has a lot of really nice details, like tools for the car repair, or the table with the cashpoint and the foodstation (there?s a croissant, a banana and a apple in this set)'
p7073
aS' One of my favourit parts is the trolley with some tools, you can see it at brickshelf'
p7074
aS' At the second part are only a few pieces and i needed not much time to built the 2 cars, the fountain and the petrol pump'
p7075
aS' There?s something at the truck i don?t understand'
p7076
aS' maybe i did something wrong'
p7077
aS' but'
p7078
aS' the truck has no backlights'
p7079
aS' *wacko* I like the petrol pump, that?s why i post a pic of it: The cinema is the highlight for me'
p7080
aS' It has also really nice details, like the popcorn table or the gumball or candy machine'
p7081
aS' The colours sheme is really nice, the front of the building with the big displays is a cool idea'
p7082
aS' Overall a really nice building'
p7083
aS' The town hall has also a really nice colour sheme, i love that dark green mixed with the white stairs'
p7084
aS' A lot of plants around and in the town hall'
p7085
aS' As you can see some figs who married there'
p7086
aS' Not more to say about this building'
p7087
aS' See the pics and enjoy it: Overall this set is a must have!! It was really fun to built it'
p7088
aS' This set reminds me of the Back to the Future movie with Michael J'
p7089
aS' Fox'

aS' I really like how you compared the look to "Back to the Future"'
p7099
aS' When I saw the first pics, I thought the same thing'
p7100
aS" The look of the set is definitly the 1950's"

aS' The Market Street is no "must have" in my opinion'
p7177
aS' But the other two'
p7178
aS' Maybe you should start with the Coffee Corner, it?s the older set'
p7179
aS' The Town Plan is newer and will be available longer then the Coffee Corner'
p7180

If you\'re not happy with Sandra\'s work, do provide one yourself instead of bitching on how YOU view a review and on how Sandra\'s post is veryt far from one (according to you !!) Wow, I have not been called a "youg man" (by which I assume you mean "young") for a while'
p7183
aS" As a forty year old with three kids that's unusual"
p7184

aS'REVIEW'
p7187
aS'EVER" tone that was creeping in amongst the replys, that it needed to be tempered with some thoughtful suggestions as to how a good review could be made great'
p7188
aS' Your ad hominem approach is offensive and far more negative than I was and to suggest I should do my own review is ridiculous'
p7189
aS' I live in Canada and we do not even have the set available here yet thus I am interested in seeing reviews of this set'
p7190
aS' If I already had the set I would not be so interested'
p7191
aS' And next time you propose to critique a critique perhaps you should actually read what I wrote'
p7192
aS' I said she wrote a good review for a specific audience'
p7193
aS' I did NOT say it was awful or whatever you seem to have assumed I meant'
p7194
aS' Saying something is good but could be improved can hardly be characterized as "bitching"'
p7195
aS'Thanks for the review'
p7196
aS' I really want this set because: 1'
p7197
aS' It looks fantastic 2'
p7198
aS' Has harder to find colors 3'
p7199
aS' Is a 50th anniversary commemorative 4'
p7200
aS' Some of the models are based on the 50s sets (i love the old stuff) The tanker truck is a perfect recreation of the old HO 1:87 scale Esso Tanker Truck'
p7201
aS' I have one, and you can look at it for comparison if you would like'
p7202
aS" Lego HO vehicles I'd like to modify the truck from this new set to look even more like the old Esso truck, getting rid of the green and adding some decals"
p7203
aS'Happy New Year, everyone! I went to my local Wal-mart looking for an exclusive Bionicle set yesterday, but was amazed to find everything there- SW, Bionicle, EF, Indie, the works'
p7204
aS' I nabbed the JSF and the Rogue Shadow and scampered home to take pics with my new camera'
p7205
aS" *wub* The box: The same as the other '07 boxes"
p7206
aS' Nothing new'
p7207
aS' The back shows the various features, with "pop out R2'
p7208
aS'" :-| Luckily, the intruction booklet and the DSS were intact- not folded like the last MM set I got'
p7209
aS' |-/ The DSS: Not too bad, but printed parts would have been great'
p7210
aS' The figs'
p7211
aS' Anakin is amazing, IMO'
p7212
aS' *wub* Fits the CW Anie great'
p7213
aS' I noticed on the S@H reviews the kiddies were saying how ugly he looked'
p7214
aS' |-/ They need to see the CW cartoon'
p7215
aS' For the sake of my health, I should probably stop reading those'
p7216
aS' :-D The build'
p7217
aS" I won't go too in-depth on the build, since *vader* posted a very in-depth review here"
p7218
aS' The start of the build: The body of the fighter starts out long and skinny'
p7219
aS" The JSF's landing gear allows it to sit comfortably without getting in the way while swooshing"
p7220
aS" R2-D2's launching device"
p7221
aS' R2 in position'
p7222
aS' When launched'
p7223
aS"He often gets stuck if you don't press the button hard enough"
p7224
aS' :-/ Looks like R2 needs to lay off'
p7225
aS' whatever it is robots eat'
p7226
aS' So far: The flag stickered'
p7227
aS" It's a big sucker sticker"
p7228
aS' Completed'
p7229
aS' I forgot to add the nose stickers before I took the pic'
p7230
aS' Warning- the nose cone sticker is actually two stickers'
p7231
aS" I thought it was one, peeled of one of the stickers, and put it on the middle of the two 1x8 plates, and didn't notice the other sticker"
p7232
aS' *wacko* Various completed shots: I think this was a beautiful little set'
p7233
aS" R2's launching unit and the flick missiles are annoying, but easily fixed"
p7234
aS' I plan to add proper cannons in place of the flick missiles'
p7235
aS" Anakin is a great minifig, but he doesn't look so well standing next to my other figs"
p7236
aS' The Brickshelf Gallery (when public) Will'
p7237
aS"Tks Will for your great review !! G after reading *vader* 's reviews (of that set and the RS) and yours I really can't wait to get that set and all of the SW sets :-P Really nice photography there which is sweet !! *yoda*"

p7239
aS'Thanks for the review, Mr'
p7240
aS" Mandalorian! This set looks very nice, and it's good to know the nose cone stickers are 2 separate ones, so they don't cross bricks"
p7241
aS" :-D That camera is working out great for ya'! Thanks again! ~Peace"
p7242
aS'Thanks for the reveiw on this great set! I actually just came home from TRU with this, maybe 1/2 hour ago! Funny! Love the new hair sculpt! *wub*'

p7256
aS" I don't know if I buy this set now I know there's also a Anakin in the AT-TE with a new jedi, but who knows"
p7257
aS"Wow, I'm surprised no one had done this already"
p7258
aS" First off, this is a truly lovely set that many people should own, even though it's SOLD OUT on the S@H :'-( "
p7259
aS' now lets start off with an overview'
p7260
aS' *Note*: I was missing a few of the pieces (the rabbit, the trike) when I toke the pics'
p7261
aS' The figs and a cat'
p7262
aS' The engine: I really love this thing'
p7263
aS" It's a beautiful 0-6-0 steam engine with a tender"
p7264
aS' This is probably the most detailed steam engine Lego has given us'
p7265
aS' I loved it so much, I made a non-holiday version for my town'
p7266
aS' The flat cars: I like these, but they seem a bit simple'
p7267
aS' Their cargo is good for Christmas or a birthday party'
p7268
aS' The passenger car: It resembles the green passenger car we got a while back, but I like the interior in this one a bit better'
p7269
aS' The caboose: a simple caboose like the one from 2001'
p7270
aS" the sad thing about it is thats there is no interior and it's hard to take the roof off"
p7271
aS' Overall: I like this set, but it is kind of hard to use during the non winter months'
p7272
aS' The price is kind of good, but with that price, it should have came with the motor'
p7273
aS' I give it a 9/10 Happy New Year! Edited by AgentRick57, 04 January 2008 - 12:00 AM'
p7274
aS'Darn! If I would have known noone has reviewed this I would have! Thanks! *sweet* *y*'
p7275
aS'Thanks for the review AgentRick57'
p7276
aS' It is a beautiful set, and quite cheap for me; $50 AUD for 965 parts! 8-? Not sure what I will do with the rabbit though; it is huge! :-D (I was considering doing this review myself but Sinnerton is a mess'

p7289
aS'99 on LSAH instead of the usual price of ?50!'

aS'Dang it, I meant to try to get one of these after Christmas '
p7299
aS' I knew they were half-off at S@H and I just forgot'
p7300
aS" Now they're sold out"
p7301
aS' Darn! Thanks for the review!'
p7302
aS"this is a nice set X-O i managed to get 6 of em' before thay sold out :-$"
p7303
aS'Blah'
p7304
aS' I wanted one of these at half off but I forgot and missed out'
p7305
aS' Thanks for the review though :-$'
p7306
aS'I was fortunate enough to get one along with the Hobby Train'
p7307
aS' They are the first trains I have ever owned (mainly by virtue of them having been half price)'
p7308
aS" It's a fantastic selection of parts with the Holiday Train, as well as it really looking the part as a set"
p7309
aS" I'm happy not to get a motor; as I think the 9V setup would prove expensive, and the IR control system for the RC setup seems a bit poor"
p7310
aS' I got some "dead" track for with it to have just as a push train for now'
p7311
aS'Got one for 90 USD, one of the best trains ever'
p7312
aS'Funny as train, perfect for parts'
p7313
aS' What else to say'
p7314
aS' *y*'
p7315
aS'Okie guys and gals, here s time for some droid exploration with my review of set 7670'
p7316
aS' As a general statement I have to say its really a neat set that is not that expensive for what it holds'
p7317
aS' 1) Box art Like always I will start with pics of the box art'
p7318
aS' BTW, notice anything guys ? No bloody crappy DSS'
p7319
aS' Yes, finally a set without stickers and that feels great :-D 2) The Mfs Nothing really spectacular there'
p7320
aS' The only novelty lies within the inclusion of the new Commander (yellow torso) BD'
p7321
aS' Apart from that, there are 2 BDs and unfortunately yet another SBD (I like those but I have a huge amount of them, and I would rather had something different)'
p7322
aS' You have 3 short blasters and a couple of extra parts'
p7323
aS' 3) The Spider Droid I think it?s a pretty cool little buggar'
p7324
aS' It?s a rather simple yet classic construction I think'
p7325
aS' It has sweet parts such as the BD body in dark bley'
p7326
aS' It really has a spider feel unlike the previous Ep3 one'
p7327
aS' 4) The Hailfire Droid This baby represents the ?pi?ce de resistance? of this set'
p7328
aS' I truly love it !! Sure it?s a bit under scale but I don?t really mind that'
p7329
aS' Its conception is superb even if I totally dislike assembling those technic treads (especially 80 of those small things)'
p7330
aS' The ellipse of the treads is well balanced and that trans disc is a brilliant idea'
p7331
aS' The great thing is those new flick fire missiles: they don?t fall unlike the other ones and they do look good on this baby'
p7332
aS' Also you can put the wheels together and the missiles to gain some shelf space (easy storage ON :-D ) In conclusion those druids re really sweet and are perfect target practice for the upcoming RGS hehe !! I hope you enjoyed that review and do not hesitate to comment and ask pic requests if any ;-) *yoda*'

p7353
aS' The new 7670 commander has a torso made of all yellow plastic, whereas the 2000 battle droid commander had a tan torso with yellow printings, and a tan head with yellow printings'

aS' The Hellfire droid is also well put together even if it is a little small, but hey it looks fun'

p7397
aS'Great review, as we\'ve come to expect from *yoda* *y* Nice to see that TLG is finding new and interesting ways to get around the "no minifig only" sets restrictions with Hasbro'
p7398
aS" Clearly, this is another army builder with a minimal vehicle as we're becoming accustomed to"
p7399
aS' Heck, even the diminutive Hailfire is technically a droid as well, thus making this all minifigs, from a certain point of view'
p7400
aS' Only negative: It is a bit overpriced'
p7401
aS" I'll have a better feel for that when I get one"
p7402
aS' Treads/links always drive up a price, so it might just be fair'
p7403
aS' The spiderdroid is a winner, even with the unusual parts assortment'
p7404
aS' I like it when LEGO thinks of different ways to use things, I think it promotes the same from us'
p7405
aS" I'm not sure what I think of the new battledroid commanders, but at least I can make extras easily if I need to, as I bought a bunch of yellow droid bodies off Bricklink once, thinking I might want to make some kind of new droid out of them"
p7406
aS' They were cheap at the time, now I expect the price to go up just because of this potential use'
p7407

aS"i like the set, i like the parts, but it's definitly not worth it's RRP of $45 NZD, if you ask me i should be more like $35 NZD, but hey, i still like it, i got it for $30 on ebay so i'm not complaining *y* *y*"

p7422
aS' 1) Mail Van (7731) Like always I?ll start with shots of the box art and bloody DSS'
p7423
aS' Now here are the extras of that set: I really love the new torso of the postal worker'
p7424
aS' My huge grip lies on the mail box: that mail logo is a freaking sticker !! For that part I was so expecting a printed part'
p7425
aS' That is really really bad !! Apart from that the design is pretty cool'
p7426
aS' The van is quite simple but I think its pretty cute'
p7427
aS' I love the fact that the rear is a window'
p7428
aS' 2) Air Mail (7732) Like always I?ll start with shots of the box art and bloody DSS'
p7429
aS' The extras are OK: another great postal worker'
p7430
aS' You also have yet another red trolley with a package that is a bloody sticker yet again !! G TLC should have more printed parts !! That plane for me is a classic thing of beauty !! Really is consistent with the fantastic planes of the 80?s'
p7431
aS' That?s the kind of lanes TLC should produce instead of those huge Playmo planes'
p7432
aS' Actually I am happy that TLC released that one ? for once its not a bloody airline exclusive promo set !! Here are general pics'
p7433
aS' I love the engines of the plane: simple yet superb'
p7434
aS' Also the top hatch opens to insert mail and packages'
p7435
aS' The front control panel is a printed part !! I love the classic double train windows and here is a poc of the undeneath of the set'
p7436
aS' In conclusion I truly love these small sets: they are the perfect size (4 wide car yeay !!) and the colour pattern is amazing as well'
p7437
aS' I hope you enjoyed that review and do not hesitate to comment and ask pic requests if any ;-) *yoda*'
p7438
aS'Great review Yoda'
p7439
aS' Thanks for sharing'
p7440
aS" I wasn't real fond of the postal truck at first"
p7441
aS" It's so different than those in the US"
p7442
aS' But after seeing your close-up images (esp'
p7443
aS' the back of the tuck), it looks really neat'
p7444
aS' I also like the mail box a lot'
p7445
aS' It looks good in red'
p7446
aS" Too bad for the stickers, but it's still nice"
p7447
aS' The plane reminds me a lot of the design used in the Jurassic Park set'
p7448
aS" As you've said, it's similar to 80s designs"
p7449
aS' I really like the brick-built design too'
p7450
aS" It's just real Lego - that's about all I can say"
p7451
aS' Very nice sets that are a must together'
p7452
aS' Thanks for the review'
p7453
aS'Excellent review'
p7454
aS' You convinced me to buy these two'
p7455
aS" Could you tell me how much you payed for them? I think I'm gonna buy them tomorrow if they have it already (or if I don't see any cooler sets)"
p7456
aS"I haven't spotted these in the US yet"
p7457
aS" I'm looking forward to finding them"
p7458
aS" Overall, the 2008 line-up is a excellent and it's going to be difficult for me to decide which themes/sets to pursue"
p7459
aS" There's a lot to choose from"
p7460
aS'Thanks for the great review *yoda* '
p7461
aS" I'm definitely going to get that plane, I've sadly only owned one of the many Lego planes there is"

p7466
aS' Really? Where do you live?'
p7467
aS'Nice review yoda I dont think I have ever read one with as much cursing of stickers! :-D I love these two little sets, the colour scheme the little different wheels on the post van and of course the new postmen uniforms! Would have been nice if they had included little satchels like in the new indiana jones sets, oh well! ;-) postman Yoda on! *yoda*'
p7468
aS'Thanks for the takes on these two sets, Yoda'
p7469
aS" Stickers or not, I still think these are charming sets with all the essence and nostalgia of the older sets back in the 80/90's"
p7470
aS' Am I the first one to notice the new doors used in the back of the van'
p7471
aS' Not only is it using the popular new frame, but the old container doors have been redesigned to fit with the new frame as well'
p7472
aS" Pity they're not yellow, though"
p7473
aS"Very nice, cheers Yoda! I'll definitely be getting the post van, not sure about the plane though"
p7474
aS' Both are awesome, but I think I have enough planes'
p7475
aS' Can you tell me though, the wheels on the van, are they rubber or plastic? They look a bit tacky'
p7476
aS'these little sets are really nice! they cought my eye the minute i saw them! it would have been SO great if there was a post office to go with them! there are so few buildings in lego city the design is very classic and i am ofcourse considering to get them but it seems that i have a lot of small cars and planes on my desk! :-$ recently i took a flight with Cyprus Airways from Thessaloniki to Cyprus and the two promo plane sets were there! I was so tired though that i couldnt stay awake to buy them! im taking a flight again on Tuesday and i hope they are not out of stock!! thanks for a great review Yoda! a fine job as always! cant wait for your next one'
p7477
aS'Aww man, is TLC really getting too cheap for printed parts? Shame on you TLC!! Despite those stickers these are two really neat sets'
p7478
aS' Especially the airplane'
p7479
aS' Classic *wub* Reminds me of that little plane my dad bought in an airplane'
p7480
aS" Not sure what's the set nr"
p7481
aS' The window at the rear of the van looks like a normal window frame without the clips for the shutters'
p7482
aS' I never knew those existed 8-? Might come handy for ship building'
p7483
aS' Thanks for the review Yoda!'
p7484
aS'Thank you for the nice review Pity of the stickers but the design is nice 80ies on!'
p7485
aS'Great Review *yoda* (I find myself saying that line alot :-D ) I love these two little sets *wub* TLC continues the Great City Line that started in 07 and continues into 08 Its also nice to have other sub lines besides Fire and police :-| :-P I hope there are many more Postal Sets, like a Post office!!That would be sweet! Hope these are Mainstream and not those damn exclusives >:-( Postal ON! P'
p7486
aS"Thanks for the review! I was always going to get these two sets, so you haven't swayed me at all!! X-D I reckon Lego could enhance this sub-theme by releasing a post motorbike (with or without a sidecar) and post office"
p7487
aS' Obviouly the office would be the hub of all the activity, while the post bike would take care of the postal run'
p7488
aS' This would free up the van to take or recieve bulk mail or parcels to or from the airport'
p7489
aS' It could then also do the parcel deliveries around the city'
p7490
aS' The office would also serve as the reciever for all the parcels the new goods truck might deliver'
p7491
aS" Just some thoughts, that's all!! *sweet*"
p7492
aS"I need to do some catching up here :-P Matn, on Jan 5 2008, 05:16 PM, said: Could you tell me how much you payed for them? I think I'm gonna buy them tomorrow if they have it already (or if I don't see any cooler sets)"
p7493
aS" I paid a tad more than the S@H price: I paid 15 for the plane and 8 for the van (sure its a tad more expensive but I didn't want to wait for TRU to get them) Freddie, on Jan 5 2008, 06:10 PM, said: Am I the first one to notice the new doors used in the back of the van"

p7495
aS" Pity they're not yellow, though"
p7496
aS' Great remark there, I guess I totally missed that one :-$ And I agree that yellow doors would have been better but those dark bley do not look that bad !! Mr Hobbles, on Jan 5 2008, 09:10 PM, said: Can you tell me though, the wheels on the van, are they rubber or plastic? They look a bit tacky'
p7497
aS' Rubber off course ;-) They do look a tad tacky but its because they are the thin type (like with the racers) and I am not a fan of those |-/ phoinix, on Jan 5 2008, 09:35 PM, said: cant wait for your next one Tks ;-) Me neither though :-P marvinblue, on Jan 6 2008, 03:31 AM, said: I reckon Lego could enhance this sub-theme by releasing a post motorbike (with or without a sidecar) and post office'

p7502
aS' So true 8-? At one point I was thinking of a impulse set with a yellow bike, postman, post and letters (that would rock !!)'
p7503
aS" I hope TLC adds to this sub theme and keeps that retro feel *wub* A yellow dirtbike with sidecar would be a sweet 5? set !! Also a small town feel post office would be so cool: like a 20/30? set ;-) We can be sure of one thing though, this year's advent calendar will have a postamn and small post office ;-) Post On !! *yoda*"
p7504
aS'Thanks for the review :-) I was actually considering getting these, but I saw they were overpriced for my tastes - too bad, theyre nifty lil things *wub*'
p7505
aS'loool : Spielberg goes on a career change :-D these are some nice sets'
p7506
aS' I really love that car'
p7507
aS' looks sleek'
p7508
aS'Thanks for a nice review and few comments to sets: Nice airplane, finally some reminiscence for Lego City Golden Era (for me years 1982-1992)'
p7509
aS' Everything is nice, but two things are freezing a smile on my face'
p7510
aS' First of all the ugly new hinge used for plane roof'
p7511
aS' I have already 4032 and those new hinges are looking really terrible when compared f'
p7512
ag3111
aS' with 6368'
p7513
aS' Second one is new minifig, I don?t know what I expected, but this torso design looks too simple and too cheap'
p7514
aS' Concerning new car - I appreciate fact, that TLC makes after long long years again Postal sets, but I don?t like those new-style cars'
p7515
aS' Matchbox wheels and bad rate between drivers cockpit and cargo space are damping me from buying'
p7516
aS' 6651 Mail Truck or 105 Canada Post Truck were much better'
p7517
aS' Edited by Kanal-K1, 06 January 2008 - 07:33 PM'
p7518
aS"While the plane does look nice, I don't particularly care for the van"
p7519
aS' But the van does have some good parts, which is the only reason I would by one: yellow mud guards, the new windshield, and the small door on the rear'
p7520
aS'Well first off, thanks yoda for the great review'
p7521
aS' :-) Hmmm'
p7522
aS" Well, i have to say, i'm not at all impressed with any of these sets"
p7523
aS' I mean, there nice and all, but the van just seems way to small'
p7524
aS' It would have been nice if you could fit more than one package in it'
p7525
aS" I guessi'm one of those that are more of the fan of the 6 wide trucks"
p7526
aS' And the plane'
p7527
aS' Hm'
p7528
aS' this has a "cute" factor and all, but i mean com\'on'
p7529
aS' You have to open a hatch on the roof to get your packages in?? And what about getting them out? You have to flip the plane upside down? :-| Weak'
p7530
aS' They should have had a hinged rear end or a hatch on the side'
p7531

p7535

p7536
aS' Yes, this is the LEGO charming! No stairs in buildings, cars with just one minifig, all those things that make LEGO what it is'
p7537
aS" Thanks Yoda for your review! Those posts sets will be mine, but I will wait to find them in my supermarket, even if I have to wait 2 or 3 months, I know that I will save some money, so I will buy more LEGO :-D There are simple designed sets, but we don't need more: two nice litle sets that are not oversized and too expensive"

aS"TheBrickster, on Jan 5 2008, 10:12 AM, said: I wasn't real fond of the postal truck at first"
p7539
aS" It's so different than those in the US"
p7540
aS' good point B'
p7541
aS' this design is just too foreign to my eyes for me to enjoy'
p7542
aS" i don't like either of these sets, very disapointing - the postal theme has so much potential"
p7543
aS" i don't really like the torsos either - too plain/cheap as kanal suggested"
p7544
aS' and i will agree that the wheels on the van look cheap'
p7545
aS' i was sooooo impressed with city 2007, this is a real let down'
p7546
aS' though, i am happy to see a small set with a postal box'
p7547
aS" so, even though, all that aside, i'll probably buy 6 of the van - just for the yellow mudgards, postal box and stickers to populate my city"
p7548
aS' and i think this set will provide some excellent piece to MOC a yellow civillian convertable with *sweet* - BM'
p7549
aS"I'm glad to see the mail van has the doors that used to be on the older cargo containers"
p7550
aS" I had given up on those older ones, but now that they're still out there, I may invest in the older cargo system instead of the new 6-wide ones"
p7551
aS" Both sets are good enough, I'll get both"
p7552
aS" I'm hoping for a postal building too, even though I have the smaller of the old post offices"
p7553
aS' A nice big modern one would be great'
p7554
aS" I'm not too hung up about the design of the plane; I've got the neat old cargo plane with the tail that swings open (one of the best plane sets) for big packages"
p7555
aS' The truck is goofy looking, but if I get sick of looking at it I can rebuild it into a classic looking one'
p7556
aS" Great review by the way, the pictures are some of the better one I've seen in a review recently"

p7563
aS' I see your point that more cargo capacity would have been better'
p7564
aS' Nevertheless, my personal preference is for smaller "classic" scale City sets'
p7565
aS' The mail van is nice and small, and should fit well with my road plates and 1990s cars from the 4561 train'
p7566
aS' On a side note, did anyone notice the message on the back of both sets\' boxes, "designed for easy building and instant play"? It surprised me a little, since these sets seem no less complex than any other City set of late'
p7567
aS' They look like quick builds, sure, but not as though the designers went out of their way to simplify them'
p7568
aS'Thanks *yoda* for the great reviews'
p7569
aS" I love the airplane, it's really cute"
p7570
aS' The van needed to grow on me though but you did the trick'

p7579

p7580
aS" *sweet* I'd like to say sorry about my photos, they were taken quickly"
p7581
aS" first, we have the box: it is the smallest lego box I've ever seen, and actually looks cute *wub* it will be heavy competition with playmobil's specials"
p7582

p7583

p7584
aS' the firefighter has a small fire to extinquish, armed with an axe, chainsaw, other saw and foam'
p7585
aS' psssh thing X-D '
p7586
aS' five extra parts in a 30 part set! we get an extra black hatchet, yellow bar tap, light bley 1*1 plate, red 1*1 plate modified with fingers and 2*2 dark bley radar dish'
p7587
aS" Besides the plate, I've never seen these as reserve parts"
p7588
aS' but I\'m not complaining X-D here is a small "alternate" model I created with it: a small bbq'
p7589
aS" what? He's hungry and he needs to put something on the bbq >:-) X-D Overall, you can't go wrong with these Impulse sets"
p7590
aS' I paid 2'
p7591
aS'89 euros for this little set, so thats a great value! Sadly the only impulse avaible were these 3 city sets (no police) and the alien Mars mission'
p7592
aS' Looking forward to the knight and magician as well as those Indy sets! TT'
p7593
aS"Cool! Finally its an entire line I can actually afford to own every set! :-D I can't wait to get my hands on them! If its possible, could you give us the demensions of the box? It would be apprectiated"

p7607
aS'95 from Target Build time 90 minutes Yet another interesting Creator theme house'
p7608
aS' This one comes fresh of the 2008 line of sets and promises 3 different models'
p7609
aS' Packing 522 pieces (albeit a lot of 1x1 plates) for only $29'
p7610
aS'95 it was hard to pass this one by as I was foraging for the new 2008 Star Wars sets at the local Target'
p7611
aS' Plus, I was itching to do another review since I had finally fully recovered from my marathon UCS Falcon review which took the better part a month to complete'
p7612
aS' The Box: The box is pretty standard Creator type box which shows off the three models (beach house, Caf? and ?towering? apartment building'
p7613
aS') The back of the box shows some of the features of the three models'
p7614
aS' Interesting features of the three models prominently displayed on the back include: - Food counter complete with coffee (espresso) maker and food warmer (with chicken leg!) - Home office complete with laptop (and the ubiquitous coffee cup'
p7615
aS') - Flip up roof granting access inside of beach house'
p7616
aS' Note the satellite TV dish and even rain gutters along the roofline! Opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals'
p7617
aS' We?re back to the reusable cereal box type tab system that we saw so often in 2007 sets'
p7618
aS' Note the parts inventory is on the side of the box as well'
p7619
aS' This is a nice feature'
p7620
aS' Once inside the box, we are greeted by eight sealed bags plus two yellow 16x2 plates and a green 32x16 baseplate'
p7621
aS' Thank goodness there is no DSS (dreaded sticker sheet) but alas there are no minifigs'
p7622
aS' In addition, there are the three manuals (one for each model) and they were stuffed into my box with the care of kid trying to put 10 gallons (or liters if you prefer) of candy in a 5 gallon bucket'
p7623
aS' But hey, we?re not collecting manuals here so who cares if the manuals are all bent and warped? The Manuals: The three manuals are 74, 72 and 48 pages in length'
p7624
aS' They are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings: - Piece call outs for each step - Parts inventory at the end of the primary model build - Page numbers Color separation in these manuals were fine for me'
p7625
aS' Plus, we get the usual verbose LEGO instructions on not dumping all your pieces outside in the grass and not to dump all your pieces into a single pile'
p7626
aS' Thanks for the tip, TLG! Parts list The Pieces: Pretty standard stuff here and as I mentioned, lots of 1x1 plates and tiles (at least 100'
p7627
aS') However, we do get quite a few windows and a couple of doors'
p7628
aS' A majority of the color is black and yellow'
p7629
aS' I did see a few pieces that I was not familiar with so I?m going to show them below'
p7630
aS' Keep in mind I?m not a parts jockey so bear with me if I think a part is brand new for 2008 and it was actually released with the classic space line'
p7631
aS' 2x2 Window (fixed) and 4x3 window that opens: The follow photo shows the window glass (same as in Corner Caf?), door glass and new black parts'
p7632
aS' Turns out these black parts are used as wheels'
p7633
aS' I showed the window glass because it still contains the molding circle just like they did before'
p7634
aS' It is hard to see from the photo, but it is there'
p7635
aS' The door glass I think might be new: I don?t recall seeing these 2x2 round plates with clips before and I thought I would show the mail only because it is printed and not a sticker: I know these are common, but didn?t they have four studs on top? These only have two: How about this sloped 4x3 window that opens: Overall a nice assortment of parts with nothing juniorized'
p7636
aS' The Build: The build was fun and was fairly straightforward'
p7637
aS' Once you figure out which of the three models to build, it goes pretty quick'
p7638
aS' Here are a few shots: See how the inside is made: Look at the detail with the flowers and even the outside water faucet! Outdoor seating area: Upstairs being built: Upstairs with opening roof (notice the satellite TV dish): Check out the patio on the upstairs complete with outdoor light and rain gutters! Here?s my favorite, the BBQ grill'
p7639
aS' At least we know where those new parts go: Finally, check out the tree'
p7640
aS' No juniorization here! Here is what is left over: So far, I have only built the primary model'
p7641
aS' The others look interesting, especially the caf?'
p7642
aS' The Design: The design was well done'
p7643
aS' Very rich in detail'
p7644
aS' I love how there are no juniorized parts'
p7645
aS' The house is accessible by taking off the top floor (like Caf? Corner and Market Street)'
p7646
aS' There is an internal staircase as well'
p7647
aS' There is no interior to speak of in the beach house, but there is in the other two models'
p7648
aS' The only real negative is that it is kind of small when you get it done'
p7649
aS' It would be nice if it was about 50% bigger'
p7650
aS' Here are a few views of the beach house with a few minifigs thrown in: Check out the close-up of the caf? which I think looks great: Also, here is a photo of the interior of the apartment building where you can see the office and computer: Overall Thoughts: It is a really nice set'

aS'Love this set now more than ever'
p7674
aS' *wub* I knew I wanted it from the first leaked boxshots, especially with my love of yellow buildings (just ask Hinckley ;-) )'
p7675
aS' Great review, especially nice to see the closeup parts shots'
p7676
aS" Those new 2x2 white windows are very much like replacements for the classic 2x2 windows TLG stopped regularly making a while back, so it's great to see them"
p7677
aS' The wheels are trolley wheels, common in sets including stretchers and handcarts'
p7678
aS' The holder for them is a fairly recent part I think'
p7679
aS' I remember a couple coming in a little single minifig jet engine repair set I picked up in a S@H order within the last year'

aS' Keep in mind I?m not a parts jockey so bear with me if I think a part is brand new for 2008 and it was actually released with the classic space line'
p7702
aS' I know these are common, but didn?t they have four studs on top? These only have two: How about this sloped 4x3 window that opens: As for the fence: I know only the 2-stud version'
p7703
aS' 8-| And the window was used a lot in the 80s and 90s (even in the 2004 city airport)'
p7704
aS' Don?t worry, I?m not complaining'
p7705
aS' It just came to my mind, because today I rebuild my 7866 (from 1983), which had 2 of these babys'
p7706
aS'Thanks for this great review! I love this awesome set, the Creator line never disappoints'

aS"Thanks for the review Dunamis, this is a great little set! I'm also very impressed with Takuto20's mods"
p7745
aS" I've been trying a few of my own"
p7746
aS' I liked the tower block design, but a lot of stuff needed fixing'
p7747
aS' Firstly I added a 4th wall, and made it so the storeys could be lifted off like in the other models'
p7748
aS' I also added flowers on the windowsills and doorways out on to the balconies'
p7749
aS" Still to be added is an extra door for the top floor which I'm going to get from the new doors and windows pack"
p7750
aS' I added a chimney that goes all the way up the back of the house, and has a fireplace on every level'
p7751
aS' Each floor is fully furnished with a fireplace, wash basin and bed on the upper levels'
p7752
aS'and a corner sofa and coffee table, plus an extra large fireplace on the ground floor'
p7753
aS' Finally here is my idea of what to do with two copies of this set! All the parts pictured are from 2x 4996, except 5 extra fence panels and the minifigs'
p7754
aS" The house on the left has it's garden at the rear"
p7755
aS'1'
p7756
aS' BEFORE BUYING Even if I am City fan, those new sized planes are really not mine cup of tea, my love to Lego is firmly frozen somewhere between years 1980-1995'
p7757
aS' Main reason to buy was, that I wanted to write a review at Czech Afol web Kostky'
p7758
aS'org'
p7759
aS' I bought it three days ago via web advertising, price was +- 35 USD'
p7760
aS' 2'
p7761
aS' AFTER OPENING THE BOX As presumed, some very big parts and three bags, and as an additional bonus lot of Danish air free of charge'
p7762
aS' First sight told me, that this will be really short and easy building'
p7763
aS' 3'
p7764
aS' IMPRESSIONS DURING BUILDING '
p7765
aS'and it was really true'
p7766
aS' 30 minutes of lazy building'
p7767
aS' Bag 1 - plane'
p7768
aS' Bag 2 - plane gondols with supports'
p7769
aS' Bag 3 - wings and propellers'
p7770
aS' When I saw the way, how is this plane made, I was strongly thinking to play Money for Nothing from Dire Straits as a music accordant with whole set'
p7771
aS' 4'
p7772
aS' IMPRESSIONS AFTER BUILDING - LOOKOUT Juniorized creeps'
p7773
aS' This is my first plane in this scale and for 99% the last one'
p7774
aS' Lack of details, lot of ugly big parts, from whole set you can see the main development target - to keep RRP at some certain low level'
p7775
aS' Inner space of airplane absolutely undone, no details, no luggage, no computers, nothing at all!! Just a lot, lot of air! The very only details in whole plane are the stickered pilots desk and some kind of seat constuction'
p7776
aS' 5'
p7777
aS' IMPRESSIONS AFTER BUILDING - PLAYABILITY But, what is playability at this set? Hydroplane, which cannot float (as seen on enclosed photos) ? If TLC will make some new kind of big parts used for gondolas, to make the plane floating, they will for sure make no other damage'
p7778
aS' Juniorization couldn?t be higher'
p7779
aS' You even cannot drive across the carpet with the plane'
p7780
aS' So, how to play? Open the doors, open the cabin part, and turn with propellers? Weak, Weak, Weak! 6'
p7781
aS' RESUMED IMPRESSIONS Sadly I must say, that at limited release sets TLC? boat seems to sailing to the worst part of the coast'
p7782
aS' After quite good 7344, perfect 7899 and 7900, strange, but acceptable 7998, juniorization came back with 7906, followed with this ugly Playmobilized 7732'
p7783
aS' 7'
p7784
aS' FINAL WORD In fact, even 15 USD seems to be too much for this kind of set'
p7785
aS' 35 USD, expected RRP in our country, is really overpriced to hell'
p7786
aS' Neither set, nor minifig is not interesting'
p7787
aS' TLC maybe knows about juniorization as well, as nowhere on the box the number of pieces isn?t written'
p7788
aS' If you my AFOL friends want to spent your bucks, better give half of the price to African orphans'
p7789

aS'Am I the only that one that thinks it is not SO BAD???????????????????????What I am trying to say is wouldn\'t planes be this big in real life???I know it has a lot of big pieces but how would they make them any smaller,or how would they the big pieces into a bunch of tiny pieces?well any way I do think in some cases that if there is any "juniorized" involved it should be with duplo'

p7827
aS' And at last, you should have notice that that the first submarine with a wing made of several plates It is said that this set has more than 200 parts'
p7828
aS" Hide and seek ! X-D You may have lost several bags I'm eager that people buy this set a lot : I'd like to buy a lot of these new white 4x4x2 curved slope for my MOCs"

aS'i have to agree with almost all of the replies here that This set is the most ugliest looking Lego Set I have ever seen'
p7854
aS" If I have never seen this set, and ppl showed it to me, I would have thought it would be some little kid's MOC or something (no offence!) Huge juniorized pieces, bad color theme (i would say it would look better if the wing is white), no interior and huge DSS! I will avoid this set like the plague"

aS'Hello and welcome to another Redman set review! Well, actually, the first Redman set review! I\'m your host, Redman, and today I adorn my medieval outfit to tell you about the Impulse set simply titled "The Knight"'
p7877
aS' This is a great set, with 14 pieces, 2 of which are spare, and a minifig with 2 weapons, 2 helmets, and some shiny armour'
p7878
aS' All this is packaged in a tiny box, just short of 10 cm? (or 3? inches?), with a neat little instruction manual that folds up to the size of the weapons rack included in the set'
p7879
aS' As you can see, this set only costs a measly 7 NZD'
p7880
aS' (Disclaimer: Redman not included'
p7881
aS') Here we see the box, clearly showing what the box holds'
p7882
aS' On the top we see a 1:1 scale picture of a minifig, for those new to Lego, or who have forgotten how big a minifig is I guess'
p7883
aS' :-/ X-D The instruction manual, showing the nice and easy built, with me for size comparison'
p7884
aS' :-D (*Sorry about the dark image, I had to lean over the light to get a birds eye pic'
p7885
aS' ;-)*) Here we see the 2 different soldiers you can make with the set; a knight, and a guard or standard troop or soldier or whatever you want to call him'
p7886
aS' (Note, each set comes with only 1 minifigure, and additional accessories'
p7887
aS") Of course you know I'm in the picture just for the sake of it, I'm not really one of the soldiers"
p7888
aS' X-D The neat little weapons rack, or rather equipment rack, as it holds not only a weapon but a shield (except the ovoid ones), helmet, and armour'
p7889
aS" Nice and easy storage, so your equipment won't get dirty lying around on the ground"
p7890
aS' :-D One of the spare parts is another of those robot hands, so you can stick that in place of the shield and allow the rack to hold 2 weapons'
p7891
aS" Just thought you'd like to know that"
p7892
aS' :-$ And here we see the nifty little structure of the thing'
p7893
aS' It can even support a whole minifig! Note the grey stud on the bottom bar is a spare part, I just find it better used there to hold the armour'
p7894

p7913
aS'very good reviews, i think that redman is really ok, a very little cute curious fig'
p7914
aS' sadly he is not in the impulse set'
p7915
aS' ;-) I wish to see redman still around about your creepy avatar, yes, it look a bit creepy *skull* nausicaakro (this impulse set is storage in 8 copies, with 8 wizard set, 16 city set (2x), 16 mission to mars set'

p7920
aS' Both dark grey 1x1 round plates are used on the weapons rack (one for the armour, one for the helmet) and I only got one robot hand for holding weapons'
p7921
aS"Thanks everyone for your positive feedback, it's really appreciated! :-D You'd be surprised how long that 'Redman Presents' thing up the top took me to make! X-D So, it appears people do like Redman, expect him to be reviewing The Good Wizard and Battle Arachnoid in near future! (I know those have already been reviewed, but New Zealand never gets sets first, so I'll just be reviewing the sets I get"

p7930
aS"Thanks, AgentRick! Actually Redman's based on the wrestling costume version of Spider-man, as seen in this set"
p7931
aS' *sweet* ~Peace'
p7932
aS'I would have purchased a few of these except for the fact that I do not like the new torso that they use'
p7933
aS'Well today i finally got my hands on set 7038, now since the moment i first saw pics of this set i knew it was for me'
p7934
aS' So lets start with the new troll helmet and torso, these are both great'
p7935
aS" This troll really stands out as a leader when next to the usual trolls in the dwarf mining set: Ok so here's a few shots of the front of the set: Now one thing i really like about this set is the way that lego have placed the back wheels higher than the front"
p7936
aS' This allows the set to really appear to being pulled: Here we have a shot at the missiles on the wagon, these are better than some around i have to say'
p7937
aS" If you look just behind the bottom missile you will see a simple firing device, simply push it down and then let it go to see those missiles fire: The troll flag is moved behind the missiles for firing: One thing that does bother me about this set is the lack of anything on the rear, ok it's easy to fix with a little moc'ing so it's not the end of the world but i would of liked something placed there: Now lets move on to the Crownie's wagon, this is simple yet good for holding weapons: As for the Crown knights themselves, well there the ones from the impulse sets which is great IMO: Here's a few quick shots of the 2 larger trolls we have so far, i prefer the sand green one"
p7938
aS" What about you? Well that's the end for now, requests for pics and comments are welcome"
p7939
aS" Overall i rate this set as a must for anyone who's a fantasy castle fan, i know i'll be getting more of this set"
p7940
aS" As for the new wagon well it's joined up with the other trolls: I do hope the impules crownies i bought today can handle them, oh and yes i did change the knights heads X-D : Fantasy war on!! *vader*"
p7941
aS'Awesome review!! I like the turkey leg hanging in front of the troll X-D Yea the back looks a little'
p7942
aS'Empty 8-| Well Overall I enjoyed the review! See ya soon!'
p7943
aS'seems like a good set should i get it? BTW how did you get you hands on this?'
p7944

p7945
aS" I had to get this set through Shop @ Home, took ages to get here i'm sorry to say"
p7946
aS"Looks like an ace set :-$ I may get this just for the sand green troll, even if I'm not a great castle fan, I do want one of them things! *wub* I also love the goblin's new metal flaked helmet, and the same style with the wheels"
p7947
aS' They look very nice'
p7948
aS' The chicken leg fishing pole is always fun too :-$'
p7949
aS'Nice review'
p7950
aS" *sweet* This is a must buy for me since I *wub* the new sand green giant troll! Now I just have to wait until it's available in the US :'-( General Tarful"
p7951
aS'Thanks for this excellent review Vader! It seems you are succumbing to the Castle side of the force'
p7952
aS' I love the new helmet, and the new Orc torso is fantastic as well, which is great to see that the Troll Faction has many ranks too'
p7953
aS' The Troll himself I love, I agree with you in saying I prefer the sand green version'
p7954
aS' The battle wagon is cool, one of the better wagon designs, and the flag is a great touch which improves it'
p7955
aS" Sadly the back is rather empty, but a few mods'll change that :-) And of course this set includes the infamous chicken pole! One pic request, if you have time Vader, could you please post a few pics of the new helmet on its own, and on a human soldier please? Batbrick is Back! >:-)"
p7956
aS"Thanks for the review *vader*! The first picture of the troll is great, the gold armour really shines! X-D A fantastic set, I'll definitely get a couple of these! *wub* As for the Ogres/'giant trolls', the dark tan one fits in the mine setting well, but for above ground, settings, I prefer the sand green one"

p7965
aS" Batbrick is Back! >:-) Yeah it's alot better than the other one, i'll have to buy some extra ones now just to replace the old ones |-/ Still let's hope the new impulse set has the new version *y*"
p7966
aS"This is fantastic, I love the new helmets for the goblins *sweet* I've always loved the chicken leg thing, really screams LEGO to me! At least how LEGO used to be :'-( Great little bit The goblins are awesome too, and the sand green one should look good next to the tan ones"
p7967
aS'gives a nice feeling of a real species'
p7968
aS" In reality not all members of a species are identical, it's great seeing them in different colors"
p7969
aS' Great review X-D'
p7970
aS'Those extra helmet pictures just seal how much I love those new helmets *wub* They look so great'
p7971
aS'Thank you for the review, vader! That set looks worth buying! 8-? i think you gave me a good reason to buy it'
p7972
aS"Great review, Vader :-) As I've said before, this is a nice set, but doesn't really come with anything that doesn't come with the other sets of the line"
p7973
aS' For this reason, it will be somewhere at the bottom of my list for 2008'
p7974
aS' Also, I like torso and helmet of the Dwarf Mining orcs much better'
p7975
aS' The colours make the torso look rather dull and boring, while the other, more brown one, looks much clearer and more exciting'
p7976
aS" I think I like the *knight* helmet better too, looks more covering and threatening than this one, although I'll save my judgement until I have one in my hands"
p7977
aS' Thanks again Vader ;-) EDIT: Forgot to mention, hilarious pic in your sig, Vader :-D Edited by TinyPiesRUs, 19 January 2008 - 08:28 AM'

aS'Lego City Truck & Forklift Set # 7733 Pieces: 343 Price: $24'
p8021
aS"99 (USD) Store of Purchase: Toys R'Us Release Date: January 2008 After discussion of the mysterious yellow cargo contained in this new City transport set and a visit to my local TRU, I purchased this set"
p8022
aS' I was immediately pleased with the price/piece which I think is pretty reasonable (343 pieces for $25)'
p8023
aS' Starting with the box, great City artwork boasting "Special Edition": Tha backside of the box (no alternate models comes as no surprise): The dreaded decals (I was looking for the skull and bones for radioactive, but no such luck): My favorite part of the set, a very clever forklift: Side view: And the backside: What I like about the forklift is the bars across the top giving the vehicle a "real-life" design'
p8024
aS" The double wheels in the front with two pieces that can hold the wheels also adds to a clever design: I like the figs (although not much new - perhaps I'll make the driver into a werewolf later): The set includes three cargo pallets, the first some sort of fuel with gauge: The 2nd, two Indy containers, and a square 2x4 brick (I have not put the decals on yet): And the mysterious yellow cargo"
p8025
aS' Your guess is as good as mine :-$ '
p8026
aS' On to the truck, the front section: The front grill: Another angle: The back: I like the opening mechanism that is very simple, but works well'
p8027
aS' Also is the large plate tile piece inside'
p8028
aS' I like this because the entire interior has no studs: And the trailer section of the truck: Orange and yellow tail lights: And the rear trailer open: The complete set: Summary: This is a neat set that reminds me a bit of classic Lego City (but larger)'
p8029
aS' It is very playable and has a lot of accessories adding to the value'
p8030
aS' The build was very simple, and enjoyable (took me about an hour)'
p8031
aS' It is a great addition to a number of City sets including the Cargo Ship, Container Stacker, the World City Cargo Train, and the new Cargo Plane'
p8032
aS" As I mentioned previously, I have not yet put on the decals that I'm sure will really add to the overall look of the set"
p8033
aS' The forklift is awesome and I like the cargo containers'
p8034
aS' The truck could have benefited from a few additional details (chrome smokers, and an undercarriage box that really opens)'
p8035
aS' Considering everything, I would buy this set again'
p8036
aS' Hope you enjoy and perhaps this mysterious cargo will make its way into a Brickster Mystery'

aS" - 30 stickers! It's the Exo-Force of City sets! The truck set does look less plain with them on though"
p8095
aS" I would reccomend lining them up with the green brick in the second container rather than applying the first lot without a guide or they may end up uneven - It's very hard to put the minifig in the forklift without dismantling (or breaking open) the set slightly - The cargo box attached to the main cabin of the truck doesn't hold very strongly - Minifigs are dull - that dark blue torso with pattern is way overused - green stickers are a different green to the bricks themselves PROS: - lots of nice pieces including the large white panels and cargo pieces, and i like the green/ white colour scheme - the cargo doors open well and the hingeing mechanism doesn't stand out to the detriment of the rest of the set (as some people have complained about the mail airplane) - studless floor in cargo containers makes it easy to move pallets in and out - fits in better than the Heavy Hauler to a minifig sized city - new 1x1x4 slope! (at least I hadn't seen it before) OVERALL - nice set with some good pictures, although a bit flimsy, and way too many stickers - the same issues I have with the Cargo Plane as well (although that had more colour issues)"
p8096
aS'hey, thanks for the review The Brickster! i was just wondering if you could possibly upload a picture of the instructions for the forklift, and, if possible, tell me the piece # of the 1x4 slope bricks (to bricklink them)'
p8097
aS' thanks!'

aS'Greetings, and welcome to another Redman Review! I\'m your host, Redman, and today I adorn my medieval outfit to tell you about the Impulse set simply titled "The Knight"'
p8105
aS" No wait, that's the old script"
p8106
aS' X-D I mean, "The Good Wizard"'
p8107
aS" *sweet* The other Castle Impulse set (the first being 'The Knight'), this is a wonderful, and in my case unexpected addition to the Castle line! I did not expect to get a nice good wizard, but rather another plain white skellie for the Impulse, and was pleasantly surprised when I saw the first picture of this set"
p8108
aS" The Impulse sets give you pieces you wouldn't expect to see in such small sets, for example, The Knight came with the armour, and this comes with an owl, a gem, and a crystal ball piece"
p8109
aS" It comes with 11 pieces, including the wand, owl, and gem, and no spares, which doesn't really matter as it doesn't need any"
p8110
aS' The box sports the set number, age range (which I blissfully ignore X-D), awesome Castle logo, and the assembled set, with the usual 1:1 scale picture of a minifig'
p8111
aS" The back of the box shows pictures of the boxed Skeleton Tower and King's Castle Siege sets"
p8112
aS' Note the price is in New Zealand dollars, and is really the same prica as any other Impulse set'
p8113
aS' Next are the instructions, which are separated into 3 parts, 1 for the minifigure, 1 for the table, and one for the bird stand'
p8114
aS' Very simple, also worth mentioning is the parts numbers are next to their respective parts, for replacement parts etc'
p8115
aS" On the back we see (on the top half) pictures of Skeleton Prison Carriage, Skeleton Tower, and King's Castle Siege, this time not of the boxed sets, but the sets themselves"
p8116
aS' On the lower half we have 8 pictures, each of the different Impulse sets'
p8117
aS" The Wizard's torso is plain sand blue, with no patterns or anything, but it doesn't really matter is his beard's in the way"
p8118
aS" ;-) The head is that same old 'white fade to grey beard' head, but the white beard covers up most of the grey"
p8119
aS" My favourite part is the pants, I love that we're getting printed belts and legs again"
p8120
aS" His belt has 4 gold crosses (as seen in, if you look closely, the new Crownie's torso and the Crownie archer's torso) and a belt buckle, and the legs have a bottle, a coin, and a small bag"
p8121
aS' Nice little wizard-ey items'
p8122
aS' The, er, items, no, accessories, no, models? The stuff in the set include a little stand for the owl, and a table utilising the new 4x4 round piece in light bley, with the crystal ball in the middle, encasing the yellow gem held on by a 2x2 circle piece in blue'
p8123
aS" Why blue, I'm not sure"
p8124
aS" Maybe it's because the crystal is yellow, and the Crownie's colours are blue and gold, so the blue piece with the yellow crystal symbolise the Crownie's colours"
p8125
aS' Or maybe TLC just felt the need to include an odd colour'
p8126
aS" :-P In conclusion, this is a wonderful set, with some neat accessories, and it doesn't really need to be bought in the masses, after all, you needs an army of owls and wizards? :-| :-P So it works fine as a single set, and adds a more fantasy feel to your Crownie army"
p8127
aS" That's all for today folks! *sweet* [/Redman] Thanks for reading another of my Redman interviews, any suggestions on how to/what to do to improve it is greatly appreciated, as are all comments and criticisms (except those blatant thoughtless criticisms that don't help at all :-P)! ~Peace Edited by KimT, 10 August 2008 - 01:31 PM"

p8170
aS' The only thing that could have been better in my opinion is the wand, I always liked this one: I miss those wands! They could\'ve used it, but I think the wood wand kindda adds "realis" to the set, and since many fans don\'t like their castle theme to be too fantasized, I guess Lego decided to use a mold that was still being used for various sets'
p8171
aS" When I get this set I'm going to put it on the Tower in the King's castle, you know, the one that is right above the throne room? ;-) That'll be a great spot, and then I'll finally have all the necessary characters, the King in his throne, the knights on the walls, the wizard on his tower top, and the Princess in her tower room that floats in mid air and is connected to the throne room by a 2-stud wide bridge! :-D I love the King;s castle siege set *wub*"

p8233
aS" Here's the complete set in all its glory"
p8234
aS' Yes, I really like it, but then, Tabletown has the capacity to support it and my green Army have their eyes on it as a potential military transport as well'
p8235
aS" :-) I'll start out with the little airport ground car thingy - very neat and functional, here are views front and back: Next up, the steps which allow the plane crew to embark and disembark: And to round off this little trio, the cargo loading platform, here in its lowered position"
p8236
aS' Note the prong thingy sticking out from the rear: And here raised'
p8237
aS" The prong thingy is now hinged up to support the back of the platform and keep it level: Here's a slightly different angle so you can see the pieces under there: The all-important cargo itself! Hmmm"
p8238
aS'not much for a plane this size'
p8239
aS" The cargo pallet slots neatly onto the loading platform: Here's the complete set of ground equipment - all attached: And so onto the plane itself"
p8240
aS' Note that unlike the other large planes, the main wing sits at the TOP of the row of bricks making up the side of the fuselage: I took it apart a little so you can see the internal construction of the fuselage'
p8241
aS' Note that the cargo area is really small, right at the back'
p8242
aS' What else is this thing carrying? Illegal immigrants? :-) A picture of the rear of the fuselage, just because I like the sticker: Front landing gear'
p8243
aS' WAY better than on the other large planes'
p8244
aS" I don't know if this is a new piece or what but I've had no problems with it at all, and my kids have been playing with it as well: The rather sexy rear undercarriage - this area reminds me of one of those giant Russian transport planes - wicked: Those angled grey slopes atop each side of the rear undercarriage annoy the heck out of me as they KEEP COMING OFF whenever I pick the plane up"
p8245
aS' I think a 1x4 plate on top to bind them together might solve that'
p8246
aS' A slightly blurry view (sorry) from underneath'
p8247
aS' The gear LOOKS like it might be capable of retracting internally, but alas, no'
p8248
aS" This is a shame as there's certainly enough room in there and it's a wasted opportunity IMO"
p8249
aS' Might have to modify that'
p8250
aS' A view of one of the four engines, I personally think they look too small and should have something under the wing as well to make them rounder: Cockpit: Crew door, open'
p8251
aS' I LOVE the smooth action of these doors and the way they seal flush against the fuselage when closed: Cargo door, open: Crew door with docked ladder: Cargo door with docked loading platform: Cargo slots inside and locks into place the same way it sits on the loader, neat: The minifigs, sorry this one is a bit blurry: And that concludes this week\'s "Show and Tell"'

aS' *n*'
p8282
aS'I loved the pics in the catalogues but was a bit disappointed by the build and end result'
p8283
aS" My own thoughts: CONs: - as noted, the cargo space is really small considering the size of the plane, although I can see this is restricted due to playability - without the barrier in the middle, the cargo would slide all over the place while the plane was being swooshed - the cargo 'lift' (I'm not sure how else to describe it) is very weak and snaps off, although it is a clever design I think it's badly implemented - there is nothing to hold the cargo pallet to the cargo lift truck so it tends to slide off all over the place as soon as the truck moves - colour issues - I had at least 3 shades of green with the larger plane pieces and noticeable variances even with identical cargo hatch pieces"
p8284
aS' At least one of them also came quite scratched, which was a little disappointing - At $79'
p8285
aS"95 AUD it's $10 more than the Passenger Plane was with less pieces and figs, and no printed pieces whatsoever! more $ for less, methinks"
p8286
aS' PROs: - Lots of nice cargo crate pieces and even the stickers for these are pretty good'

aS" - landing gear piece adjusts very well to height differentials so the plane doesn't lose its gear as often as the earlier passenger planes - the hinging mechanism works very well to open the cargo holds - opens very smoothly and is not noticeable - I'd definitely like to see more of this technique - the little vehicles work well chained together and are all good small designs OVERALL: - I really like the large planes since 06 but I don't think they've still quite hit the nail on the head"
p8288
aS' Whereas the earlier planes were a little flimsy, this one is sturdier but has its own issues'
p8289
aS' The look of the Cargo Plane is nice, and the new landing piece and cargo hatch pieces are really great, but some design weaknesses and colour issues detract from the overall product'
p8290
aS" It's a shame as with a bit of tweaking this could have been a must-have set"
p8291
aS"Wow, that's a great review of a great set Dr S! *y* As you yourself have already noted, this has the potential to be a fantastic military MOC! With a bit of modification you can get the engines to be rounder, or perhaps do away with them completely and replace them with jet engines"
p8292
aS" *sweet* Though I can't think of a system to retract the undercarriage at the top of my head it seems like there's indeeed more than enough potential to do so"
p8293
aS' It reminds me rather of an Ilyushin Il-76, one of my favourite cargo planes'

p8319
aS' *y* What lacks : - A 2 x 4 cut out in the lower part of the nose to retract the landing gear'
p8320
aS' - A 4 x 6 cut out in the lower part of the tail to allow passagers to get off through the back like in a DC-10 - some real plates and tiles instead of these crappy wings'
p8321
aS' This part is the useless one that TLC ever produced *n*'

aS'The amount of cargo that huge plane carries! 8-? green peace would have a field day! X-D Nice review Dr S but this set is just too big for my town scale! ;-) Edited by casewindu, 05 February 2008 - 09:54 PM'
p8323
aS'Nice review, Dr'
p8324
aS' S! I have been thinking long and hard about the scale of the planes in my town'
p8325
aS" I would like to keep my passenger planes in their classic 4-wide fuselage style, but I really don't mind the new plane hull pieces if they are used as an enormous transport plane like the Ilyushin-76"
p8326
aS" Unfortunately I can't afford this lovely new green one at the moment (which would be perfect to go with my green army) as I took too much of a hit buying the new 2008 Star Wars sets! But I have modified my white one to take huge cargo loads, in fact my APC is designed specifically to fit inside"

aS" Unfortunately I'm a bit busy to take pics at the moment, but hope to put some up soon"
p8328
aS'Dr'
p8329
aS' S: I was not planning on buying this set after my disappointment with the other large airplane, but after looking at this image review, I just might buy'

p8331
aS' I think it looks great! Thanks for the review'

aS'If i do end up geting this set it will be for my slowly growing army'
p8333
aS' btw Nice review *y*'
p8334
aS'Thank for the review Doc! The only thing I like in this set is the small car'
p8335
aS' So I will not buy this set just for it! I really dislike those new planes, toooo bbiiiigggg! With this size, this cargo plane can carry just fiew things! What a shame! I think that the way TLC has made the wings is not very good'
p8336
aS' Like the rest of those big pieces'
p8337
aS' Just my thought'

p8342
aS"At my local Wal*Mart there was most of the 2008 sets including the Indiana Jones ones :'-) I picked up this one and the Motorcycle Chase! Name: 7621 Lost Tomb Price: $20"
p8343
aS'00 Parts: 277 Figs: 3 *Box Art First off we have the great Indiana Jones Box art!! I must say the designers did an excellent job on it! I love the little temple design with skulls! As well as including Indy in the right hand corner'
p8344
aS' The back of the box is just as cool showing all the neat play features of the set as well as an advertisement for the Indiana Jones Game *Figs First off we have our hero, Indian'
p8345
aS' What the hell? Why is there a freaking CW Anakin head on Indy!! There was a production slip up as instead of Indy\'s head I get Anakin\'s! :-| |-/ I open the box up and there staring me in the face is his ugly face!! TLC is defiantly doing to here a gnarly complaint from me!! >:-( Ok now here we have the " real" Indy fig that is supposed to come with the set :-D I just noticed that his fedora hat goes down in the back! Bonus Picture Time, Here is a jacketless Indy with his sleeve torn off, like he looks in the Temple of doom *sweet* The next figure up is our lovely Marion *wub* *wub* *wub* Plus her head is reversible with a scared face X-D Love the new hairpiece in black!! Finally we have our undead skellie with second style head and poseable arms *The Well Of Souls The set itself is a nice model and playset! The Anubis statues are very cool and I love all the hieroglyphs on the walls 8-? Here is the SW link with Artoo and 3P0 X-D The Ark in its resting place The Ark removed, its very cool indeed, but TLC should have made the whole thing in chrome gold |-/ not metallic gold with brown and yellow!! The closeup of the Anubis statue, Yes the Eye is a sticker but at leasts a gold color! *Playability First off you can pull the pin on the Anubis statues which send them falling and taking out the walls'
p8346
aS' Behind the wall a skellie swings out! There is a lever in the back of the model where you push down and the snakes shower down upon the figs hehe With the snakes all around, Marion is both modeling with the new carrot torch and fending off viscous cobras :-D In the meantime Indy uses his whip to scale the wall and avoid all the snakes which he is afriad of'
p8347
aS' In the meantime leaving Marion behind to fight them off'
p8348
aS' :-P The whip is bendable but it will always snap back into a coil, its some type of bendy hard plastic *Scoring Figs- 9/10 Model- 8/10 Playability- 8'
p8349
aS"5/10 Overall Satisfaction- 4/10 (would be 9/10 if it wasn't for the stupid Anakin head error!) In the end this is a charming set and could easily fit in with the adventurers! It has the cool Anubis statues as well as the Ark"
p8350
aS' Plus Indy, Marion and a skellie, great selection of figs but Sallah would have been better since he actually removes the ark with Indy However I am still wondering the point of the Anubis statues, this set does seem pretty silly :-P P'
p8351
aS'Thank you for this review! it is a brilliant set! i am definitely getting this set once Indy is released in New zealand hurry up TLC! >:-( PS:could i have pic of what Indy looks like with an old classic whip?'

p8418
aS" I still like the classic 1994 one and the 1980's can that was one of the first units I got"
p8419
aS'It looks to me that the little building is supposed to be like some sort of Customs checkpoint between one nation and another or like a toll facility on a highway'

p8421
aS'Hello and welcome to another, oh wait, first Batbrick and iamded review! Today us two sworn enemies will be reviewing the Creator Cargo Chopper, here is the front of the box: And while pushing iamded to his doom, here is the back: Haha! Ouch! Oh dear'
p8422
aS'here are the parts anyway'
p8423
aS' Here is the instruction of the first model, the Cargo Chopper'
p8424
aS' I love Creator sets for the different models, they always excite me'
p8425
aS' Just ignore me finishing off my nemesis in the background'
p8426
aS' Something very interesting that I liked in the instructions was this step where you must add those three 2x2 yellow rounded pieces under the chopper'
p8427
aS' This is for support while you build, which is handy, and later you take it off: And even later use it as the cargo'
p8428
aS' I found that to be rather innovative and clever, as well as - Hey! What are you hitting me for? Both instruction booklets have the same back: Now heres the Chopper itself'
p8429
aS" I love the design of it, it isn't quite minifig scale but its great all the same"
p8430
aS' This is my first non-Xpod or House creator set, and it sure is fun'
p8431
aS' Here me and iamded go for a dizzy ride'
p8432
aS' I love the nose of the copter, and the landing gear is fantastic'
p8433
aS' A shot from the other side'
p8434
aS" Oh dear, it seems we've been a bit sick from that ride, and were vomiting transgreen 1x1s"
p8435
aS' The cargo itself is nicely made, though I forgot to put on two tiles here :-$ '
p8436
aS' It fits in real well with the chopper to, and the line is great for giving iamded the wedgie he deserves: This is my first power function set, so I was pretty excited'
p8437
aS' The motor is intergrated really well into this set, and is activated by pushing that little 3x2 plate with the 1x1 slopes on it forward, until it hits the motor button, that orange knob'
p8438
aS' Another point of interest is the use of bley barrels on each side'
p8439
aS" I like this as I don't have those pieces in that colour"
p8440
aS' A shot of the motor'
p8441
aS' Its really simple, all you do is pull the hook out to any length that allows, then press the orange button and it will wind it back up'
p8442
aS' This makes the Chopper pull the cargo up into its bay, and iamded pull me here reluctantly to a whacking: A top view, is that MY head? A view of the chopper without the cargo in it'
p8443
aS" I love the lowered cockpit: The leftover pieces from building: (NOTE: iamded's head does not count as set piece) And a final shot of the set with me and iamded"
p8444
aS" Oh, it appear we're dead, oh dear"
p8445
aS' Hope you enjoyed this review, soon I will post the two alternate models'
p8446
aS' I loved this chopper, its great to play with and has nice construction'
p8447
aS' It also has some handy pieces too'
p8448
aS' The motor function sounds like a gimmick but is well intergrated into this model'
p8449
aS" Well worth the price, so far this is another win for Creator I say! So far I recommend this model, but later we'll see if the alt models are up to scratch"
p8450
aS' Also, since this is my first review, comments and criticism welcome on everything'

aS' Thanks for the nice review!'
p8468
aS'I wish I could just get those grey barrels alone, the rest of the set doesnt really intreigue me much :-$ Thanks for the review'
p8469
aS"Thanks everyone, heres part 2: The second instruction booklet includes instructions for both alternate models, which is good, I hate having too many manuals: Here she is, the plane: Its very nice and well proportioned, but where did iamded get that laser? Overview, the landing gear is very sturdy and nice, and the wings are surprisingly good: Top view, iamded's head fell into the propellers, I was trying to save him, honest! A view of how the motor on this one works, by pushing the orange button you can make the prop spin"
p8470
aS' It is well integrated like the chopper, though the prop only spins for about 2 1/2 seconds'
p8471
aS' Still, its a nice feature: The tail is also well made, simple, but lovable'
p8472
aS' Oh, and check out that tank! The prop spinning, Agh! Is that MY hand? Final view, there seems to be some sort of explosion here 8-| Well I think I got iamded more than me atleast'
p8473
aS' The second model is also great, though not as good as the chopper'
p8474
aS' The lack of space to fit something into the cockpit brings it down a bit, but it is a very nice model overall'
p8475
aS' I recommend it, though unlike the chopper it will be hard to mod into minifig scale'
p8476
aS' So far so good with 4995, here are the leftover pieces from the model: Enjoy! Batbrick Away! >:-)'

p8486
aS'Thanks guys, heres the final part: The Instructions for the boat begin on page 46: The overall set, its actually much nicer than I thought it would be, the pictures on the box make it look ugly'
p8487
aS' Top view, Tommy Guns do not actually come with set ;-) Side view, the designers have done an excellent job with the hull, considering the lack of many slopes pieces'
p8488
aS' You can see it is pretty much minifig scale too: Here you can see that by pushing in the red technic axle, the "anchor" on the front will be hauled back into the boat: Back view, these outboard motors are pretty cool, though I wish they could go own into the water more: Overall, though the weakest model, its still a lot of fun, and has a clever way around the lack of a shapely hull'
p8489
aS' I was impressed with it after the building it, it even has two rounded SNOTTy bottom pieces on the nose of the boat to give the impression it is speeding through the water with the front lifting up'
p8490
aS' Lots of leftover pieces for this one: The pieces: Sorry about the poor photograph there, it was getting late :-$ Overall the Cargo Chopper is another great set in the fantastic Creator line'

aS" Loads of fun, great play, and some clever designs, it challenges you to make your own things, and even includes some nifty pieces (bley barrels! *wub* ) I won't give it a rating, but I'll just say I certainly recommend it to fans of the theme and Lego fans in general"

p8528
aS"6258 Smuggler's Shanty Overview Smuggler's Shanty was released in 1992, it consisted of 69 pieces, 3 minifigs (two pirates, one Imperial) and it cost $9"
p8529
aS'25 (USD)'
p8530
aS' The set itself is a small but rather sturdy den for the pirates! Review: The minifigs consist of two pirates and one Imperial'
p8531
aS' The minifigs are not all that rare, which is disappointing, I would of liked a rarer fig! But still it is a good cheap source of pirate and Imperial figures'
p8532
aS" Here is an overall shot of the set, which includes the three figs, the shanty which is made using palm leaves pieces, and a nice grey shark nibbling at the soldier's oar"
p8533
aS' A close up of the soldier rowing hard in his boat'
p8534
aS' I would have preferred to have a normal soldier with shako hat, as I have more officers than normal soldiers now!: And a close up snap of the main structure'
p8535
aS' Note the wine glass, which was a nice touch! Funnily enough, only 4 pieces of treasure were included in this set, compared to the usual 8 gold coins in other sets'
p8536
aS' A view from the back, which also gives a good view of the pieces used to construct the shanty mainly simple black 1 by 1 bricks: The Shanty looks good from most angles but their are a few where the roof construction looks rather odd, but that is just a minor nitpick! Yet another view from the front,, this time at a slightly different angle'
p8537
aS' The yellow base plate looks rather nice too, I prefer it over the tan pieces we trend to get nowadays: "Attack!!" The Stupid drunk pirate in the background does not even notice! Overall I think this is a rather good set, despite some shortcomings, such as the lack of treasure and odd roof from some angles'
p8538
aS' The shark, Imperial soldier and useful parts make up for it, and of course the price is cheap on most auction sites, I got mine for a mere ?5 ($10), with the cheapest price on Bricklink being $8'
p8539
aS' Rate the set then leave your comments, thoughts and opinions!!!'
p8540
aS"First I'll comment on the review and at a later date I'll comment on the set"
p8541
aS" You've done a top job Lord of Pies *y* You've captured the set from a variety of angles and posed the mini-figures interestingly"
p8542
aS'Very nice review, Lord of Pies! Thanks for taking the time to put this together, and especially for all the detailed pics'
p8543
aS' *y* I very much regret that my dark ages occured when they did'
p8544
aS' Basically, I missed out on all the cheap and easy troop building sets, and this one is certainly no exception'
p8545
aS' The big sets are nice, but these are the ones that always make me wish just a little harder for a return of LEGO pirates'
p8546
aS" :'-) I gave it a 4 out of 5, just because I'd buy 4 out of 5 sitting on the shelves today, were it possible"
p8547
aS'Great little set! I bought this set only a few years ago MISB and I am still very happy about it'
p8548
aS' The hut is simple but very effective as a castaway building on some deserted island, the palmleaves are a good addition to any Lego collection'
p8549
aS' This set had a nice amount of weapons, two for each pirate and two of those weapons are flintlock muskets as opposed to just pistols'
p8550
aS' Nice poll as well, but you made sure nobody can give this set a 1 which is very nice (but probably a little mistake :-D )'
p8551
aS' I gave it the top-rating'

p8556
aS' :-P'
p8557
aS'Wow'
p8558
aS' I remember this set from when I was a kid'
p8559
aS' I got it for my birthday and opened the package first'
p8560
aS' Sadly, I had to go to school so I had to leave it at home and not build it or play with it until I got home'
p8561
aS' Needless to say that was one of the longest days of school ever'
p8562
aS' Good review, great set'
p8563
aS'I bought one of these new from Bricklink a few months ago as part of my Pirate splurge I went on'
p8564
aS' I really enjoyed this set because of the amount of figs in such a small set, though Pirates were always pretty good about their fig count'
p8565
aS' Also the neat little hut is nicely done for its purpose'
p8566
aS' Great review, btw!'
p8567
aS'Great small set that can help you add to you minifig count'
p8568
aS" The little boats are always cool, and the den isn't that bad either"
p8569
aS"Another first-rate review! It's a nice little set with a big number of minifigs"
p8570
aS' And 2 flintlock guns is also a nice bonus'
p8571
aS'A very nice review of a pretty and neat little set, thanks Lord Of Pies, guess its a 3 for me, with strong tendencies to 4'
p8572
aS'First of all excellent Review! 5/5 for me'
p8573
aS' I have yet to attain one of these sets'
p8574
aS' It has a nice trio of men including a redcoat, and a nice assortment of weapons'
p8575
aS' The rest, such as the leaves, is great for MOCing'

p8585
aS"A nice review and a nice little set for anyone's Pirate collection"
p8586
aS' A 5/5 for the review'
p8587
aS"I'd give the set a 3 1/2 out of 5"
p8588
aS' It needed 1 more Imperial to get a 4'
p8589
aS' A bigger basplate would have been nice as it appears to hard to fit all the minifigs on the island'
p8590
aS' Thanks for this great review'
p8591
aS'IMO this is a very simple and small set good to add some part to forbidden island'
p8592
aS' good'
p8593
aS"Laurinator- I don't mind an occassional old review coming back to life for discussion, but it seems you've replied to many old reviews that have been stagnant for years"
p8594
aS' Please try to refrain from "bumping" a lot of old topics as it pushes down new content that should really be the focus of discussion now'
p8595
aS'Well since this topic has resurfaced, I would add my 2 cents about my appreciation of this set'
p8596
aS' It was the first and (unfortunately) the largest Pirate set I owned as a kid, but I played the wazoo out of it'
p8597
aS' Some of the minifigs have lost almost all their face printing after so many play sessions! Theres just something about the hut that appealed to me more than the cheesy skull-face islands we keep getting'
p8598
aS'Probably that it wa kind of neutral, good for my pirates, settlers or islanders'
p8599
aS' Though the palm leaves were rather fragile and used to break off the studded parts'
p8600
aS' It would be nice to get more of these "beach village army builder" sets'
p8601
aS' Edited by Ardelon, 21 September 2014 - 03:40 PM'
p8602
aS'Hi guys'
p8603
aS" I picked these up the other day, but it's taken me this long to get round to posting the reviews"
p8604
aS' So, here we go: Tub comparison with a minfig (thanks Brainbox): The lighting changes a bit throughout the photographs, as it was going dark outside, so I only really had my desk light, and I kept getting in the way'
p8605
aS' 4837 Mini Trains Now the box I really like'
p8606
aS" It's no different to those of last year's sets, but the colour here is simply fantastic, and really seems appropriate for the theme"
p8607
aS' So this is what you get inside'
p8608
aS' All the pieces are still inside the bag, the optical illusion was accidental :-D '
p8609
aS' No pieces of particular outstanding interest, but the dark green cheese slopes are rather nice'
p8610
aS' Look out for those later'
p8611
aS" 1 2 3 This is the main model, and uses all the pieces in the set (bar these two, which according to the inventory are spares, but as with all my other Creator sets, I'm cheating and leaving them in)"
p8612
aS' This is far and away the best model of the three, and evokes the iconic version of a steam train'
p8613
aS" The green looks superb, but I'm not sure whether that's due to the model itself or the actual colour"
p8614
aS" Moving on, we get to the second model: 1 Leftovers (yes, I admit, I was using a piece of paper) This isn't actually a bad model"
p8615
aS" I don't think it's quite as nice as the previous one, but it's not bad"
p8616
aS" It's different from the first model as well, which is good"
p8617
aS' Too muich of the same can be a bad thing'
p8618
aS' Finally, we come to the third model: Leftovers Now'
p8619
aS" I'll be honest"
p8620
aS" I don't really know what this is"
p8621
aS" It's not that good a model compared to the other two"
p8622
aS" That's all I can say, really"
p8623
aS' And of course, all the pieces fit into the tub'
p8624
aS' Overall: I have to say, I do like this set, despite the weak third model'
p8625
aS' The strength of the primary and secondary models make up for any weaknesses in the third, and I can imagine the pieces being fully usuable in building other trains'
p8626
aS" While the basic idea of these tubs isn't quite as good as the X-Pods with regards portability and general 'niceness' they aren't bad"
p8627
aS' And for a fairly cheap price (?3-4) as well'
p8628
aS' 4838 Mini Vehicles This is one of those set boxes that you see because of the ridiculously loud colours'
p8629
aS' Sound marketing scheme if you ask me'
p8630
aS" I've managed it again"
p8631
aS' There are pieces outside the bag'
p8632
aS' Or are there? Now these I like *y* '
p8633
aS" 1 2 (I don't know what the clip is for, there isn't one on the other side) 3 4 5 This is the main model of the set, and again all the pieces are used bar these three, the spares"
p8634
aS" It's quite a nice model, although the car's a bit odd"
p8635
aS' Still, I like the ramps, and the colour scheme reminds me just a little of G1 Ultra Magnus'
p8636
aS' Hmm, I think that boom arm could do with refixing'
p8637
aS' 1 2 Leftovers This is actually quite nice as well'
p8638
aS" It's that classic breakdown truck, and the boom arm itself is quite nice, with quite a bit of movement"
p8639
aS' Another solid model'
p8640
aS" 1 Leftovers I'm surprised by the amount of detail here actually"
p8641
aS" Not only have TLC included a spare wheel at the back, but also what looks like a trailer hitch, which all adds to the 'realism"
p8642
aS"' Another nice model to round out a nice set"
p8643
aS' And in the tub'
p8644
aS" Overall: I'm not sure which of the two I like better"
p8645
aS' When I bought them, and on the way home, I much preferred the train set'
p8646
aS" But after building this set, I'm not sure"
p8647
aS' This is another good set from the year when TLC seems to be giving us so many'
p8648
aS" There are some good pieces in here too, and while there's nothing unique, they're still good"
p8649
aS" So, thanks for reading, hope it helped someone, and if there are any requests, I'll see what I can do"
p8650
aS" That's requests for pics, not songs ;-) "

p8700
aS' *y* *y* It makes me want to get 3 of them (or more) to make a long one'
p8701
aS' :-D'
p8702
aS'So here it is finally, my first ever review of a lego set'
p8703
aS"oh wait, it's actually 2 sets"
p8704
aS" So i don't really know how to do it right, but i'll try the best"
p8705
aS" (Sorry if some pictures are a litte bit dark, but i'm not really into photography and i got bad light here) Let's Start with the Dwarf's Mine Defender: Theme: Castle 2008 Set Name: Dwarf's Mine Defender Number: 7040 Pieces: 86 Price: ?9,99 (EUR) First, as always, the box: The back, a few instructions on how the defender works, for those how don't know ;-) : And the instructions: We continue with the minifigs, sorry i forgot to make a closeup of the dwarf: And finally the mine defender itself, i personally think it isn't as bad as maybe some people think"
p8706
aS' The chain for the catapult is great i think: I kinda love those controls, the mechanism with the rubbe rband actually works pretty well, but only on a not-glossy underground'
p8707
aS" That's pretty much all of it, it's small but i like it a lot"
p8708
aS" So let's go on to the tower raid now, which would be my absolute favorite of those new sets"
p8709
aS" -------------------------------------- Theme: Castle 2008 Set Name: Tower Raid Number: 7037 Pieces: 364 Price: ?29,99 (EUR) Again, first the box & Instructions: We got 2 sets of instructios here, one for the tower and one for the siege tower: The Minifigs, we got one archer and one soldier here, both with the torsos of the 2007 sets: Now thw orc side, starting with the great leader, with the new armor and the golden helmet (i love those pieces!): Closeup of the armor & helmet: Then we got another orc-knight: And the prisoner, with handcuffs! The Crownie Tower looks great overall, though there is something i don't really like about it, but later on that"
p8710
aS' Now the back, and that is what really bothers me, there areno walls on the first floor except the one with the wall-piece and the door, and theprison also is open at the back'
p8711
aS' The orc easily could jump out there: Not sure what these are all about, they really don\'t add much to the set: Enough rant now, let\'s go on with a pretty sweet detail, the golden crystal on the little table: The wall piece on the first floor you can ram in: And finally the very best thing of this set, the amazing orc siege tower! From the front: The great working ram, you can pull it back very far and it got pretty much power: Here we got another sweet detail, the siege "platform" that moves out by pulling a cord in the back of the tower: Finally a picture of a bit siege action: If you ram in the lower wallpiece, the brown shelfs of the prison-floor collapse and the prisoned orc is finally free! Summary: Likes: As i mentioned before, i really think that\'s the best ever produced siege tower, it\'s got so mich details and works extremely well, also the overall look of it is magnificant'
p8712
aS' The destroy-mechanism of the tower is pretty cool too, the brown door is a fine detail too'
p8713
aS" Nothing much to say about the mine defender, i like this little set, and there's nothing really to bother about it"
p8714
aS' Dislikes: The Back of the tower'
p8715
aS" That's really the only thing that's a bit bad imo, they could have put there 2 more walls on the first floor and something to lock the prison easily"
p8716
aS" Final Thought: The Tower Raid for me personally is the best of the 2008 sets so far, it's got great playability and looks simply good"
p8717
aS' My opinion: Buy it!'
p8718
aS"Tks for these cool reviews metalandi !! I love these orc sets !! I am so going to get these ;-) I'm happy to see that scared face again (I love it really !!) and the use of that handculfs !! That new armour looks really cool That tower is really nice and I wont mod it that much which os cool and the battle ram is freaking sweet !! Tks again for sharing ;-) *yoda*"
p8719
aS"Great review, pictures and all! Thanks for showing all the mechanisms of the tower, I didn't notice them from either the pics we had or the instructions--it didn't hit me that when you knock down the wall the second floor breaks"
p8720
aS' That is a genius idea'
p8721
aS' This looks like a superb set, unfortunately my priority right now is the Troll Warship'
p8722
aS' Still, if that really is U'
p8723
ag264
aS' $80, I might skip it and go for this instead, which is only $20 US'
p8724
aS' One note, though'

aS' I think there might not be a back cage on the second floor of the tower so that the mechanism can work'
p8726
aS' Did you try to see if the second floor ground still falls if you add it a fourth cage wall? Also, you could just pretend that the tower is built against a mountainside'
p8727
aS' It would fit perfectly and add more defense to the Knights'
p8728
aS' Great review! :-) VK'
p8729
aS"Tks for those so much!! :'-) *y* Nice reviews! I love that tower raid, and the defender, and will buy them both"
p8730
aS" Quote really don't add much to the set: Oh, but they do"
p8731
aS' More pieces= higher price'
p8732
aS'Thanks for these fantastic review'
p8733
aS" It's the first time I take a good look at these sets"
p8734
aS" There is a good chance I'll buy the Dwarf's Mine Defender, especially for that price"
p8735
aS"This set didn't come with the new jail door piece? I'd have guessed it would have, since there is an orc in prison"
p8736
aS' Nice review'
p8737
aS" I'm looking forward to picking up these sets"
p8738
aS' Steve'
p8739
aS'Thank you for these fine reviews, metalandi'
p8740
aS' *y* There?re really some nice playable features in the Tower raid set, and all these great Orc torsos, just sweet! And it even looks like that black Orc-armor?s a new piece, lovely'
p8741
aS'Cheers for the reviews'
p8742
aS" They're both nice sets, and I think I just may have to buy both"
p8743
aS" Or maybe I'll get two of the dwarf set? The figs in each are really cool as well"
p8744
aS" The dwarf, well, they're just cool anyway, but the troll with the golden helmet and armour, that's just *wub*"
p8745
aS'Thanks for the double review, I like the Dwarf catapult but the real deal is the Tower Raid set'
p8746
aS" I love that Siege Tower and love that new armour, can't wait to get it"
p8747
aS' Thanks for the review! Batbrick Away! >:-)'
p8748
aS'The Tower Raid has the best price per piece ratio in the whole 2008 line'
p8749
aS' Thanks for the review ^_^'
p8750
aS"Thanks metalandi! These are 2 great sets, I'm definately looking forward to seeing these in New Zealand stores! The collapsing floor/prisoner freeing mechanism on the tower is wonderful, a great touch"
p8751
aS' Some slight modifications, like, some walls, will make this perfect'
p8752
aS" And the Dwarf's Mine Defender is a sweet little set, with some neat minifigs"
p8753
aS' Thanks for the reviews! *y* ~Peace'
p8754
aS'Thanks for these great reviews! *sweet* The dwarfs mine defender looks interesting, the figs though are *wub* The only thing missing is a weapon for the dwarf and some shields The battering ram and tower are awesome! 8-? The Troll King with new torso, helmet, and body armor is simply amazing I like how the troll is handcuffed :-D The tower shows nice detail except for the poor "brig" '
p8755
aS" I love that gold crystal! The battering ram is a thing of beauty! $30 for the Tower and Ram and $10 for the Defender are very well priced! I still want the Battle Wheel more though! Damn Exclusives! :'-( >:-( P"
p8756
aS'Thanks for the review, I personally think the siege tower is probably the best one which Lego has ever produced'
p8757
aS"Well, I don't think Orcs are that sturdy, seeing that they'd have to jump from the second level of the tower, I don't see survival as his chief objective! :-P Awesome review! I'm loving these sets more and more! The Tower Raid is DEFINITELY the best and the cheapest set there! >:-) Oh, and Pirhana, it's not really a 'king', it's more like an officer"

aS' Remember, the Wizard rules these goblins! Edited by trooperdavinfelth, 22 February 2008 - 02:49 PM'

aS'*sweet* WOW!! Another excellent review! Haha, that tower does reminds me of KK II of Mistland Tower =x Well, overall, i love these 2 sets very very much *sweet*'
p8760
aS'Thank you for the nice review'
p8761
aS' Pity the tower is not designed better, but I still want to buy these 2 sets'
p8762
aS' If only there were 2 dwarves in the DMDefender'
p8763
aS"I got myself today 3 Dwarf's Mine Defender and I have to say that sets does suck big time: the plastic rubber band doesn't do squat, and 3 wheels i really not enough"
p8764
aS' I only built 2 of those and changed the front of it with 4 wheels and no plastic rubber band and I changed the 2x2 dark bley plate'
p8765
aS' Its still looks good but the crappy rubber band system is really not well thought off'
p8766
aS' Anyhow my Orc army is growing >:-) *yoda*'
p8767
aS'xwingyoda, on Mar 1 2008, 06:32 AM, said: Its still looks good but the crappy rubber band system is really not well thought off'
p8768
aS' *yoda* i totally agreed with your comments'
p8769
aS' The rubber system is not effective at all'
p8770
aS' I bought 2 defenders recently and i found out that when the wheels move, the rubber just stuck there without rotating the blades at the front :-/ I have not really found a solution for mine yet'
p8771
aS' So far, i only took out the rubber band, placing the blades on the ground, removing of the red technic part on the left side'
p8772
aS' In this way, when the defender is moving on smooth ground, the blades will move too ;-)'
p8773
aS'Thanks for the great review'
p8774
aS' *y* The siege tower does look great'
p8775
aS" I'll have to look out for these sets"

aS"Well you didn't say anything wrong yet undead army officer I perfer using the Batle wheel to knock down the Tower's walls, not the seige tower"
p8779
aS"The Rancor, on Apr 22 2008, 05:54 AM, said: I perfer using the Batle wheel to knock down the Tower's walls, not the seige tower I love all the siege machines the orcs have, they are certainly a much bigger threat than the skellies"
p8780
aS' Batbrick Away!'
p8781
aS'Yeah, the open towers are kinda funny, although they were also typical of (for instance) 90s pirate sets'
p8782
aS" The trolls' vehicles are cool though"
p8783
aS' They look evil'

aS'Green Grocer Reviewed by Dunamis Set 10185 2,352 Pieces $149'
p8790
aS'95 from The LEGO Store (Glendale, CA) Build time 6'
p8791
aS'5 hours Holy guacamole! Almost exactly one year after Caf? Corner was released we get the third installment in the increasingly popular LEGO exclusive town series'
p8792
aS' Combined with the famous 10182 Caf? Corner and its trusty companion 10190 Market Street this trio makes the foundation for an amazing city block of LEGO goodness'
p8793
aS' For those new to this series of sets, check out my reviews of the two previous sets in this line: Cafe Corner Market Street I would not necessarily recommend reading too many of my reviews in one setting as you might experience loss of brain cells and/or drowsiness'
p8794
aS' You have been warned'
p8795
aS' So, how does Green Grocer stack up to the two previous sets you ask? Well, follow along kind reader and I shall attempt to unravel this question'
p8796
aS' The Box: The gigantic box is pretty standard and looks amazingly similar to the Caf? Corner box'
p8797
aS' The back of the box shows some of the features of the green grocer as well as a lot of the cool interior that was absent from the previous sets'
p8798
aS' In addition, we are shown an image of the three sets together and a small insert image showing how they connect together (as if we could not master that difficult maneuver?) Opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals'
p8799
aS' As it seems to be the norm now, we have the reusable cereal box type tab system that we saw so often in 2007 sets'
p8800
aS' However, upon opening the tabs we are pleasantly surprised to find a cardboard tray! Have not seen one of those in a while'
p8801
aS' As you can see in the photo, we have two 32x16 green base plates, three instruction manuals and a bunch of bags that are broken into four groups: Group 1 has 12 bags and goes with the first manual and builds the first floor'
p8802
aS' Group 2 has 9 bags and goes with the second manual to build the second floor'
p8803
aS' Group 3 has 14 bags and goes with the third manual for the top floor and roof'
p8804
aS' And one bag that is not numbered and hence you can open it whenever you feel like it'
p8805
aS' There are no stickers ? Yay! Moving right along, we get to the three instruction manuals'
p8806
aS' The Manuals: The three manuals are 55, 47 and 47 pages in length'
p8807
aS' They are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings: - Piece call outs for each step - Parts inventory at the end of the second manual - Page numbers Color separation in these manuals was fine for me except dark bley and black'
p8808
aS' We get a nice photo of all three sets together: Plus, we get a nice tip showing how to split up the bags and what goes where'
p8809
aS' Those additional pieces you see in the photo just below the numbered bags are the pieces that come from the single un-numbered bag (along with the base plates)'
p8810
aS' Parts list Random manual shot The Pieces: Upon opening the first set of bags, one thing is clear; there are a TON of little tiny pieces! The minifigs are included in this first section as well'
p8811
aS' Interesting to note that there are a handful of printed pieces and as I mentioned previously, no stickers'
p8812
aS' We also get a host of new and exciting pieces to add to our collection'
p8813
aS' Keep in mind my scope of LEGO sets is generally centered around Star Wars, Technic, Creator and the occasional racer set so what is new to me might have been around 15 years'
p8814
aS' At any rate, here are some of the more interesting pieces: Again, note the printed tiles'
p8815
aS' This time around, LEGO has decided to include 33% more minifigs than the Caf? Corner and Market Street sets'
p8816
aS' Yes, we get four minifigs instead of three! Here are the cast of characters: Pictured (left to right) is Sir Top Hat, Miss Jenny Blue Overalls, Patti O? Furniture and little Timmy Cub Scout'
p8817
aS' I?ll leave it up to the minifig aficionados to decipher which torsos are new and to tell us all about the hairpieces'
p8818
aS' I can say with reasonable certainty that the four yellow smiley heads are not new (somebody check that?) Don?t forget the lovable little cat named ?Tom?'
p8819
aS' He is the arch-rival of the mouse ?Jerry? that lives downstairs: Overall, there are a lot of pieces, large variety and wide range of colors'
p8820
aS' The Build: If you have either of the two previous sets, you will feel right at home here'
p8821
aS' Just like in the previous builds, it seems like the first ten build steps are consumed with laying a bunch of 1x1, 1x2 and 2x2 tiles everywhere'
p8822
aS' Almost feels like 30% of the pieces are used up right away (see below)'
p8823
aS' There are several sections where you build various parts of the interior'
p8824
aS' Take a look at the cash register/counter below: And the beverage cooler: And the produce stand and everything that goes in it: Looks like someone has mail: Looks like someone just had a baby: This set is incredibly well done and gives inspiration to go back and add similar items to Caf? Corner and Market Street'
p8825
aS' As before, the average builder is introduced to some new building techniques like using the hinge plates to make the angles on the front of the building as shown below: Also the top of the roof shows some interesting ideas: Overall, it is a really fun build that kept me entertained the whole way'
p8826
aS' The Design: This is a great set with lots of little details'
p8827
aS' I especially like the little mouse hole in the wall leading to the Jerry the mouse?s area'
p8828
aS' They even included a little slice of cheese! It seems the designers can?t get away from the ?usual? staircase which I always feel is way too big'
p8829
aS' Maybe future designs can incorporate a spiral staircase to save room for other things in the model'
p8830
aS' One welcome addition is the fire escape as seen below: I?m going to show a bunch of examples of various items in the set so you can get the feel of the amazing detail in this design'
p8831
aS' Take a look at the lamps (torches?) just outside the door: And the streetlight with fire hydrant: Brickwork and archway: Awning: Here is the back side of the building'
p8832
aS' Note the trashcans and yard tools: Here is a close-up of the railings on the second story balcony and the second photo is the finished product with curtains in the window'
p8833
aS' Nice use of cups to make the banister on the second floor: Here is the fireplace on the second floor: Second floor staircase with Tom?s hiding spot: Check out the radiator on the third floor: More third floor: Nice grandfather clock and rug (third floor) Check out the deck that is up on the roof'
p8834
aS' Complete with two chairs, table, umbrella, flower pots and grill: Interesting use of minifig hammers on the roof: Finally, here is what is left over when we?re done: A couple of shots of the front: A shot of the back: And here are all three together: Overall Thoughts: This is an incredible set and the best of the three in my opinion'
p8835
aS' It is hard to top Caf? Corner but I believe Green Grocer just did'
p8836
aS' I absolutely love all the details and building techniques that went into making this set'
p8837
aS' There is a ton of different parts and wide color selection'
p8838
aS' As usual, we get a bunch of tiles and small plates, but that goes with the series'
p8839
aS' Also, we get four minifigs and lots of minifig accessories'
p8840
aS' I?m giving this set a score of 100%! I thought about it and I really don?t know how they could have made it any better'
p8841
aS' In short, RUN don?t walk to go pick this set up! Final Rating: 100% Build 10/10 (Excellent - Lots of nice interiors, details and accessories to build'
p8842
aS') Functionality 10/10 (Outstanding'
p8843
aS' Raises the bar with interior and detail'

p8846
aS') Parts 10/10 (Great selection and diverse colors'
p8847

p8848
aS') Price 10/10 (Price ratio is excellent but lots and lots of little parts'
p8849
aS' Well worth the price'

aS" I'd like to hear your feedback on this amazing set"

p8854
aS'A great reveiw dunamis *y* '
p8855

p8856
aS' It is a must have! I love the mouse hole and the mouse and his cheese *wub* '
p8857
aS"Damn you to hell Dunamis >:-( Now tks to you I really want the 3 sets put together X-D Wow that is what I call a sweet review 8-? Tks for taking the time to make once again such a fantastic one ;-) The overall look of the building is brilliant and I love the nice additions they did: the cheese and mouse (Jerry :-D ) is hilarious !! I didn't know Green Grocer had a rodent infestation !! And the use of the new built furniture and detils like the radiator is freaking awsome !! Also that set has a definite plus for me: its the back details !! I love the stairs, the deck with table !! Wowx that is what I call sweet backdoor details !! Now its clear that I will need to buy the 3 sets asap !! Tks once again Dunamis ;-) *yoda*"

p8862
aS" I'm crossing my fingers that there will be more buildings following after this one"
p8863
aS" I'm guessing that LEGO's just testing the waters to see how far AFOL's are willing to go regarding price vs"

aS' details'
p8865
aS' Green Grocer is still epic, though'
p8866
aS'For some silly (and quite delusional) reason I thought that I had a chance to review this first'

p8893
aS" There's nothing to criticize about this set"
p8894
aS" It's really the closest thing to perfection that I have seen from TLC"
p8895
aS' The difference between this set and CC is the interior detail, and because of that, GG now become (in my opinion) the best set EVER released by TLC'
p8896
aS' Do the CC/GG/MS sets fit well with the 50th anniv'
p8897
aS" town plan? My impression is that out of the box, at least, they don't"
p8898
aS' Which is too bad'
p8899
aS" However, I don't think it would be hard to mod the Town Plan so it looks like it belongs in the same town as CC/GG/MS"
p8900
aS' These sets, to me, are what I have always wanted from TLC as an adult'
p8901
aS' I hope they keep up the line, and add more elements to this excellent lineup'

aS'Wow, another old technic set review by you'
p8961
aS' Nice set, and thanks for that review'
p8962
aS'Looks like you have the original 1989 version with the yellow top cylinders'
p8963
aS' :-) I got one too several years ago, although I probably paid too much for it'
p8964
aS" :-P On a side note, if that pneumatic tubing feels harder and stiffer than the modern type, I highly recommend that you don't use it and buy some of the newer stuff off Bricklink instead"
p8965
aS' TLC originally used a different material for the tubes and this stuff degrades the nozzles (on pistons, switches and so on) over time'
p8966
aS" The old tubes also grip the nozzles much more firmly and if you aren't careful when removing them, it's actually possible to rip off the nozzles completely"
p8967
aS' X-O I had this happen a few years ago, although TLC replaced my broken pistons for free'
p8968
aS' I got rid of that stuff for good after that, although the pistons on my Power Crane still have slightly discolored nozzles'

p8971
aS" X-O I actually noticed that while taking it apart but didn't really pay any attention"
p8972
aS" I just thought that's because it's an old part"
p8973
aS' Well, thanks for the information!'
p8974
aS'Great pictures, especially the perspective from overhead'
p8975
aS' This is one of my favorite Technic models because it packs so many features in a relatively small space'
p8976
aS" And I'm working on documenting this one in Technicopedia right now! Thanks for the photos, Eric"
p8977
aS'Thanks for another fun review! This set is high on my list of things to buy, I love cranes, built many and bought many including the classic 8460 from 1995 and the more recent 8421'
p8978
aS' That threaded axle never stopped intriguing me'
p8979
aS" It was use in so few sets (I believe 8851 contained one as well?) and I still don't know why it's better than any other axle"
p8980
aS' Congratulations with a near mint copy of this set! :-)'

p8982
aS" It was use in so few sets (I believe 8851 contained one as well?) and I still don't know why it's better than any other axle"
p8983
aS' The purpose of the threaded axle is to carry tension'
p8984
aS' Regular axles are used primarily for carrying torsion (for gears), sometimes for compression (8855 landing gear, helicopter skids), and sometimes just for looks (roll cages, canopies)'
p8985
aS' But used in tension, connectors will usually just pop off'
p8986
aS' With the threads and the corresponding nuts, this part can be used to squeeze parts together (like the pen in the plotter of 8094), or to hold heavy assemblies onto turntables (like 8862 and 8851)'
p8987
aS' With the power crane (8854) reviewed here, that is the complete list of sets which used this part'

p9005
aS'This was my first technic set, aged 7! Still a great one in terms of function density, and a great B-model'
p9006
aS' In the UK I\'m certain it was called the "Salvage Hoist"'
p9007
aS'Hi! This is my third (old-school) technic set review! I don?t want to talk much, please enjoy just the pictures! #1 the parts: #2 building: The two axles, you can see in the middle, are not connected and don?t belong to each other'
p9008
aS' The axle on the left side is for the steering, on the right side for the engine'
p9009
aS' The dark-gray ?Technic Gear 16 Tooth with Clutch? allows the connection from the differential gear to the engine, trough the axle for the steering'
p9010
aS' The V6-engine: The winch: That?s a part you don?t see everyday: a 1x2 Rack'
p9011
aS' It only reappears in 2 sets from 2001 and 2004'
p9012
aS' (The Rebel Wrecker has been released in 1994'
p9013

p9014
aS'Thanks for reviewing all these old sets! Will you be doing any more?'
p9015
aS'yeah'
p9016
aS' If I rebuild and wash a model I will record it'
p9017
aS' Glad to see you liked it!'
p9018
aS'This set is really cool'
p9019
aS' I might actually get it!'
p9020
aS'Ah a good old retro review'
p9021
aS' Those old school days had some pretty impressive sets, with alot more complexity than modern sets'
p9022
aS' If you have it may I recommend 8880?'
p9023
aS'Nice pictures'
p9024
aS" I also sort out the pieces the same way if I'm rebuilding a model"
p9025
aS' *y* This set packs a lot of functionality into a fairly small size, but was rather expensive for its size ($70) when it was still available, compared to other sets of that time'
p9026
aS' You can also rig up the Technic flag sticker that it comes with to the main model'
p9027
aS" I've done that on mine"
p9028
aS" You may want to reinforce it with tape if you're going to leave the model on display though, as it will break up over time due to UV exposure like many stickers do"
p9029
aS' I had to do that with mine after it started to crack, although it still looks pretty good'
p9030
aS'the only original stickers are the front headlight-patterns on the 2 red 1x2 bricks'
p9031
aS" The others have been destroyed - must have been the bad decaying sticker quality that breaks when you'll remove it - so I printed them"
p9032
aS" I didn't print the flag for only the alternate model needs it, although it's a neat idea"
p9033
aS'! and LordGalewind: clickey! I keep that in mind'
p9034
aS' One of my 8880 is already dusty enough!'
p9035
aS'Thanks for reviewing this classic set'
p9036
aS" I got it when it first came out and still love it: the suspension, steering and robust look of the model haven't been done that well ever since"
p9037
aS' This set puzzled me though, back in the days'
p9038
aS' The rear suspending part containing the differential and some gears was shown different on the box from the instructions'
p9039
aS' In the instructions it showed that the (grey part of the suspension) in the back had to be made using a 1x2 smooth tile and 4 cornerplates (2x2) in grey'
p9040
aS' The box however showed a much sturdier solution using a 1x8 tile and a 1x8 plate'
p9041
aS' It is also visible on the cover of the instructions'
p9042
aS' The pieces I mean are in this picture: BerndDasBrot, on Mar 9 2008, 07:05 PM, said: Otherwise, great set!'
p9043
aS'Thanks! You\'ve just motivated me to go on a "senseless-preliminary-design-errors-hunt"'
p9044
aS"! A few things I've discovered: Left Side (Alternate Model): the steering link can only be put in place with a little violence"
p9045
aS" the handlebar (?) is turned (far more than it's actually possible) although the wheels are straight"
p9046
aS' Right Side: The 1x8 Tile simonwillems pointed out The half bush right next to it is'
p9047
aS" *can't_find_the_words* "
p9048
aS'"wrong"'
p9049
aS' Could be that the Technic Triangle is missing'
p9050
aS' The "windscreen"- 1x6 Technic Plates are mounted with 1/2 pins instead of Axle Pins with half bushes'
p9051
aS' Who can find more'
p9052
aS'? X-D'
p9053
aS'hmm, seems like the wheels are recycled into the harley truck in the 2008 batman set!'

p9055
aS' the harley-truck-wheels are thinner and somewhat more modern'
p9056
aS" I do believe they're the same like in 8274"
p9057
aS" Aaaaaaaand: for a long time in my life these wheels have been the best and coolest looking I've ever had! So where's your deference? :-D recycled"
p9058
aS' |-/ X-D'
p9059
aS"I've seen a few cases like this where the box pictures are slightly different from the actual model"
p9060
aS' The Airtech Claw Rig compressor is another one that comes to mind'
p9061
aS' The changes sometimes seem pointless and make you wonder why they bothered'
p9062
aS' :-P Quote the only original stickers are the front headlight-patterns on the 2 red 1x2 bricks'
p9063
aS" The others have been destroyed - must have been the bad decaying sticker quality that breaks when you'll remove it - so I printed them"
p9064
aS" I didn't print the flag for only the alternate model needs it, although it's a neat idea"
p9065
aS"! The other stickers on mine have held up pretty well, although I didn't try to remove them after I put them on"
p9066
aS' The flag started to break after a year or so and just fell off its axle at one point'
p9067
aS" I taped over it and it's holding up well now, although it's a little frayed along one edge"
p9068
aS" This is actually the earliest set I've seen that uses this crappy sticker material (which is unfortunately very common today)"
p9069
aS' Even other Technic sets had good stickers for many years after that'

p9071
aS'! Man'
p9072
aS', this set is a disaster what were they thinking! :-D :-P I just remembered one other fun aspect of this set: The crane hook can be attached to the underside of the rear bumper, to hold it in position while driving along, but when things are like this and you try and wind up the cable the winch is strong enough to break the (original provided Lego) rope'
p9073
aS" It 'worked' with my copy"
p9074
aS' :-D So this set is capable of demolishing itself'
p9075
aS' But still, one of the best Technicsets I have, with all stickers intact'
p9076
aS" I'm not so sure about that flag though, must check on that"
p9077
aS'Wow, that first picture is great! You must have a very wide angle lens with the capability to focus very close (macro)'
p9078
aS' The perspective makes the model look huge'
p9079
aS' Nice work'
p9080
aS' I think the suspension on this set is my favorite of all Technic'
p9081
aS' It has such large travel and is so'
p9082
aS' what word should I use'
p9083
aS' "bouncy"'
p9084

p9093
aS' :-) Did you use Ferrari to prove your point? Any physics teacher would have to admit that a really fast car, approaching the speed of light, will always look red as it drives away due to red shift!! X-D On the other hand, 8880 looks pretty fast and it is black, although I have seen pictures of one that someone built in red'
p9094
aS' Yellow might be good too'
p9095
aS' Some cars even look fast in green'
p9096

p9097
aS"I can remember that I've seen a few color variations on brickshelf and on ebay (They sold well)"
p9098
aS" It's new and familiar at the same time"
p9099
aS' That makes it more interesting!'
p9100
aS'Reread your review today! Great pictures! This IS a fabulous model'
p9101
aS' Got this model a few months ago for just  25! It is small and has great working parts'
p9102
aS' I love the way the front-suspension is made! Epic! I only had the light-stickers replaced with trans-clear bricks'
p9103
aS' BTW: The gear rack has been used in this years 8048 Buggy!'
p9104
aS'I also happened to receive this set this weekend, virtually MISB (the seals on the side of the box were loose, however everything inside was untouched)'
p9105
aS" This little beast a joy to build and even more so to play with! As indicated by Eric on the technicopedia page, it's crammed with functions for a medium-sized set"
p9106
aS' I think I love it even more than my son does'
p9107
aS'I read blackbirds technopedia page on this truck the other week, went onto ebay and picked up a MISB copy for 25 GBP Bargin, great to get old sets unopened, peeling the plastic off of the specialist parts was always cool! Love the front suspension'
p9108
aS'That price is exceptional'
p9109
aS" It's less than what I paid for mine 9 years ago, and is even less than the original price of the set"
p9110
aS' Note that the stickers in this set are the bad variety that will crack and peel over time'
p9111
aS' If you want to preserve them (the Technic flag in particular), you will need to tape over it'
p9112
aS'Somehow I also managed to get this set in very good condition (including box, instructions and all stickers) for a mere 22 a few months ago'
p9113
aS' This is indeed a very special set, and was a pleasure to build'
p9114
aS' The only flaw I noticed was weak support of the rear drivetrain, which was easily corrected with a few extra plates'

p9287
aS"I don't own the 8296, but what I can see from the pictures, I would say that 8296 is very similar to 8829"
p9288
aS' The only things that are different ist that 8296 is studless and features a steering wheel for the seat'
p9289
aS' But 8829 has got bigger wheels'
p9290
aS' >:-) It also would have been nice, if the wheels from 8296 could have the same tread'

aS' Set 8408 has the same problem'
p9307
aS' It took me forever to figure out what the problem was'
p9308
aS' If you take the engine out of the model, it turns nice and smooth'
p9309
aS' Then when you put it back in, it works terrible'
p9310
aS' It turns out the key is that, in the back, there is an 8 tooth spur gear and a 24 tooth crown gear used as a spur'
p9311
aS' If you look at Technica, you will see that there are two different crown gears'
p9312
aS" One of them works well mated with an 8 tooth on parallel axles, and the other one doesn't"
p9313
aS' The difference is only supposed to be longer teeth, so it really should not matter, but it does'
p9314
aS' If your set works bad, try switching the crown gear to one of the other variety'

aS'Hello All Apologize for digging out a such old post'
p9349
aS' Recently I got a bag of Lego Technic parts where there have been mixed three sets: 8858, 8829 and 8235 The resurrection of 8858 has been described by me in a separate post'
p9350
aS' Going back to the Dune Buggy  when I saw it for the first time back in 1994 I did not like it, as I was always big fan of 8840 (which I consider to the day the best looking Buggy) and set 8829 looked to me ugly'
p9351
aS' So there were those all parts in the bag then I though why not build it ? And I started to do it'
p9352
aS' When I finished I was very surprised how the final look of this set is! Really taking my words back'
p9353
aS' Unfortunately in the bag there were missing some parts and I could not rebuild the back spoiler'
p9354
aS' So I made some changes to it and make it from spare parts that I have and it came out acceptable'
p9355
aS' I also added some additional parts such as fake steering wheel, Rally logo, antennas'
p9356
aS' I have also reverse mounting of the rear tires  why Lego did them like that I never know  as I think they look better this way'
p9357
aS' Set: well the review has been already made by owner of this post so I will only add few things into it'
p9358
aS' Engine  V2 (aired cooled?) is driven by 4 gears -> from the single wheel (no differential as in 8840) using two old school z14 tooth bevel , then by z24 tooth crown and z8 tooth type 1'
p9359
aS' Actually the (as in most old sets) the pistons are moving very fast (not as in current sets) and smooths  I needed to extra clean all engine parts as there was a lot friction'
p9360
aS' Suspension  set has engine bay working using two old gray shock absorbers 6,5l  the movement is not big but works very nice, better then in 8840 in my opinion'
p9361
aS' Steering  this is a bit odd as there is no direct connection to HoG as in most old sets, but first the gear rack is moved by z8 then two z14 tooth where reverse movement is taking place'
p9362
aS' Later connection of two old school z14 tooth bevel goes to HoG Details  this is the most that I like in this set, specially how the use of axle pin connector perpendicular and 1x10 bricks with 3x3 cut corners and plate 1x5 toothed ends 2 studs with center axle hole are making the body shape  is just wonder'
p9363
aS' Tires  the balloon rear are pretty nice the front is a new version of those that were in 8840'
p9364
aS' What I do not like: 1'
p9365
aS' Missing of Technic Figure (8840 had it'
p9366
aS') 2'
p9367
aS' no steering wheel in the original set 3'
p9368
aS' no differential  but having in mind that Lego has introduce 24-12 teeth would be difficult to build the transmission in such small space where the engine is'
p9369
aS' I will shortly upload new pictures and post them here later on '
p9370
aS' Over all  I think it is worth buying it as it is very payable ! Actually very payable and runs smoothly , the steering, suspension  perfect Thank you and regards'
p9371
aS'Pictures of my restored set 8829 (I was almost 96% complete, and for missing parts I add of my own) The seat is black and not blue (as one was missing in my 8858) the spoiler is different, steering wheel added (not connected to wheels) and some additional items to make it look better) this is how I change the tire orientation The "new" rear spoiler: I still need to "clean" front rims Edited by AOW, 26 November 2015 - 12:32 PM'

aS' I like this review - it remembered my childhood'

p9674
aS'Hi! This is my forth pre-old-school review'
p9675
aS' As promised: a yellow-set ! My 8862 arrived today, survived the washing machine coaster and actually was real fun to build! #1: information: This set contains 664 parts (only! I thought Id be far more!) and was released in 1989 in the TECHNIC theme'
p9676
aS" Be sure to visit Technopediaif you want to know more! #2: building instructions: Wow these instructions are used! I'm not used to this after all this sets with unread instruction booklets"
p9677
aS' The pneumatics page: The last step for the alternate model: #3: the parts: Wow! Look at all those technic beams, gears, pins'
p9678
aS'! (A few parts are missing in this photo!) #3: building: The left worm gear is for the outriggers, the right one for turning the rear boom The three 12L Axles: left one: outriggers, middle one: steering, right one: erm rear-boom-rotation'
p9679
aS' The two worm gears in the front part: left one: lifting the bucket, right one: dumping the bucket'
p9680
aS' The turning-mechanism for the rear-boom is finished'
p9681
aS' Once again a toothed 10L axle'
p9682
aS' The Boat Weight 2x6x2 is hidden underneath the radiator grill'
p9683
aS' Okay many hoses and a nice, comfy seat have been added'
p9684
aS' Now you can recognize the Backhoes real shape'
p9685
aS' Only with a little violence its possible to lift the bonnet (?) through the Pneumatic Pump'
p9686
aS' Yeah, outriggers'
p9687
aS' Same technique that the 8854 uses'
p9688
aS' The finished boom / jib / scoop thing (=BJST) :-| X-D The finished loader bucket'
p9689
aS' And to end the building process: the same picture from the introduction'
p9690
aS' (OFF-TOPIC: It is all part of the miracle of nature! - The circle of life! #4: functionality: This time, I tried something new! I hope you can spot something - if not: Technopedia! Okay, here we go'
p9691
aS' #5: random shots: Ive got way too many pictures this time, so I refer to my brickshelf folder'
p9692
aS' Until its moderated you can follow the multilingual links! eins deux three quattro fem zes sdem osiem #6: final thoughts: Definitely worth buying! As a child I thought it looks hideous - but today Ive found out its totally fun to build and freaking functional'
p9693
aS' Three things I want to mention though: The BJST can only be slewed (a new word!) if the outriggers are deployed'
p9694
aS' It is also possible that the BJST will reach the ground (danger of grinding or sticking) even if the outriggers are deployed'
p9695
aS' The two mechanisms for the loader bucket can actually interlock, and the 14 tooth gears might break / disentangle from the axle'
p9696
aS' thanks for viewing the pictures, I hope you enjoyed it! Please comment if you want to!'
p9697
aS'Ah, what a very fine classic set'
p9698
aS" and all these lovely Technic beams with studs! *wub* Thank you very much for that excellent review, Bernd, and you did a fantastic job with all these great pictures! :'-) *y*"
p9699
aS'Thanks for the review'
p9700
aS' It looks beautiful'
p9701
aS' My father was a backhoe driver, so understandably I used to drool over this set in the catalogs'
p9702
aS' I never did get it though as Lego was so expensive in Australia then; I had around 2000 pieces and I thought I had loads! :-D Anyway, last year I bought 8455, which I love; it works great with a compressor I made too! *sweet* I wish mine had a real cab though'
p9703
aS" :'-( Do you have 8455 as well? I'd love to see how they compare side by side"
p9704
aS" It looks bigger than 8455 but I don't own any of the big old chuncky tires so I find it so hard to tell"
p9705
aS" By the way, I have been reading all of your reviews but I have been a bit busy of late so I haven't had time to comment"
p9706
aS' I hope you have more planned; any chance of a supercar one?'
p9707
aS'Another nice review'
p9708
aS' The slow shutter speed pictures are great'
p9709
aS' I think that was the only set with 8 distinct functions for a very long time and was only displaced by the 8455 Backhoe in that respect'
p9710
aS" The turntable on the back doesn't turn very well though, as the weight is all distributed on one side"
p9711
aS' The screw axle prevents it from popping off but there is still a lot of friction in it'
p9712
aS" I don't have mine built anymore but it might be worth trying to put a weight brick or something on it"
p9713
aS" Quote Do you have 8455 as well? I'd love to see how they compare side by side"
p9714
aS" It looks bigger than 8455 but I don't own any of the big old chuncky tires so I find it so hard to tell"
p9715
aS" Yeah, it's quite a bit bigger"
p9716

p9752
aS' :-P They came out with the modern turntable the year after this set, which mostly negated the need for these screw axles'

aS'BerndDasBrot, on Mar 23 2008, 02:32 PM, said: Hi! This is my forth pre-old-school review'
p9757
aS' As promised: a yellow-set ! My 8862 arrived today, survived the washing machine coaster and actually was real fun to build! The finished boom / jib / scoop thing (=BJST) :-| X-D thanks for viewing the pictures, I hope you enjoyed it! Another great review and a wonderful set of pictures'
p9758
aS' I like your nomenclature for the BJST'
p9759
aS' Acronyms always sound nicely scientific; much better than "digger"'
p9760
aS' No one would know you made it up until they found out what it means'
p9761
aS' I also really like what I will call your "kinetic photos"'
p9762
aS' They convey a sense of motion and show the range of the mechanism without the big file sizes of animations'
p9763
aS' How long of a shutter speed did you use? The secret to not getting too much friction in the turntable is using extra nuts and jamming them together'
p9764
aS" You don't want to actually clamp the nuts tight across the turntable"
p9765
aS' You want to jam two nuts tightly together at each end which prevents them from unwinding, but still leave a little free play (gap)'
p9766
aS' This way it will hold the assembly together but not prevent it from moving'
p9767
aS' Mine moves quite easily'
p9768
aS' This same concept is used on the pen plotter or 8094'
p9769
aS' "Slewed"? I think that\'s a word'
p9770
aS' How about "slewn" or "slain" or "slewifacated"? I think "rotated" is best'
p9771
aS' *sweet* Eric'
p9772
aS'WOW thanks for putting up this thread, that reminded me that I own that one too'
p9773
aS' *sweet* And I loved it as a kid'
p9774
aS"By the way, don't forget to build the alternate model of 8862"
p9775
aS' It is a combine (farm equipment) which is just as good as 8274'
p9776
aS' I liked it so much that I bought two copies of this set so I could display both'
p9777
aS' My favorite alternate model (not counting Universal Sets) is the 8480 submarine'
p9778
aS' Maybe it is time for a white set review? *skull* White is pretty rare'
p9779
aS' For your blue set, I recommend you review 8462'
p9780
aS' There are only a couple of green sets, and 8479 is the best'
p9781
aS' And then of course, 8458 is silver!! I think we all know what the best black set is'
p9782

p9784
aS"BerndDasBrot, on Mar 24 2008, 05:39 PM, said: could you explain your thoughts please? You know: my english skills ;-) I was thinking you could somehow attach a 16-tooth dark gray gear (the one that spins freely around axles) to the nut, which would make the axle move in and out when the gear turned and convert the gear's rotary motion to linear motion in a fairly compact package"

p9818
aS' I also see from your room photos that you have the 8839 Supply Ship which has lots of white'
p9819
aS' This is a really nice set'
p9820
aS' 8462 is hard to call old school, but at least it uses regular beams'
p9821
aS' The air tanks are the best part of the set'
p9822
aS' I wish LEGO had used them more often, especially on the highly pneumatic sets'
p9823
aS' The tank makes all the difference on 8459'
p9824
aS' You are right, 8458 is certainly not old school, but it is a great set with wonderful suspension'
p9825
aS' It is of the same era as the Super Street Sensation with all of the panels for body contouring'

aS" The 1x6 Bricks on each end make sure that the axle won't move in or out"

aS' Thanks for your feedback! While the assembly you have drawn would work as a linear actuator, I would not recommend it'
p9832
aS' The torsional stiffness and strength of an axle are proportional to the polar moment of inertia, a section property'
p9833
aS' Most of the stiffness comes from the outside of the cross shaped axle'
p9834
aS' But in the threaded axle, you lose all the stiffness of the outer area because it is not continuous'
p9835
aS' This means you only get stiffness and strength from the small core'

aS' okay too, but 8458 is IMHO not'
p9844
aS' Yeah, the Tow Truck was the last set that still used mainly studded beams'
p9845
aS' They made many changes to Technic the following year, with models becoming predominantly studless and making heavy use of the flexible axles/hoses and decorative panels'
p9846
aS' The Technic logo and box art style was also changed a lot'
p9847
aS' I really like the overall construction of that set'
p9848
aS' The model is fairly lightweight but extremely sturdy'
p9849
aS" It must be one of the strongest large sets they've released"
p9850
aS" Quote Did you had something like this in mind? That's basically the idea"
p9851
aS" As Blakbird said though, it wouldn't be very powerful and would put the axle under some stress"

p9948
aS' (Which are always good in a set'

aS' They are both really similar so it really depends on which colors you use more in MOC-ing, or which characters you like more'

aS" My personal choice is 8159 as it has cooler minifigs, except for Racer X's recycled head :-|, and the colors are more useful to me"

p10008
aS" Hehe, it look nice! Was thinking why other characters do not have a visor in front of their helmet Thanks Whitefang_sg, I don't put the stickers on because they can be very valuable latter on down the road"

p10036
aS'Thanks for the review'
p10037
aS' And for giving me directions :-P I think the design of these two cars looks to be better than in the other set'
p10038

p10040
aS'Thanks for the review, mate'
p10041
aS' I may get this as well, so I can get Racer X'
p10042

p10046
aS" I didn't count its appearances though"
p10047
aS'Speaking of pocket knives, I just got Speed Racer and Snake Oiler at K-Mart and might mod the helmet so it actually looks like the cartoon'
p10048
aS" The problem is - I don't want to shell out two bucks for a clear visor! >:-( By the way, I know trans-clear visors are non-production, but where did they come from? a pick-a-brick? if so, what store? Well at least if I do go through getting the elusive clear visor, it's not as bad as the insane $25+ red vader helmet! This set is great"
p10049
aS" I would have gotten this along with the one I purchased, but I didn't have enough dough with me to get both"
p10050
aS'Crap, now I want these sets!! Great review!'
p10051
aS"Very good review! These sets are a lot better than I expected, and for $20, I might have to pick up both! My family and I are going to Orlando this summer, hopefully I'll pick these and some other sets up at the Lego Store in Downtown Disney"
p10052
aS' :-D'
p10053
aS'As promised, and with only a single day of delay is my review of the 2008 set: 4994 Creator Fierce Creatures'
p10054
aS" This small set is the same size and price range as last year's 4939 Cool Cars reviewed by prateek and dillthepill"
p10055
aS' The box General info You get 193 pieces (vs 206 for Cool Cars) which is quite a lot, but most of them are small'
p10056
aS' There are a lot of hinges and some good slopes and wings'
p10057
aS' The building instructions contains three models, but no further ideas for inspiration'
p10058
aS' Primary model: Spider The first model is a big spider which shares some similarities to the secondary model of 4895 Power in the design'
p10059
aS' The legs each have 3 joints, where the ones in the middle have "stud joints" to be moved sideways while the rest use hinges for all joints'
p10060
aS' There are 8 of them and it does get a little tedious with all the repetitive building in this relatively small model'
p10061
aS' I like the design of the face with a lot of eyes and a big and ugly mouth, but the real gem is the X-pattern on the opisthosoma made using double/inverted slopes'
p10062
aS' It is poseable and I think it looks more "fierce" when inverted'
p10063
aS' Secondary model: Snake The face of the snake is nicely detailed with a splitting tongue and a mouth than can move a little'
p10064
aS' There is a problem with the construction'
p10065
aS' It uses stacked hinges for some of the joints, which are hard to pull apart without stressing the pieces'
p10066
aS" Tertiary model: Fly I'm not completely sure what this insect is"
p10067
aS" I will say it's a fly, although the tail and head are too pointy"
p10068
aS' This is a neat little thing'
p10069
aS' Conclusion Primary model: 8 It is a good design, but lacks some sturdiness in the legs'
p10070
aS' They fall off a little too easily'
p10071
aS" Secondary models: 6 They are pretty good when you look at the bricks that are available, but they don't wow you in any way and they suffer from the same issues as the primary model regarding sturdiness"
p10072
aS' Alternate models: 3 It is hard to come up with alternate models with so many small pieces and plates that are only 1 stud wide'
p10073
aS' The colors might make you want to build a Spyrius space ship'
p10074
aS' Playability: 8 The models have many movable joints and you can put quite a scare into your minifigs when their town gets attacked by these creatures'
p10075
aS' unless some EN forces are there to protect them'
p10076
aS" Price: 6 Creator sets are known for their great price to bricks ratio, but this set doesn't quite measure up to sets like Cool Cars"
p10077
aS" Pieces: 7 The pieces aren't great by themselves, but who doesn't need a fist full of hinges, slopes and basic plates in standard colors? I don't think this is a must-have set like the big rig was last year"
p10078
aS' The pieces are great and it has a nice primary model, but the set lacks a bit when it comes to the usual strong Creator qualities like alternate models and price'

aS"Enchanted Island 6278 Pictorial Review Original price: $66 Pieces: 412 Figures: 7 This 1994 set marked the beginning of a new era for Lego Pirates - it became a theme more centralised around playability and not so much grand ol' ships"
p10089
aS' 6278 Enchanted Island was the flagship set of the Islanders subtheme, heavily based around Polynesian and Native American concepts (In fact, TLC was successfully sued by a number of tribes for using bastardised Maori names, such as Kahuka)'
p10090
aS' It was released as a Legend set in 2001, but due to poor sales was discontinued again'
p10091
aS' The largest of the Islander sets, Enchanted Island is a portion of an island with a river running through'
p10092
aS' The left hand side features some sturdy buildings built into a tree-like structure on a rocky outcrop, whilst the left hand side features a tower built out of "wooden" posts and a large tribal statue'
p10093
aS" The box cover shows all the details; it does, however, differ from the instructions' finished product in that it has been more aesthetically arranged - bushes e"
p10094
aS't'
p10095
aS'c'
p10096
aS' have been moved to fill in gaps and to not obscure other things'
p10097
aS' The sides of the box show nothing particularly special, although in one scene it depicts the Islander Canoe chasing the Pirate boat with the treasure; just one way to play with the set'
p10098
aS" The back of the box, however, is superb, featuring a large number of alternative models: a toothy statue, a Pirate tree (think Wolfpack) with an Islander base, Kahuka's throne, a fire-breathing statue and a souped-up boat for the pirates"
p10099
aS' These, and many more, can be easily made because of the large diversity of pieces'
p10100
aS" The set has a huge number of minifigures for its size, the third highest number in the Pirate range (The SES and the BSB being first and second, respectively) - a whopping 7! 5 Islanders, including the all-too-common King Kahuka, the elusive Islander babe and 3 standard warriors - this set alone will never leave you short of enemies! 2 pirates, Ironhook in his standard attire with a scurvy dog at his side attack the island, although they are only moderately armed - 2 cutlasses and a pistol between them; a musket would've been nice"
p10101
aS' The Islanders, on the other hand, have 4 shields, a bow and quiver and 6 spears, not to mention the big pokey thing with horns on top (Weapon? Idol? Staff?)'
p10102
aS' A monkey, parrot and crocodile provide the obvious creature features, with a fair amount of gold to finish off'
p10103
aS" In the instructions, the goblet does not have the lid, although it does on the box; it's a nice touch anyway - adding a little more diversity to the monotonous treasure stashes"
p10104
aS" The pirates' boat is a nice 2 sail vessel, with oars for when the wind stops and a treasure map"
p10105
aS' The sails are similar to those in Lagoon Lockup, but with an extra front sail'
p10106
aS" It's an awesome little boat, better for raids than a rowing boat, but not too big that it can't sail up rivers"
p10107
aS' It can comfortably fit 2 men and, at a squeeze, 5'
p10108
aS" The sails are expensive if you buy them seperately; normally this won't be a problem, but they can cost aroun $5 each"
p10109
aS" The Islanders' boat is a canoe with a sail and an outrigger to stabilise it"
p10110
aS' The sail is beautifully done, with 2 spars taughtening it'
p10111
aS' There is a clip for the rower to leave his weapon when at se and the mast can turn to get as much wind as possible'
p10112
aS" It's quite a top-heavy boat, but it doesn't look hideous and without the mast/sail it looks great"
p10113
aS' 3 Islanders can fit in it, and more if they sit on the outrigger'
p10114
aS' The markings on the canoe are stickers, but they look fine and are probably more robust than markings for their job'
p10115
aS" Furthermore, they're waterproof! *sing* Kahuka's throne can be carried by 2 loyal subjects"
p10116
aS'Or strapped to his pet crocodile! The clips on the side can be used to rest his weaponry, or hold spears for battle'
p10117
aS" The throne looks nice, although I'm not too sure about the blue against the red - I'd have prefered white as it would clash less"
p10118
aS' An overview of the island; it is built in 2 halves - left then right and then joined together loosley, so it can be seperated for transporting'
p10119
aS' Around the back to the left and right, there are large open spaces that are great for battles - this set isn\'t so much about a large solid build, but creating a "village" - smaller structures linked by bridges'
p10120
aS' And the back'
p10121
aS' To the far left is a platform built onto the rock, with access from the river via a ladder'
p10122
aS" There's the standard Islander drum with the lovely zebra-skin part (Where did they get that?!)"
p10123
aS" I've never understood the white flag - I was under the impression it was used for surrender"
p10124
aS' Further along the rocky bank, there are some hinged palm leaves that swing upwards to reveal'
p10125
aS"The treasure! It's an OK hiding place; not the best place to hide it, right where the pirates sail past, but it feels fabulous; it fits right in"
p10126
aS' Above it on the rocky bank is the main structure'
p10127
aS' It looks very disjointed when you build it (bricks all over the place), but once it\'s done it looks nice and rural, with leaves everywhere and the "balcony" where Kahuka is standing'
p10128
aS' You get a nice roof made from 2 large palm leaves tilting down'
p10129
aS" Around the back there's a slight shelter, a table for picnics and a ladder to access the upstairs"
p10130
aS' I was rather annoyed that it is so open, but the set is designed from just one perspective'
p10131
aS' To the left is the bridge to the other building'
p10132
aS' A nice, one piece bridge made of the softer plastic used for muskets and the post-1991 cutlasses'
p10133
aS" It looks good, but be warned! It tilts when you pull a pin, sending the pirates flying! This contraption is a good idea, but it is very stiff and so doesn't swing, even when burdened by a minifigure - you'll want to modify this bit if you get it"
p10134
aS' The other building looks like it is made out of posts and beams'
p10135
aS' They are all red; brown would have been better, but it would have added too many colours to the range, just like the use of black for trees in some forestmen sets'
p10136
aS" There are 3 clips for spare weapons; only 2 of these will ever be used when all the Islanders are armed, but it gives the pirates scope once they've been disarmed"
p10137
aS"There's another nice palm tree roof on top"
p10138
aS' 2 ladders give access'
p10139
aS"there's a total of 4 in this set - worth getting, eh? Although they're 5p on Bricklink, for a KABOB, they're like gold! At the top there's another hidey hole; the palm leaves lift up on hinges to show the treasure or hiding Islander"
p10140
aS' It can be seen from behind, but this set is designed from one perspective only'
p10141
aS' Nice cattlehorns too'
p10142
aS"alongside the slats you can see in the floor - 5 years later and it would've been a solid plate"
p10143
aS" The big statue is one of the main selling point of this set, alongside the tilting bridge - they're the action features shown in every catalogue at the time, but it is not really special, just original"
p10144
aS' The statue fits in with the theme perfectly - Kahuka\'s mask, his shield and this statue all depict the same deity, which is a nice "collectible" idea'
p10145
aS' The back is rather plain, except the angled 1x1 bricks - a good touch'
p10146
aS" I'm not sure why there's a black brick in the back of the head, but this is easily remedied; it could even be done with a brick from this same set, just swapping the two over"
p10147
aS' Aside from the head turning, the back can open to store sacred objects, or, in my opinion, prisoners, hence the gaps for breathing'
p10148
aS" Either way, it's a lovely piece of architecture and deservedly a flagship element of the set"
p10149
aS" There's your standard cooking pot floating around, although a 1x1 yellow stud as human flesh (remember, minifigs are yellow, no matter what the licensed themes say!) is a superb finish"
p10150
aS" This set is a stunning set for both kids and AFOLs who are just getting back into Lego/Pirates - it is a great army builder and, due to its release as a Legend, is extremely cheap on eBay - you should be able to pick one up for 18, or 15 if you're lucky"
p10151
aS" For that you get a lifetime's supply of Islanders, 4 ladders, some wall panels, 2 baseplates (one raised and both with rivers and printed vegetation around the edge), a ton of weapons, a fair quantity of standard bricks, but most of all, a heap of vegetation: This is an easy to buy set, with normally around 5 on eBay at any time, and is well worth it, for the parts, the play and the nostalgia! It can be easily modified; when used in conjunction with any other outpost, a much larger fortress can be made, especially if more rope bridges are used"
p10152
aS" if you pick 2 of this fine set off eBay (It'll still be less than the original price!), a huge complex can be constructed, giving you an instantaneous village for around 35"

p10157
aS' I was in my dark ages throughout the Islander days, though I have built up a small force of them (10?) from eBay buys, but no actual sets'
p10158
aS' If this is really as reasonable as you say there, I may just have to pick one up soon'
p10159
aS" Oddly, I do own the baseplates to this set, having also picked them up in a lot on eBay, so I might be able to recreate it manually, but I think I'd rather pick one up whole"
p10160
aS' It looks like a great mix of parts and makes a decent looking display piece'

aS'A great and informative review with very fine pictures, thanks SlyOwl! *sweet* A wonderful set this is indeed, full of nice details and pretty playable, and a cool subtheme that offers a lot of fantasy and charming characters in a marvelous layout'
p10179
aS' I really love that little boat with the outrigger, and the neat buildings and sweet landscaping works together very well'
p10180
aS' TLC got sued for using some names of native sounding origin? Now that sounds really strange to me'
p10181
aS' such namesre widely spread within novels, movies and such stuff, I didnt know that theres some kind of copyright on them'
p10182
aS' 8-|'
p10183
aS'Good review, mr'
p10184
aS' SlyOwl! And good pics too! I know it probably deserves better but I only give him a 3'
p10185
aS" I'll be surely the only saying that I don't like this set but I remember I had it for christmas when I was a child and it disappointed me very much because I expected it much larger after seeing it in the LEGO catalogs"
p10186
aS' Well it\'s just a little trauma I had :-P LOL Anyway I must admit it\'s an interesant set, specially because of the large number of mini-figures and accesories it brings with and the two little "ships" Edited by BlueBard, 31 March 2008 - 01:13 AM'
p10187
aS'Excellent review of an outstanding set! I love the main image'
p10188
aS' I want this set so bad!'
p10189
aS'Yay! Pictures! Thank you for the review'
p10190
aS' You made me actually consider looking it up on ebay, but I already have so so many things to get on my want list'
p10191
aS' Drat my easy ability to get sold on something lego!'
p10192
aS"It's a great set and one I have yet to add to my collection despite my large number of Islander extras"
p10193
aS' Enchanted Island, aside from having so alluring a name was good value for money in that you only needed this one set and you had a good representation of the islanders both in the size of the set and the number of minifigs'
p10194
aS' The flipping rope bridge and the river give it a great rainforest retreat sort of feeling and one is inclined to think of this set as more inland than directly coastal for me'
p10195
aS' Whilst the Islanders were never seen in the same light or popularity as Pirates and Imperials they were an obvious and colourful addition that to me added a whole new depth to the Pirate system and one was now able to play a 3 or 4 way war adding a greater political element to the sets'
p10196
aS' Enchanted Island is probably the 3rd most appealing of the large land bases for me after Port Royal and Eldorado Fortress'
p10197
aS' Good review and glad to see the set recognised!'
p10198
aS"SlyOwl, you're a legend! Thank you for taking the time to do such a comprehensive review"
p10199
aS" You've captured Enchanted Island in impeccable detail and anyone who doesn't own this set should know it inside-out by now"
p10200
aS' I shall write my thoughts on the set itself, directly'
p10201
aS'For some reason I never considered buying this set'
p10202
aS' But your review changed that'
p10203
aS" I'll try to get it on eBay"
p10204
aS' Thanks for your efforts to make this wonderful review for us'
p10205
aS" It's now added to our index"
p10206
aS"Wow, that is one great review you made Sly! I gave it a four, only thing i don't like is the raised baseplate"
p10207
aS' It does get you a lot of figs, two ships and some nice assecories, great set!'
p10208
aS'Great review! I think this set looks great'
p10209
aS' I really like the islanders and that statue is really nice'
p10210
aS' It comes with a lot of nice leaves and I like all of the secret compartments and the like'
p10211
aS' Thanks for the nice review!'
p10212
aS'Thanks for the review! I am getting very interested in the classic pirates sets, and I wat some now'
p10213
aS' This seems like it would be a great starter'
p10214
aS"I was just going into my dark ages when LEGO began the Islander themes, so I've never really cared for them"
p10215
aS' BUT this review actually made me want this set real bad'
p10216
aS' I guess this is what reviews are for then - good job on the review'
p10217
aS'Great review! I recently got this set for only 150 SEK, around $17, and its really good!'
p10218
aS"Everytime I saw this at a toy store I always cried to my parents for one, but never got it, I got the smaller islander sets, but the more I see this now, I don't want it, I could buy it, but naahh, I am hoping Lego does an updated version of the islanders with this new pirates line, one can hope right!! XD"

aS'Eldiano, thank you for posting about your desire to have this set'
p10225
aS' I do own the set, and I do recommend it to others if they somehow find a used one'
p10226
aS' The bricks are kind of sparse, but the the bricks it does come with are really nice, I love the figs, and the base plates are by far my favorite made by TLG'
p10227
aS' Captain Braunsfeld, I suggest that you read through the link that covers topic bumping more clearly'

aS' If you\'ve got an answer to a question (such as "Does anyone have pictures of the alternate model?) then by all means post! What you shouldn\'t do is ask questions to the original poster; he/she may not even visit EB any more'
p10235
aS'Fortunately I got this set on 2000 (not the released version, the original one)'
p10236
aS' And I said "fortunately" because it\'s a lovely set'
p10237
aS' How could I rate it, but awesome? A little Islander "army", the islander girl, Ironhook and that cool boat with two sails, the jail-polynesian statue'
p10238
aS' I must recognize that I have a thing with the Islanders'
p10239
aS' I know that they are weird, poorly based on the polynesian aborigens, etc'
p10240
aS' But they are very original, broke with the traditional enemies, and gave to the Pirates theme an exotic and wild look'
p10241
aS'I realized that building the chess set from the new pirates theme, they are two grey heads that reminded me of the king kahuna throne, which goes to say that I am hoping they bring back new sets, I just wish they were bigger'
p10242
aS' I would love to build the old ones, but I would side more towards the newer model if they ever released them'
p10243
aS'What an amazing (old) set! I loved Pirates in my childhood, but that was before the Islander and Spanish stuff'
p10244
aS' mine were the BSB and soldier fortress with the big baseplate'
p10245
aS" As I'm now returning to Pirates, I've tracked down most of the 2009 sets and of course bought the new 2015 sets"
p10246
aS' but knowing I missed this "middle" period of Islanders vs Pirates makes me a bit sad'
p10247
aS' those Islanders are soooo "Monkey Island" (those of my age likely feel the same) to my eyes! Oh for a "Lemonhead" minfig'
p10248
aS" ;) I'm curious now how much this set sells for, given it was apparently one of very few Lego actually re-released! I recently bought a MISB BSB that was an early 2000's re-release, and it was very pricey"
p10249
aS' but then, I suspect the BSB has a LOT more of a nostalgic following these days than this set! Can anyone give me a rough idea what this set goes for in as-new condition these days? Regardless, a fantastic review with some great photos of the whole set and minifigs'
p10250
aS' even though this is an old thread, I am glad someone else bumped it recently so I can add my thoughts too'
p10251
aS' :) One thing I\'ve noticed comparing the newest Pirates sets to the 80\'s ones I had as a kid (and these from the 90\'s) is the move away from baseplates and big "panel" pieces'
p10252
aS' I actually like that in a lot of ways; whilst I miss baseplates being included as they are a great starting point for creating new things (and make the sets easier to "play" with), visually, I think Lego-designed model sets look better without them'
p10253
aS'here is a preview of my review of speed racer: Grand Prix Race i will try to get a full review up later today pics (when public) sorry about the blur, i am not a great photographer'
p10254
aS" also if, there are any pictures you would like (that i haven't included), just ask"
p10255
aS"Judging from your pictures there seems to be many interesting torsos and new fleshy heads but I don't think this set is for me"
p10256

p10265
aS'I will most likely get all the speed racer sets as it was one of my favorite movies(the animated one) i just loved the decked up and tricked out cars >:-) great review and red tux = X-D'
p10266
aS'Looks like a great ole set to me'
p10267
aS" The cars seem abit overly slopey to me though, I'll probably pass on this"
p10268
aS" But as a note, I especially like the black and yellow car's horizontal wheel covering things"
p10269
aS' Nice :-$'
p10270
aS'again, no problem! personally i would have liked a lower price ($96'
p10271

aS'doubt ill get this, i used to like the anime but the the film looks cheesy as a cheese sandwhich'
p10275
aS'Sorry to bump such an old thread, but Ive just discovered this set is on sale at Amazon'
p10276
aS'de - for a mere 25 Euros'
p10277
aS' I am tempted'
p10278
aS' Not because I like the set or the models, but because of the parts'
p10279
aS' As most of you might know, Im especially into Exo-Force'
p10280
aS' So would you recommend to get this set just for the parts? Are they a good choice to combine with EF-sets? Would anyone of you be interested in obtaining the fleshie-parts of the minifigs from me, as I totally dont need those?'
p10281
aS"I picked up this set a few weeks ago (along with the smaller sets that come with the Mach 5 and Racer X's car), and I was pleasantly surprised"
p10282
aS" The commentator's stand is nothing to write home about, but the assortment of figs is great (numerous new face prints in flesh, I believe), and in spite of the large amount of stickers, the three cars are each unique and very well-designed"
p10283
aS" My only gripe about them is that Cannonball Taylor's car (the black and yellow one) was a missed opportunity, as in the movie it's yellow and purple"
p10284
aS' I know TLC is dropping purple for the future and had a bunch of problems with it in the past, but it would have made for a great looking car IMO'
p10285
aS'Well'
p10286
aS' Thanks for your posting, but I couldnt care less about fleshie minifigs or movie-accurate cars - or the cars at all'
p10287
aS' This set would really ONLY go into my parts bin'
p10288
aS' Therefore I need to know what parts are in there and if they are "cool" enough to go into an Exo-Force collectors parts bin'
p10289
aS'An opportunity has come up to buy this set for 100 AUD'
p10290

aS' This is the first page'
p10322

p10323
aS' Yeah'
p10324
aS' Random page: I forgot the overall thoughts to the instructions: These are Technic instructions as were used to them: part count, easy to understand (okay, the string part at the end was too much for me) and the color distinction is okay too'
p10325
aS' 100 pages long and if I can trust my eyes the pneumatics page can be fold out'

aS' The 1x6 Technic Beams on the left side are normal'
p10346
aS' The axle that will extend the crane: 7 gear racks 1x4 the 1x6 Technic plate will keep the two pneumatic cylinders straight'
p10347
aS' *sad* 8-| Huh? Did you blink? You missed a special part: The whole rotatable thing will be attached to the Technic turntable using two long Technic pins'
p10348
aS' The pin on the right side should be in the middle of the three turntable holes'
p10349
aS' On the right side, its the first hole'

p10353
aS') :-P two axle rack and pinion steering, pneumatic luffing and gear driven telescoping via crank for the boom which can slew 360 on turntable driven via gear, crank driven hoist and gear driven outriggers at four corners which snap over center'
p10354
aS' #7 random shots: Comparison to 8854: uuuh once again a depth of field'
p10355
aS' I tried to make it look authoritarian like 8858 but I failed'
p10356
aS' Somehow 8460 looks cute'
p10357
aS' #8 comparison to 8421 Mobile Crane / Crane Truck: I feel that a question concerning this will be asked, so I deal with it right now'
p10358
aS' First of all: I dont own 8421 yet'
p10359
aS' I know'
p10360
aS' A Technic freak really should own it'
p10361
aS' Anyway: 8421 has more than twice as much parts as 8460, is motorized, features a V6-engine and a very neat mechanism to extend the crane/boom twice using a braided string with end studs'
p10362
aS' Try to find out how! Of course 8421 features (far) more than 8460'
p10363
aS' IMHO 8421 should have been a copy of 8460, a set so successful that it has been rereleased two times, but the designers overshoot the mark'
p10364
aS' 8421 is a (breathtaking) monster'
p10365
aS' Compared to it, 8460 looks cute - not pale! #9 final thoughts: I got it on eBay in kind of good condition, for about 50 dollars'
p10366
aS' I know that it has been worth the money in any point of view'
p10367
aS' *wub* I didnt use the word old-school for now'
p10368
aS' Ill change that: 8460 belongs to the favored few of old-school Technic sets! thanks for reading and viewing the pictures, I hope you enjoyed it! Please comment if you want to!'
p10369
aS'Ah, thanks sommuch again for that great review! *y* *sweet* Man, I am so happy they made this set'
p10370
aS' The new one seems too boring'
p10371
aS'Somehow I competely missed your review when you first made it, I saw your pics on brickshelf and wondered about the review'
p10372
aS' You have managed to review my all time favourite technic set! It was the first large Technic set I was given by my parents, when it first came out in 1995'
p10373
aS' I played for hours with this set, making minifig seats in it (it was so huge there was room for four minifigs to sit next to eachother in front'
p10374
aS') I made various applications for it, a bungee-jump system with a large rubber band, and lots of containers to be lifted'
p10375
aS' The first changes I made included the inverting of the wheels and the disabling of one of the flashlight-steering wheels because they obstructed eachother'
p10376
aS' By the way, the nob for your winch is yellow instead of black (I know this set by heart, so watch out :-P )'
p10377
aS' I always liked those nobs'
p10378
aS' I do own the 8421 and I can tell you: this 8460 is much, much stronger, it can carry more weight because the boom is lighter then the 8421: they are powered by the same two pistons'
p10379
aS' You know when you made it right: when the crane is in upright position, fully extended and you release the brake from the winch'
p10380
aS' Does the hook lower without having to pull it? If it does, you succeeded in constructing the set right'
p10381
aS' The alternate model was great fun too, the pump is cleverly hidden and the crane folds up great between the cab and the loading platform'
p10382
aS' You could easily mod it with a pneumatic claw on the crane, a motor to turn it and a compressor'
p10383
aS' The only flaw was the loading platform which had no floor (only some axles)'
p10384
aS' Thanks so much for reviving my memorie concerning this great set! *y*'
p10385
aS"I'm in the same situation as you; I have this set but missed out on the newer 8421"

p10389
aS' The box designs in general are crappier these days than they used to be 10 years ago'
p10390
aS' You don\'t see the old "featured parts" trays anymore and the boxes don\'t have the different sections either (these also acted as internal supports for larger boxes, so they were less prone to being crushed)'
p10391
aS' The cardboard material is also quite a bit thinner'
p10392
aS" I think it's a result of TLC's overall cost-cutting moves since then"
p10393
aS" Most people toss the boxes and probably don't care, but I keep all of them"
p10394
aS' There was actually a time when the boxes used to be even stronger'
p10395
aS' I have an old 8859 set and the outer box is made of a hard, styrofoam material, although they probably stopped using that for environmental reasons'

p10410
aS' You have managed to review my all time favourite technic set! yeah, somehow I wonderd why only VBBN (thanks!) responded'
p10411
aS' But I learned from *yoda*s sig: "Patience !! For a Jedi it is time to eat as well !! Eat, Eat !! Hot !! Good food !!" :-D simonwillems said: It was the first large Technic set I was given by my parents, when it first came out in 1995'
p10412
aS' I played for hours with this set, making minifig seats in it (it was so huge there was room for four minifigs to sit next to eachother in front'
p10413
aS') I made various applications for it, a bungee-jump system with a large rubber band, and lots of containers to be lifted'
p10414
aS' The first changes I made included the inverting of the wheels and the disabling of one of the flashlight-steering wheels because they obstructed eachother'
p10415
aS' By the way, the nob for your winch is yellow instead of black (I know this set by heart, so watch out :-P )'
p10416
aS' I always liked those nobs'
p10417
aS" and people think you can't play / MOC with Technic (at all)"
p10418
aS'! X-D about the nob: erm yeah'
p10419
aS' I only found 3 black ones in the box and so I took the yellow one that I got as an extra with 8829'
p10420
aS' simonwillems said: The alternate model was great fun too, the pump is cleverly hidden and the crane folds up great between the cab and the loading platform'
p10421
aS' You could easily mod it with a pneumatic claw on the crane, a motor to turn it and a compressor'
p10422
aS' The only flaw was the loading platform which had no floor (only some axles)'
p10423
aS' another reason for the 8460 as favorite set? It\'s got a "real" alternate model, not just a different erm- crane'
p10424
aS" simonwillems said: Thanks so much for reviving my memorie concerning this great set! You're welcome, I consider this as my job! ;-) CP5670 said: "

p10426
aS' There was actually a time when the boxes used to be even stronger'
p10427
aS' I have an old 8859 set and the outer box is made of a hard, styrofoam material, although they probably stopped using that for environmental reasons'
p10428
aS" That's the spirit! I got more than hundred boxes"
p10429
aS' and my 8848 box came with styrofoam too!'
p10430
aS'Thanks for the review'
p10431
aS" *sweet* For it's size and parts count this is a remarkably featured set"
p10432
aS" I don't think I've never seen the alternate model before"
p10433
aS' Personally I prefer 8421 because I think it looks much better and I love the six wheel steering'
p10434
aS' I also love the three segment boom and the transmission; they fit it all in so neatly'
p10435
aS" I realise that it has trouble even holding up itself, but ultimately it doesn't matter as it's not like you are really going to construction work with it"
p10436
aS' What bothers me more about 8421 is the design change in the boom from chainlinks to strings'
p10437
aS' I would try to mod mine but all I have is the prototype picture to base it on'
p10438
aS" and I don't have enough links anyway! :-P BerndDasBrot, on Apr 7 2008, 07:29 AM, said: yeah, somehow I wonderd why only VBBN (thanks!) responded"

aS' Yes, that really sucks'
p10443
aS" Somebody (I haven't got the time to look :-$) on Brickshelf has made a quite good alternate"
p10444
aS' Lego have been a bit inconsistant with alternate models lately'
p10445
aS' The recent tow truck had a good one; I even made both!'
p10446
aS"Great review! While I admit I wasn't into Technic at the time this came out (I was a mere child, give me a break! :-D), I can see now why it was featured so much"
p10447
aS' From the booklets to display stands at toy stores and at my local LEGO center (when it was still around), this thing was everywhere! With your review, I can now truly appreciate all the details of the set'
p10448
aS' I got to admit, I can see the appeal now! That comparison shot you took is amazing'
p10449
aS' I love not only just how it included the little details such as the stabilizers, but also looks incredibly fun to play around with'
p10450
aS' Great set and an even greater review!'
p10451
aS'thanks guys! @ sinner: i hope you refered to 8285 so my answer will match: 8285 is interesting: main model: american styled truck, alternate model: european styled truck'
p10452
aS" I don't think TLG produced many european styled truck"
p10453
aS' EDIT: I just found a wonderful MOC-alternate on brickshelf: 8436 by industrialdesigner'

aS' Dont make that girl hungry or'

aS' YYYYAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! Ho no! Our diner, a giant ant, has gone away! Those giant ants are made in a smooth plastic, in dark red and trans black colour: And here a closer view on the two new hairpieces: The new girl hairpiece is really cute, and Im a bit disappointed by the new man hairpieceThose hair lake some volume But Im really happy to see that TLC has made some new moulds for hairpieces! Its the good part of the theatre lines! So, its a really interesting set because youve got a lot of useful pieces for a city Mocers, with the two new hairpieces without spending a lot of money!

p10515
aS' In this one, which is the same price, you get those ants, a neat tent (Hurray!), a [b]printed[/i] map, a chicken leg, a Castle sword, EF sword, and Pirates sword, a dagger (now in light bley) and a silver frying pan'

p10521
aS"I was already thinking of buying this set, and you've totally convinced me"
p10522

aS"OK! I think, it''s a no-brainer that this is a must-have for pretty much anyone who likes LEGO! It's cheap and a great minifigs & parts pack! I'll be getting at least 1 of these! Here is what I like about it: 1"

aS' Rehashed tent'
p10531
aS' 3'
p10532
aS" Spiders with 6 legs!!! I actually don't really care about the tent and the multi-legged creatures"
p10533
aS' Those go straight into the sorting boxes'
p10534
aS' Perhaps I might use the tent someday for a steampunk MOC of some kind, or a stop-motion film, or maybe some kind of contest'
p10535
aS" Anyway, what's up with that thing that holds the katana, the sword, and the saber? It's in the airplane set too! Is it perhaps one of the treasures of the new movie or is it something Indy takes with him everywhere in this film? 44However, nice pics, nice review! Thanks, dude!

p10536
aS'Mhm'
p10537
aS'I really need this set! There are various things Im interested in: the minifigs (hey, I still have no Indiana Jones figs!), the new hairpieces, a gold katana, a dark bley pirate cutlass (is this the first one?), a dark bley knife (could be useful'

p10552
aS'Set ref: 7625 Name: River Chase Number of minifigs: 4 Number of pieces: unknown Price: 22,90 A general view of the set: Weve got an amphibious vehicle, a small boat, an observation post and a dark green croco (so beautiful! )'
p10553
aS' For the figs, weve got Indy of course, Marion and two Russian soldiers, nothing special here'
p10554
aS' In the back of the tree, there is a box, to put some things: The amphibious vehicle is very nice! The proportions are really great (not too big, not too small) and there are a lot of details everywhere, like the propeller: A back view: An inside view: The small boat is a dark grey Zodiac, but the details are nice too, giving it a retro look, in the same way of all the Indy vehicles: The outpost has a net to permit to the bad guys to capture some nice guys and girls But it seems that the girl Marion is scared of the nice croco! So Indy comes and help her pushing the Technic axle with this round inversed tiles, which push out the net and capture the croco'
p10555
aS' Now Marion feels happier! And she takes a can of oil and whacks the poor croco, without defences! Who has said Marion is a nice girl? So, Ive bought this set like an add on to my city'
p10556
aS' In fact, the elements of this set can easily be integrated in a town layout'
p10557
aS' I plan to use the outpost for my forest section, and the amphibious vehicle is always a nice touch of originality in a layout'
p10558
aS' Yes you can use all those military things without creating an army in a layout: just put the violent parts out, and youve got nice things, like a biologist car in the case of the amphibious vehicle!'
p10559
aS"Great set, i'll definitely get it"
p10560
aS' Is there any sign of flesh on the soldiers, like at the collars?'

aS' About the jerry cans, I like how they give me more pistols'
p10615
aS' This may be the only Indy set I get from this batch'
p10616
aS" I'll just have to deal with the fleshie heads"
p10617
aS' (Exchange them for yellow'
p10618
aS') Like Stealth Hunter said'
p10619
aS' This will be good for army building'
p10620
aS' Silent Help'
p10621
aS'im glad they change the torso form the prototype'
p10622
aS'Set ref: 7626 Name: Jungle Cutter Number of minifigs: 4 Number of pieces: unknown Price: 39,99 A general view of the set: Weve got 5 giant ants, two Russian soldiers, a General, Indy of course, 3 trees, a small entrance of a cave, and the debroussaillor vehicle (I dont know the English name of it)'
p10623
aS' You cant enter into the cave, because there is a spider web with its spiderUnless Unless you know how the mechanism works and the spider web go up And reveals a case with diamonds and accessories'
p10624
aS' A closer view on the mechanism (which is simple but works well), and you can also see the difference, or maybe the same, size of a spider and a giant ant! And Ive always thought that those spiders were very big compared to the minifigs! So those ants are really giant! Poor small frog! The three trees with the entrance make a nice jungle layout! Dont speak too loud, you will wake up the soldier Dont worry for him, he will be waken up by the vehicle before being eaten by those giant ants! A front view, making the vehicle really menacing! A back view: Push the red part from the back and there are two parts that fall down from the vehicle'
p10625
aS' I dont know why The movie will clarify this I think And here you can see how the two big circular blades turn when you push the vehicle Simple but effective! Run Indy, run! This set is really nice'
p10626
aS' The playability of the different elements is great, the colour scheme is nice too (I like those dark green tree parts!)'
p10627
aS' The vehicle is really impressive without being too big and its very well details! In general the designers of the Indy sets have made a really nice works, with a lot of efforts in all those details everywhere! Ive got some project for this set, to integrate it in my city'
p10628
aS' Im a city mocer, and not an Indy fan'
p10629
aS' So I dont have bought the temple, the bigger set of the series, because it has nothing special for me in term of part selections or in the design, in relation with the town theme, and because my supermarket doesnt have it yet! So, we are waiting for a member to review it and make the part 4'
p10630
aS'I like the creatures in this very much, and it is good to see the vehicle from different angles'
p10631
aS' Thank you I think I shall buy this'
p10632
aS'I CANT WAIT FOR THESE!'
p10633
aS'Oh, man, thanks for the review! IMO, this looks like the best set in the new Indy line! Do you have any better pics of the Colonel?'
p10634
aS'Excellent review Alex'
p10635
aS' Thanks for sharing'
p10636
aS" I can't wait to buy this set once available"
p10637
aS' I really like the dark green leaf pieces'
p10638
aS' I like the cave/temple which will look great in my Jungle Diorama'
p10639
aS' Blending the dark green and light green works well for the vehicle'
p10640
aS' Overall, a neat little set'
p10641
aS'Great review, thanks for that'
p10642
aS' I love almost everything about this set'
p10643
aS' The ants, commies, general (can we please get a shot of his face?), dark green, treads, foliage and other creatures'
p10644
aS" Great stuff, i'll have to get it on sale though"
p10645
aS' Batbrick Away!'
p10646
aS'This is a great set!!!!!! It is probably my favourite Indy so so far! Great reveiw! Although the set is great the price is greater have to get it on sale'
p10647
aS'Wow in the protype pics I kept thinking this thing looked lame; a boat on treads with saw blades? But this is definetly something I want now'
p10648
aS' lots of great plant and animal parts'
p10649
aS' And looks like plenty of wheels with those treads; its just begging to be made into a propor tank'
p10650
aS'This one is my favorite from the bunch'
p10651
aS' Thanks for the time spent in making a review'
p10652
aS'Great review, thanks a lot for all the pics'
p10653
aS' I agree that this is probably the nicest set of the Indy 4 wave'
p10654
aS' So much dark green and I love all the plant pieces'
p10655
aS" It's been ages since we've had enough pieces in a regular release to build nice forests so it's great to see 11 of the dark green leaves in one set and all the vines! The design of the cutter looks very solid and brick built as well"
p10656
aS' Giant ants are great looking too'
p10657
aS"A great, detailed review for an excellent set! I love the Jungle Cutter vehicle itself, and all the dark green! It's great to have the trees and cave entrance; you can never have enough extras! The figs are nice too; two Russian soldiers, the cool-looking general (I think his name is Dovchenko or something) and the repeated-but-still-nice Indy with RPG"
p10658
aS" Thanks again, looks like I'll be picking this up along with Jungle Duel"
p10659
aS' (By the way, I think this set is called Jungle Cutter)'
p10660
aS'Wow those trees look so weak compared to those enormous blades'
p10661
aS" Anyway, a high-possibility-and-appeal-to-us-compulsive-LEGO-shoppers set, so, I'll try to get it, which means I'll obsesively look until i find"
p10662
aS' Deforestation of puny trees, ON!'
p10663
aS'Thanks for this fantastic review, Alex! Those trees are a neat add on to any jungle, as is that sweet cave'
p10664
aS' But the main part of this set, the Jungle Cutter, man, that is wicked! Packed with that awesome dark green and with those wonderful treads, not to mention the smoothly spinning buzz saws'
p10665
aS" However, this set's a tad overpriced in my opinion, and looking through the instructions they have that crazy colour syndrome again, using blue, yellow and red parts in the internal build"
p10666
aS' Still, thanks for this sweet review with neat pics! *thumbup* ~Peace'
p10667
aS'Thanks for the review alex I agree that this is the best set of KotCS sets (although the airplane comes quite close'
p10668
aS" Although I'm not too fond of the trees, the cave is good, and the jungle cutter is brilliant"
p10669
aS" Plenty of great features, and very detailed, with much of the engine showing and a decent cockpit (if that's the right word"
p10670
aS' The general and the two Soviets are great too (could we have a close-up pic of them please? ), good to see that neither torso has exposed fleshy skin like the Nazis'
p10671
aS' As said though, it is quite a pricy set, I was expecting it to be just over the price of Race for the Stolen Treasure'
p10672
aS' Great set, thanks again, alex!'
p10673
aS"Here some close-up pics of the Russian soldiers and the General : And I know that you have seen that I don't have put the stickers on"
p10674
aS'Ahhhhh now this swamp vehicle looks great to me, when i first heard lego were making it i was worried that it would be a poor version'
p10675
aS" However im pleased to see that it's not, even though i'm not a great fan of those treads"
p10676
aS" The trees don't really add anything to the set which is a shame, still the parts are welcome at least"
p10677
aS' The entrance is good though it could do with being bigger, but i guess we can moc that'
p10678
aS' I really like the commie general, he looks like a real bad megablocks'
p10679
aS"Great review again Alex !! Same question (in case you didn't se it in my reply to the other set): where did you get those new sets ?? I really love that set !! Its called Jungle Cutter The trees are really cool and make a great adition to it IMO"
p10680
aS' That temple entrance or monument is really cool !! Those Bionicle parts do make fantastic vegetation !! I totally forgot about that green frog !! Thats cool , those are so cute !! 5 more ants is great !! The vehicle look really sharp (ah ah ah)'
p10681
aS" 2 more commies yeay !! That officer is really freaky actually !! Could have been a high rank under Pol Pot's regime in the S21"
p10682
aS" Yeay looks more asian than russian IMO Now its time for my grips: * same bloody rant about Indy !! * I haven't read the instructions before but once again there are so many parts in crap colours that need to be changed Look at all the crap red and yellow in there !! I will need to look for those parts before buying the set like I always do !! Mod while building On !! I am really soimpressed with that Indy line !! I sincerely hope it will have a long and healthy life !!"

p10703
aS'looks great'
p10704
aS'What a lovely set! I think I have to put this on my wishlist,just for that beautiful woodcutting tank thingie'
p10705
aS' 2008 is gonna get expensive for me'
p10706
aS'the thing and the set is called jungle cutter and the reason the front pops off is because indy blows it up with a bazooka incase you wanted to know'
p10707
aS' thanks for the nice review'
p10708
aS'What a marvelous diversity of plant parts, very nice MFs and a cool and detailed harvester'
p10709
aS' That conventionalized cave with its neat opening features also very well done'
p10710
aS' Thanks for that fine review of a pretty cool set, alex'
p10711
aS'This is the 3rd review, that i had read'
p10712
aS" It's very tempting to fly over and get those sets from there"
p10713
aS' Because, i may need to wait for some months before it arrived'
p10714
aS' It seemed we will have a new small little creature to add into the ranks'
p10715
aS' These "Red Ants" is cute and of course looks nasty too'
p10716
aS' Haha'
p10717
aS' I love those trees, foilage and plants very very much'
p10718
aS' It can be used for my MOC and is good for any "Green" project related expansion'
p10719
aS' I love it'
p10720
aS' About the vehicle, i find it abit wierd'
p10721
aS' It seemed too big in the set-up'
p10722
aS' Hehe, but still i love this set'
p10723
aS' Mainly, i will get it for the green parts'
p10724
aS"Here's a review of the second largest set in the Dragon Masters subtheme for castle month, Dark Dragon's Den! Figs: The set comes with 3 Dragon knights, two of which have the dragon wings on their helmets(Sad thing is, one of my knights was missing the left wing on the helmet)"
p10725
aS" There are also the definitive dragon, Wiz the wizard (or Majisto if you prefer)two horses, and a hawk( try to find him in each picture!) The set: there's a large spot under the mountain for the dragon to guard the treasure chest"
p10726
aS' The chest has 2 red and green 1x1 circles in it'
p10727
aS' Another gate in the back, along with a door for knights'
p10728
aS' The right side of the mountain has a ladder and a removable rock face'
p10729
aS' The left side has some stairs leading up to the top'
p10730
aS' I love this tree design'
p10731
aS' simple yet effective'
p10732
aS' A shot of the top- Hey, what are you doing?!? NO!! Throw him in the dungeon! Overall: This set when first released in 1993 was priced at $43USD, although that might just be because of the Juniorised pieces (6 BURPs!)'
p10733
aS" It's a fun set that provides excellent playability"
p10734
aS' If you can find it at a $20-$30 price point, pick it up'
p10735
aS' Overall grade: 8/10 Edited by KimT, 10 August 2008 - 01:33 PM'
p10736
aS'This is around the time that many consider the decline of castle, in which point I somewhat agree, but admittedly it still looks like a very playable set, and the tree is very well done'
p10737
aS' Thank you for the review!'
p10738
aS'Thanks every much for the review! I remember having this set, and making really terrible stop-motion movies with it'
p10739
aS' Very playable'
p10740
aS" This brings back lot's of fond memories! Thanks! Majisto ON!"
p10741
aS'Ah, the wonderful Dragon Knight (Or was it Dragon Masters?) sets'
p10742
aS' I personally preferred the Black Knights, but these guys still had some awesome sets! Thanks for this review, this looks like a neat little set, although those modern stairs look a little out of place'
p10743
aS' That tree design is indeed a neat one, I remember having that in one dark Forestmen set I got'
p10744
aS' The interior sure is roomy'
p10745
aS" May I suggest for future review you photograph the set on a cleared table, that way you won't get distracted by the clutter in the background and can focus on the main part of the image, the set"
p10746
aS' ~Peace'
p10747
aS'This is probably one of my favourite sets and/or one of the sets which I wish I owned'

p10749
aS"Yay, go Dragon Masters! I have to agree with iamded, I do like the Black Knights sets better for their design ( betrayal! ), however, the Dragon Knights are just awesome, 'cause they have dragons! This is a nice set, with some awesome minifigs and a nice overall design"

aS' I wish I had it'
p10751
aS' Go Masters!'
p10752
aS"Agent Rick: You're definately the Dragon Master around these parts"
p10753
aS' What a great little set'
p10754
aS' I really like the classic dragon which reminds me of a similar style used for the Lego crocodiles'
p10755
aS' And the dungeon is pretty slick too'
p10756
aS' I like the use of the large gates plus the doors'
p10757
aS' Plus the set contains the blue wizard'
p10758
aS' Awesome! Great review'

aS'Great Classic Dragon Den! I love the old green dragons very much! There were my fave'

aS' I love these theme very much after the Black Knights era'

aS'this was the last castle set i got before my dark age'
p10765
aS' really liked it although the big rock parts looked really bad ( i am kind of used to them now) unfortunately i lost the little wand'
p10766
aS' and i never understood who is "good" and who is "bad" does the wizard own the dragon? well they dont seem to be enemies but isnt the dragon supposed to be evil??'
p10767
aS'the wizard somehow "controls" the dragons i think, like, for example the wizard of the new castle line does with the undead skeletons'
p10768
aS" but i think it isn't sure that the dragon master's wizard is evil"
p10769
aS' as it is still unclear which factions of the older castle series are "good" or "bad"'

p10773
aS' Maybe because they were dark grey and dark grey pieces seemed a bit hard to come by at the time'
p10774
aS' I always assumed that the dragon was, sort of, the mascot of the Dragon Masters'
p10775
aS" The wizard was there to keep him under control so he wouldn't turn on them"
p10776
aS' I always figured that the wizard was working with the Dragon Master King, and they were fighting against the Royal Knights (the dudes with the lion faces on their torsos), or whatever they were called'
p10777
aS' I like this set a lot'
p10778
aS' I think the castle theme declined after the Dragon Masters and Royal Knights themes were discontinued'
p10779
aS' The new knights never really took the cake'
p10780
aS" It's funny, but it seems, to me anyways, that when the Lego Minifigs lost their regular smile/smirk faces (whether they were masked by a beard or not), that's when Lego began to decline"
p10781
aS'a bit'
p10782
aS' The Dragon Masters had their vicious faces and all, but they still had that smile/smirk underneath their rough exteriors'
p10783

p10784
aS'less confident'
p10785
aS'I own this set and I think its a great for a smaller fortress building'
p10786
aS' There is a good selection of mini figs, the BURPS do detract somewhat from the set, but they do make it feel as if its in a large cave'
p10787
aS' The cloth flags that are included are really nice and mine have lasted a long time'
p10788
aS"The 8291 Dirt Bike comes from a long line of Technic bikes, and I think it's the best ever"
p10789
aS" It looks great, and it's fun to ride around in the house"
p10790
aS' I hoped to find a figure the right size for it, but none of mine would fit'
p10791
aS' Unlike a lot of Technic models, it looks good from all angles'
p10792
aS' Considering the size of the model it has a complicated way of connecting the engine to the wheel'
p10793
aS' The rear shocks are just the right stiffness'
p10794
aS'and they have a good amount of travel'
p10795
aS' I thought these shocks were new'
p10796
aS' I need to get out more'
p10797
aS' Functions: Shocks: Two front, one stiffer one in the rear'
p10798
aS' Drivetrain: 2 piston engine linked to the rear wheel via gears and a chainlink'
p10799
aS' Steering: Yes it does'
p10800
aS' Stand: Retractable'
p10801
aS" For the price, size and subject, what else could be added? 10/10 Parts: Considering that it has three shocks and a 40 chainlinks it's a great set for parts"
p10802
aS' Some hard to use large parts are included, but they are not overused'
p10803
aS" The usage of the green does limit part usage somewhat though, and I'll be struggling to find a use for those wheels for anything other than a motorbike"
p10804
aS' 8/10 Price: At $39'
p10805
aS"99 AUD for 248 parts it isn't the best value set"
p10806
aS' The US price is $25'
p10807
aS'00 which is somewhat better'
p10808
aS' It does have some more complicated parts however'
p10809
aS' 7/10 Looks: Lego seems to be moving away from the see-though look for Technic sets and this is a good example of it'
p10810
aS" I'm not a big fan of fairings but I think they work great in this set as a fuel tank"
p10811
aS' 8/10 Fudge: This set was great for me as I have never had a Technic bike'
p10812
aS' However for those that want this for just parts or have other bikes it could be a hard sell'
p10813
aS" The alternate model (a chopper) is a complete rebuild (which I didn't make), and it's great that Lego have been including these most of the time lately"

p10817
aS' I like the use of fairings on this bike'
p10818
aS' The only thing I really don\'t like about the Technics bikes in general, is the "clumsy" design of the chaindrive'
p10819
aS' It sticks way to much out to the side'
p10820
aS' If they made a really big bike model, it would be more in place with this chain drive'
p10821
aS" I'm not sure if it wouldn't be possible to design a shaft drive to the rear wheel, ala BMW style"
p10822
aS' But the green "Kawasaki" look great with the front and rear suspension'
p10823
aS' I have the Street Bike, 8420, a somewhat larger and more complicated set, and will probably add the motocross bike to my collection soon'

p10834
aS' um, thank you, Sinner'

p10836
aS'I have just finished building this set'
p10837
aS' I was a bit disappointed with the amount of bricks when they were out on my table, but the final model is really nice and totally makes up for that'
p10838

p10872
aS"the problem is that it's too tight and it doesn't rotate as freely anymore"

aS"I wasn't very interested in this set at first"
p10888
aS' It seemed to be just a nice looking truck with a small motor'
p10889
aS' but when I found out it had a transmission I changed my mind! Here is the transmission'
p10890
aS' It allows the single motor to be used for two functions'
p10891
aS' This system has been around for a while, and Lego seem to be using it more and more'
p10892
aS' The Transmission Driving Ring alone (the red circle) goes for $5-15 USD on BrickLink, and you also need the Catch and Clutch Gear so I have been buying sets that have them instead'
p10893
aS' I now have enough parts to make a Supercar gearbox'
p10894
aS' (I bet a new supercar comes out next year now'
p10895
aS') This is the gear that rotates the arm'
p10896
aS' Note the colour of the 24 tooth gear; it seems to be a new gear trend'
p10897
aS' A lot of work has been put into this truck looking real'
p10898
aS" Personally I think they went too far as the truck seems to have been designed for a tilting cab, but it's disabled to prevent breaking the front"
p10899
aS' Bottom of the transmission'
p10900
aS' The bottom shaft lifts the arm'
p10901
aS' Note that there are more dark grey gears'
p10902
aS' The motor fits in very well also'
p10903
aS' The bottom of the arm'
p10904
aS' I was surprised by the usage of a 12 Tooth Bevel to link with the 36 Tooth Double Bevel as I had never seen that done before'
p10905
aS' As you can see there is no room for any drive train'
p10906
aS' Standard steering for a recent technic truck'
p10907
aS' There is a hand-of-god at the cab top that links via two Knob Wheels'
p10908
aS' It looks good from the back'
p10909
aS' You can also see the white Clutch that connects the transmission to the motor to avoid burnouts'
p10910
aS' It goes decently high, and can go a bit higher if you use the crane arm'
p10911
aS' Compared to last years fire truck'
p10912
aS" (If I didn't buy the fire truck for half price I would have been annoyed that Lego brought out what is almost a motorised version of the same set"
p10913
aS') Functions: Cherry Picker Arm: Motorised rotate and lift that links to a motor via a transmission and anti-burnout clutch'
p10914
aS' Steering: Rack and pinion controlled via a hand-of-god linked by Knob Wheels Doors: Open and close'
p10915
aS" Good functionality that works well, but I wish they made the cab lift and I'm a bit sick of the lame fairing door trick"
p10916
aS' 7/10 Parts: Motor, battery box, transmission, clutch, practical wheels, only two fairings, compact turntable'
p10917

aS' The US price is $60'
p10921

p10922

p10923
aS"8/10 Looks: I'd buy this for the looks alone! 9/10 Fudge: The functions work well and I llked it more than I thought I would"
p10924
aS" Oddly mine seemed to be missing a Axle Pin with Friction, but since it includes extra parts for the alternate model I didn't mind using one of my spares"
p10925
aS" On the subject of the alternate model, it is a dump truck which is made out to be a total re-build, but it isn't"
p10926
aS' It could have easily been done like Super Street Sensation was, but Lego have probably determined that instructions like that confuse people'

p10941
aS" That's always good to see"
p10942
aS" I'll probably pass it up though until the price falls a bit"
p10943
aS' The overall design is a bit too studless for my liking (I think the 8275 bulldozer has a much better balance of studded and studless pieces), and the wheels somehow look too small to me'
p10944
aS' I also have something of a backlog at the moment; I still need to pick up that bulldozer along with the 8421 mobile crane (on ebay)'

p10977
aS"99 Out of all the Indy 4 sets, this one seems to cop the most flak - which may account for the fact that the other 3 were reviewed weeks ago and this one has sat, unloved and alone, waiting for someone to turn their eye upon it (or, y'know, buy it)"
p10978
aS" Luckily I'm a sucker for spooky old temples, filled with devilish traps and hidden treasures, hissing fountains and overgrown foliage, creepy skeletons and crumbling stonework, so here it is: Indiana Jones 7627, Temple of the Crystal Skull"
p10979
aS" Part 1: The Figs First off, the figs - 6 humans and 4 skellies (or should that be skullies? ) Indy, Mutt, Irina, and that sneery Russian guy that's in the 2 smaller sets"

aS' Aha! What have we here - two natives'
p10982
aS' I wonder if hair is a sign of power in this culture, since one guy is completely bald and the other one has the most extraordinarily luxurious black mullet'

aS' Fashion conscious! (Note in the background the paws of the fearsome black jungle panther, ie my cat, curious as to see what the tribe was up to'
p10986

p10992

aS" I'm sure there's a military expert around here who can tell us exactly what it is supposed to be"
p10995
aS' The treads are nice, but the rest of it is a bit thrown together'
p10996
aS' You can tell they wanted to keep the dark green colour scheme but the budget only allowed them 5 parts to do so '
p10997
aS' All in all, a mixed bag with the figs'
p10998
aS' 4 repeats from the cheaper sets which means we have one new native figure and the crystal skullies'
p10999
aS' There are heaps of the old-skool skele heads scattered around the sets so those that prefer can replace the skullies with ordinary skellies'

p11010
aS" This one, recycled from the 05 Police HQ and 06 Hospital, is much better in design than the King Leo's Castle one as the different heights and asymmetry make it look much more like a natural piece of ground"

p11021
aS" I'm of two minds about this"
p11022
aS" I kind of prefer the palette to be a bit subtler, but I can see that a playset designed for kids isn't going to sell bucketloads all tastefully done in shades of tan with lashings of dark-green foliage"
p11023
aS" There's a huge amount of dark red in this set, which is always a welcome colour, but I'm not convinced it quite works with the 2 shades of tan on offer here"
p11024
aS" On the plus side, there's also a huge amount of dark tan in ordinary 2x2 bricks, tiles, plates and 1x1 and 1x2x3 slopes, which is great for anyone wanting to stock up"
p11025
aS" Let's take a closer look"
p11026
aS" I'll do this roughly in order of the build itself: a) The big scary face"
p11027
aS' This is a simple, fun build and very effective at projecting menace at the temple entrance'
p11028
aS' It actually detaches very easily from the temple (as pictured on the box art) to allow easier access to the inside'
p11029
aS" The eyes are flick-fire missiles, with Scary Face's hair conveniently providing ammo refills should you run out"
p11030
aS' All in all, from me'
p11031

p11036
aS' A little red stair'
p11037
aS' I really like these 2 stickers though - very intricate'
p11038
aS' The staircase leads to what I like to think of as the Crystal Skull Transmogrification Chamber'
p11039
aS" Now, I know nothing about the movie except that it's supposed to be have a kind of 50s B-movie plot rumoured to feature (look away, spoiler-haters)"
p11040
aS' aliens'
p11041
aS' These weird, creepy gold chairs look made from the bones of aliens if you ask me, with their strange vertebrae and silver claws'
p11042
aS" It wouldn't surprise me if bringing these aliens back to life was part of the plot of the movie"
p11043
aS" hence the crystal skull? I guess we'll find out May 22"
p11044
aS' In any case, transforming aliens clearly like a disco whirl as when you pull the handle, the whole of this assembly spins giddily around'
p11045
aS" A very clever and simple trick - it's basically just a wheel under the platform but the effect is great"
p11046
aS' Also under here is a bottomless pit (stickered)'
p11047
aS' I would very much expect a villian to be thrown down it at some point'
p11048

p11049
aS' These chairs are REALLY uncomfortable'
p11050
aS'" NB'
p11051
aS' I am really, really over those pearl gold 1x2 roof corner slopes which started popping up in the 2006 Castle range, infected Exo-Force and have now spread here'
p11052
aS' Can we please have these in a different colour? Or a different pearl gold piece? Pretty please? ( c) Left tower (looking from the front) A small tower with a trans clear gem'
p11053
aS' (d) Right tower Waterfall with booby trap'
p11054
aS" I like the sticker, it's very cartoony, which fits with the set somehow"
p11055
aS' When you turn the wheel, flick fire missiles spray out and hit whoever is on the stairs'
p11056
aS' Both towers have a trap where if you move the skull, another one pops out from the dragon mouth'
p11057
aS" (e) Central turret thing This thing is kind of annoying and doesn't really sit or work well"
p11058
aS" It's kind of like a laser beam sending messages to space, I guess"
p11059
aS' As the central dome rises, the two plates peel away'
p11060
aS" I find it is a little bit tight to work smoothly and the two plates doesn't really sit well together at the top"
p11061
aS' Maybe I just need to rebuild it'
p11062
aS" I'm sure this will also be explained in the movie"
p11063
aS" (f) Final trap - the stair that isn't there The final trap is at the front - as Indy goes down the staircase, you can push the red heads and all the 1x8 bley bricks come tumbling down"
p11064
aS' Simple and works well'
p11065
aS" (g) Alternate view Here's how it looks as pictured on the box with the head removed"
p11066
aS' As you can see, this allows better access to the centre of the temple'
p11067
aS' As you can see, sadly there is nothing actually interesting there except a staircase to the turret and 2 dark tan slopes which are just stuck there and look a little out of place'
p11068
aS" I mean, come on, everything else has a splash of dark red and gold! Your Destination: Nowhere! Part 4: In Conclusion So after all those endless pics, what about the set itself? CONS:As a playset, 7627 doesn't quite make sense"
p11069
aS' Admittedly, the traps that are there are well-designed and unobtrusive'

aS" On the other hand, there's a great big whopping entrance at the front - but I wasn't sure if the figs are supposed to sneak in through the backdoor and go up the spiral staircase and past the waterfall (as shown in the box art) or if they were meant to end up in the golden skull room"
p11071
aS" The middle area doesn't really connect with anything, nor does the giant space turret"
p11072
aS" It may be that some of these questions are answered in the film, but whereas with 7624, 7625 and 7626 I could at least picture a story myself (eg with River Chase is fairly obvious what's happening - a chase down a river with a croc and a communist staking them out)!, the Temple set is a little all over the place"
p11073
aS' The design feels a little off to me - not really bad but not really great either'
p11074
aS' PROS: On the plus side, the natives and crystal skulls themselves are great'
p11075
aS' At 900+ pieces, this is also a great parts pack for dark tan, dark red, plant pieces, gold oddments etc'
p11076
aS' I especially love the baseplate in that shade'
p11077
aS' I like the overall shape of the temple - a big staircase with secret nooks and crannies'
p11078
aS' The build is reasonably interesting and there are some clever tricks with the traps'
p11079
aS" But upon reflection I shouldn't have to sell this set - it should be able to sell itself! As I said before, I'm a huge fan of dark, mysterious old temples so for that I have to give it some love"
p11080
aS' It reminds me of the big old Adventurers sets and the whiff of nostalgia is itself a powerful intoxicant'
p11081
aS" However, for the price Lego is selling it in Australia/ Europe/ Canada I couldn't recommend it as a must-buy for full price when the smaller sets in this series are themselves so good"

aS" Note the backs of the crystal head have a plume-sized hole - or maybe that's just where they injected the blue brain-plastic"
p11085
aS" Spooky! I love these skulls, I wasn't sold from the initial pics but they have a very creepy smile and the head shape is just"

p11098
aS' And is the armour the skellie is wearing pearl gold? Thanks again, I look forward to the rest of the review EDIT: The dark tan baseplate is in fact very nice Although the fact that you have to put stickers on it is a real downer'

p11119
aS" I've been wanting to see this set in detail since it debuted at the conventions"
p11120
aS' I have to say that, on the one hand, I agree that the minifigures, the crystal skulls, and the colors are great (I even like the waterfall), but, on the other, I kind of think that the set itself is a disappointment'
p11121
aS" It looks like they tried to accommodate design and playability needs, but really didn't come through on either"
p11122
aS" So, as you pointed out, the mid section doesn't really fit in with the other parts, and the trap sequence doesn't really flow, either"
p11123
aS' But, perhaps your right, and all will be answered in the film'
p11124
aS' I was surprised at just how empty the temple looked in the photo taken from above'
p11125
aS' They really should have gone the extra mile and made the temple look more like a temple, and not worry so much about the action features'
p11126
aS' Eh, but so it goes'
p11127
aS" But, I, too, am a sucker for tombs and temples, so I won't be able to pass it up"
p11128
aS' Archaeology on!'
p11129
aS"Damn, you've convinced me to get it now, thanks for the review, tan is my favourite colour in Lego! Batbrick Away!"

p11131
aS" I can't wait! This looks like a great set, for me at least"
p11132
aS' I too am a great fan of spooky old temples, they are such fun'
p11133

p11147
aS' The waterfall is a reall cool sticker, and the flick fire missiles are quite interesting'
p11148
aS' Another point of interest: There are seven of the new flick fire missiles overall, if anyone cares'

aS" Great review! Now I'm really truly convinced that I'm gonna buy this set"
p11172
aS" My faith was a little wobbly, but its benn restored Anyway, I just wanted to point out that the temple's entrance might actually be the turret thing"
p11173
aS' If you watch the teaser, there are some very similair stone pillars surrounded by sand (there are 4 not 2 though ) and when they close up it looks like all our characters are sucked into the sand and magically appear underground going through some stone plates(which act like steps to go down) that dissapear'
p11174
aS" So, in theory those steps beneath the turret are actualy the entrance, and I'm asumming from this picture That the steps with 1x8 bricks with the dragon heads at the end lead us of somewhere else"
p11175
aS" All in all this temple looks like a mixed up version of the real temple, which is fine by me (SIDENOTE: I'm not sure but based on minifig inclusion, either Lego was cheap or Colonel Dovchenko is dead by the time Irina and her goons reach the temple, I'll wait till I see the movie"

aS'I know that alex54 had already reviewed this set beforehand, but I wanted to give my 2 cents (it is really more like $1'
p11187
aS"50) on this set I bought from toys 'r' us on friday (guess what, the price had not been increased by a dollar like all other sets, )"
p11188
aS" This is my first review of a set ever, don't be too mean"
p11189
aS" 1) Box It captures the potential (I don't know how the scene plays out"
p11190
aS' for now ) action of the scene nicely and is very pleasing, good job TLC '
p11191
aS' On the back it shows some of the play features of the set and a net little comic'
p11192
aS' Indiana Jones seems to be surprisingly calm considering that he is about to be captured under a net and attacked by a snake (the thing he fears most)'
p11193
aS' 1a) comic not much to say on this'
p11194
aS' 1b) screw up At the top of the box, both "Russian Guards" have the same grining face, in the set one has the generic bad guy face from 7620'
p11195
aS' 2) Contents The box opens up to reveal a quartet of bags, an un-crumpled manual (YAY!), and a sticker sheet (BOO!) 2a) DSS Yoda said every for of rambling imaginable about this accursed item, I have nothing to say'
p11196
aS' Meh'
p11197
aS' 3) Minifigs The only thing that has not really been discussed about the figs that you get in this set is that Marion has a slightly new torso'
p11198
aS' 4) Parts of interest When I opened up the baggies, these were the components that grabbed my attention'
p11199
aS' A DARK GREEN alligator, a net piece that I Know has appeared in sets before hand ( I needed it for a MOC I am working on), some raft part that is probably very old, a ladder with two pairs of hindges, and a DARK brown version of this part'
p11200
aS' 4) Build (amphibious vehicle) This I one of the more enjoyable builds of the new line'
p11201
aS' But that is just my opinion'
p11202
aS' You start of with some thing very simple'
p11203
aS' By the end of the next page, it starts to bulk up More detail'
p11204
aS' Beginning to look like a car'
p11205
aS' 4a) Build (rear attachment) Bulk it up and add Taillights'
p11206
aS' Done'
p11207
aS' Slap it on to the main vehicle'

aS' 4b) Build (Front attachment) I am running out of things to say'
p11209
aS' Bulk it up'
p11210
aS' Add some detail'
p11211
aS' Add a gun and headlights'
p11212
aS' And attach to the rest to get the completed vehicle'
p11213
aS' Add stickers'
p11214
aS' I honestly think that the amphibious vehicle looks much better with the stickers than without'
p11215
aS' 5) Build (boat) This build goes by rather quickly and adds to the playability of the final set'
p11216
aS' Base'
p11217
aS' Apply clamps'
p11218
aS' Add more to engine'
p11219

aS' I love how Lego slips in the product number into their stickers'

p11224
aS' But I find my self liking it more and more for some odd and inexplicable reason'
p11225
aS' That tan 6x6 will most likely see use in a pirate themed vinigete soon (not mine )'
p11226
aS' Install net-launcher'
p11227
aS' You spend the next two pages building this'
p11228

aS' (our commie friend seems to like coffee a lot) Second branch'
p11231
aS' 3rd'
p11232
aS" (a wee bit to much on the coffee there, don't you think?) Final step"

p11235

p11236

aS': 6395 Name: Victory Lap Racetrack Number of minifigs: 13 (!!) Number of pieces: unknown Release Year: 1988 Starting with the beautiful old Legoland box: Front: Back, with some cool alternative models: Inside: We continue with the great minifigs, which are not less than 13! I don\'t think there is any city set with more figures, is there? Civilians: Race Crew & Assistant Personnel: Drivers: All: Here\'s a overview of the whole set: The "Rescue Rig" (don\'t exactly know how to call it) with trailer: The score board & Traffic Lights, which would be one of the details i love the most about this set: The next sweet detail, the Camera + Cameraman! Of course we have a doc, if there is some kind of accident: The pit stop boxes, i love the small tool-holder with the axle and wheel behind it: The control room high above the racetrack: Ready to go?!! That was it all in all,all i can say is, if you see this set anywhere on ebay ore somewhere else, get it!'

p11284
aS'Thanks for this review! You have reviewed my most favourite town set of all times, I am so happy to own this one'
p11285
aS' I actually is a story to go along with it: In the summer of 1998 I went on holiday with my parents to the country of Luxembourg, in the city of Wiltz we encountered a small toystore which still had this set for sale, (9 years after the release!)'
p11286
aS' I did not had the sufficient amount of money to buy the set and had to leave it at the store, I was practically in tears'
p11287
aS' Four years later we passed through Luxembourg and I remembered the city and the store'
p11288
aS' We made a detour and stopped by the same store'
p11289
aS' Every other old set was sold, the only one remaining was this one! I bought it immediately and treasured it ever since'
p11290
aS' I use the baseplates a lot in my cities, they serve well as roads with parking spaces next to them'
p11291
aS' This was the first set I owned which had the huge 6x24 plates in them, I remember my surprise when seeing plates of such enourmous lenght'

p11295
aS' I must admit, this is what I called a "real classic" race prix I miss those cute sweet little race cars which is able to contain a mini-fig'
p11296
aS' Furthermore, this set offers 4 race cars and 13 mini-figures In addition, if town collectors remember, the car number tiles are printed instead of using stickers'
p11297

p11309
aS' like so many other sets'

aS' And this one is still a dream'
p11311
aS' I really like the design of this set, it looks really complete, with some nice details'

p11318
aS' This trailer is always ready to go and was only used in a slecect number of sets'
p11319
aS'Thank you very much for that fine review of a really classic and wonderful racing set! And I really wish that TLC would continue with showing some great alternative models on the back of the boxes'
p11320
aS' just imagine on!'
p11321
aS"Hello all, I don't believe there has been a review of this set yet, so I wanted to take this opportunity"
p11322
aS' Up for review today is 8160 Cruncher Block and Racer X as part of Batbrick and iamded reviews: Here is the box, I have to say I love the art on it'
p11323
aS" It's very colourful and makes the truck look a lot less crap than it does on the box"
p11324
aS' Plus, you have to love the "Missile launching action" bit right, am I right? Why are you all staring at me? And here is the back'
p11325
aS' Pretty generic, but shows some nice details and so forth'
p11326
aS' Oh dear! In turning around the box have I killed myself AND iamded!? Okey dokey, up first is the best part of the entire set: the minifigs! Racer X is wonderful, though coming with a boring Bruce Wayne face'
p11327
aS' But it is Cruncher Block, his lady Driver Taejo that really shine'
p11328
aS" Look at those awesome suits! The cool faces! Taejo has a ripped shirt! Now up is the first building part of the set, with me and iamded looking rather slick in X's car"
p11329
aS" While I'm not a big fan of yellow, it is very nice, and slopes in an underused colour is better than no slopes at all: Front view, the new windshields are fantastic: While a very cool car, it is rather silly of TLC to give us the exact same one we got in the smaller set"
p11330
aS" I didn't get the smaller set with this car, so I'm still happy, but it is a bad marketing move: Sorry iamded, I know it's your birthday, but"
p11331
aS'VROOM! Now for the second part of the build and my favourite, the front of the truck: Annoyingly enough, this part opens up to shoot a pointless rubber projectile: To do this, you open the roof (a nice detail btw) and pull back the mechanism, here: Thus blowing the front part open and launching it'
p11332
aS'well, not far really The wheels and covers are pretty cool, and the front is nicely designed, the red looks good and the rear vision mirrors are a great touch'
p11333
aS' And now for the most disappointing part - step three, the trailer: (Note - Clicky joint piece not part of set, just used to hold it up!) That\'s right, almost the entire thing is open, even the "filled in" side has holes! I\'d certainly be cared to be back there, one bumpy hill and back you go! I didn\'t put the lame computer stickers on, and the control area is pretty lame in general'
p11334
aS" Not to mention Taejo (who is depicted on the boxart as standing at the desk, would most likely just be sucked out the back at those speeds! There are some pluses too though, like the ridiculously awesome minifig paintings I'll be using for Wayne Manor"
p11335
aS' Also note the "control" on Cruncher\'s desk that when turned, turns the gun at the bottom'
p11336
aS" It's an alright feature: Here is an example, I've shot iamded on his birthday"
p11337
aS" What? It's a love ray! Haven't you seen the Care Bears? And though I'm not a massive fan of stickers, this is just too cool"
p11338
aS' The little aquarium is very simple but very clever, using a printed piece between two clear windows to create the illusion of a tank: It looks much better in real life, trust me, and here is a side view to better explain: Now, to connect the two is a good thing, I like the way a simple technic piece assumes the job'
p11339
aS" Oh, and behold my hand! The completed truck, which, while a mixed bag, still doesn't look too bad (I guess): Now the completed set, which, despite its unbelievable large flaws, still looks cool"

aS'cgi?i=3147324 All in all: Minifigs: 5/5 - Racer X is beautiful, Cruncher Block and the Driver too, and Taejo has a ripped shirt, damn! Design: 2/5 - Pretty poor considering the best part is available in a cheaper set, and only the front part of the truck looks cool, but still not truly awful'
p11343
aS" Build: 3/5 - Despite having a bad trailer, it was a fun build and sometimes you need something that doesn't take ages to make"
p11344
aS' Price: 2/5 - Overpriced easily, but Rogue Shadow is worse! Fun: 3/5 - The mere concept of such an open truck kept me playing with this baby for hours! Total: 15/25, not as bad as it would seem'
p11345
aS" Overall I'm really glad I bought it as the minifigs are fantastic and the paintings and fish tank are cool"
p11346
aS" It's fun, stupid and downright ridiculous, but while not a great set by any means, certainly isn't as bad in the brick as it looks in photos"
p11347
aS' Until next time, Batbrick Away! Edited by Batbrick, 13 June 2008 - 12:20 PM'
p11348
aS"Awesome review Batbrick! I don't see any appeal at all really in this set, but that's okay, as I want to stick to Castle anyway"
p11349
aS' The car is the best part IMO, which you can get in a different set with another cool car and for a cheaper price'
p11350
aS" But the main downfall to this set is the fact that the truck's trailer is half blown up and the survivors are magically staying inside and not being sucked right out of there, as you have mentioned"
p11351
aS' I would have thought TLC would at least included some sort of cover that you could take on and off easily (kind of like the modular buildings)'
p11352
aS' Having said all that though, the front of the truck does look incredibly cool, and those minifigs are sweet'
p11353
aS' Too bad they all have flesh tone printed on them'
p11354
aS' So, while this may not be my set of choice, I can see the appeal'
p11355
aS" well, really I can't, but it's just my opinion! I'm sure there are plenty others who would love to scoop this set up"
p11356
aS' ~Peace'
p11357
aS"I'll be passing on this set, thanks for the review anyway, is everyone supposed to be bald in the film? it looks weird"
p11358
aS'WARNING! This reply may contain several minor movie spoilers'
p11359
aS" If you haven't yet seen the movie and want it to be a complete surprise, do not read"
p11360
aS' Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: But it is Cruncher Block, his lady Driver Taejo that really shine'
p11361
aS' Look at those awesome suits! The cool faces! Taejo has a ripped shirt! I was originally skepitcal about the driver figureI like the head, but I was trying to figure out why they put in a female minifig with no hairpiece'
p11362
aS" After having seen the movie, I now understand why; Cruncher's driver is a fairly manly looking woman, and most of the LEGO hairpeices would make the minifig look too girly for the character"
p11363
aS" :) Now that I know why Taejo's shirt is ripped up I don't mind the bits of fleshie color that are printed on it, but I do wish they would make some of the new torsos a little more head-colour agnostic"
p11364
aS"there's no real reason why Cruncher and his driver couldn't have had ties that came all the way up to their necks instead of having those little wedges of flesh showing through loose collars"
p11365
aS" Yeah, they are low-level mafioso type scum, but they aren't complete slobs"
p11366
aS" Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Front view, the new windshields are fantastic: They are indeed very nice, it's the main reason I started looking at the Speed Racer sets in the first place"

aS' Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: While a very cool car, it is rather silly of TLC to give us the exact same one we got in the smaller set'
p11368
aS" I didn't get the smaller set with this car, so I'm still happy, but it is a bad marketing move: I think the error they made was in the smaller set though"
p11369
aS" In the movie, the only time we see Cruncher's semi is when he's being chased by Racer X"
p11370
aS" Racer X and Taejo do end up on the same team for a cross country rally race (along with Speed of course), so I guess that's where they were going by putting those two together in the smaller set, but it would have been much more interesting for them to have made up a set with Taejo and one of the cars from the very goofy, comic book-gimmicky teams they are racing against"
p11371
aS" Especially since one of the teams (that is chasing Taejo specifically) is a bunch of Army-wannabee looniesI'm sure more people would have loved some sort of dark/sand green racer with one of the IJ Soviets at the wheel than another Racer X"
p11372
aS" To summarize: Two Racer X's is bad, but it is the smaller set that should have been changed (imho)"
p11373
aS' Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Annoyingly enough, this part opens up to shoot a pointless rubber projectile: Thus blowing the front part open and launching it'
p11374
aS"well, not far really As much as I normally don't like the stupid techic launcher thing, and would rather not see it in a set ever again (although one of these days I will make a giant multi-launcer rig out of them just for fun), at least there is a reason for it to be in this set, as Cruncher's semi has a missile launcher in the front end of it in the movie"
p11375
aS" I think you're supposed to lift the panel that hides the missile before launching it, similar to the way that panels slide out of the way on the semi cab to allow for firing in the movie"
p11376
aS' Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: And now for the most disappointing part - step three, the trailer: That\'s right, almost the entire thing is open, even the "filled in" side has holes! I\'d certainly be cared to be back there, one bumpy hill and back you go I\'m gonna chock this up to the standard LEGO philosophy of "playset" rather than "model" design for a lot of things'
p11377
aS" The semi rig and Raver X's car are the models, the trailer is the playset"
p11378
aS' Seeing as how the trailer is Cruncher\'s mobile office (rather finely appointed with lots of paintings and his pirahna "babies" in their tank behind his desk), and the intent seems more or less to have a playest bit in order for kids to re-enact the scene from the movie, I\'m not going to give them too much grief over this'
p11379
aS' They tried to capture the basic bits of the movie set (which we see mostly from the inside during the movie) and translate it into a playset type environment'
p11380
aS' That being said, I do wish the back walls were more solid, as I see no reason for there to be gaps in the back wall when the front wall (or the "fourth wall" as the case may be here) is already conspicously absent'

p11383
aS" It's an alright feature: Could have been a little better, but it's such a minor bit of this scene in the movie that I can see why they didn't spend too much time and effort on it"
p11384
aS' It would have been nice to have more paintings though, had the back wall been more complete (and I like your idea of how to use them :) )'
p11385
aS" Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: And though I'm not a massive fan of stickers, this is just too cool"
p11386
aS' The little aquarium is very simple but very clever, using a printed piece between two clear windows to create the illusion of a tank: Definately a feature which is not showcased nearly well enough on the box art'
p11387
aS" Since it is one of the major features of this set in the movie, it's nice to see it translate rather well into brick"
p11388
aS' Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Design: 2/5 - Pretty poor considering the best part is available in a cheaper set, and only the front part of the truck looks cool, but still not truly awful'
p11389
aS" That may be a bit harsh (but not much) given what I've said further up this post, but it probably only deserves a 3 at best, so I'm not realy going to quibble the point"
p11390
aS' :) I still think that Racer X should be exclusive to this set and a different car should be in the smaller set with Taejo, which would have improved the cachet for this set overall'
p11391
aS' Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Price: 2/5 - Overpriced easily, but Rogue Shadow is worse! True'
p11392
aS"this should have ideally been about a $30 set (especially given the general awesomeness of the IJ Race for the Stolen Treasure set), unless they made the trailer a bit more detailed (better back wall, perhaps some drop down gun ports like in the movie) or at put least one (or more) of Cruncher's goons in the set, then maybe I could agree more with the msrp"
p11393
aS' On that note: if I remember correctly from my visit to my local TRU yesterday in search of the new IJ sets (since local Targets seem determined not to get them in stock yet), they had this set on sale for around $35 along with an offer for a coupon good for $7'
p11394
aS'50 towards the purchase of a ticket to the movie with any Speed Racer toy purchase over $25'
p11395
aS' I may be wrong on the sale price, but I know the ticket offer was there'
p11396
aS" So, if you haven't seen the movie yet, and are interested in this set, TRU may be the place to go right now to get both at a slightly cheaper price"

aS' My pocketbook (does not) thank you!'

aS'Thanks for that fine review, Batbrick'

aS' The most interesting part of the set, for me, are the neat MFs'

p11408
aS' its a nice little play set andll fit its purpose I guess'
p11409
aS'Nice review'
p11410
aS' Good pictures, thanks'
p11411
aS' I think I may get a couple of the smaller sets, as I think these will become collectors sets in years too come, Not sure this range will be that popular? Love the minifigs though'
p11412
aS'Batbrick thanks for the sweet review'
p11413
aS' You give me great insights into this set'
p11414
aS' Hehe, I agreed that Racer X is nice, but I believe we can get it in the other set for a much lower price'
p11415
aS' For me, the trailer which does not have a cover is bugging me alot'
p11416
aS" That's why, I holding my reservations against this set"
p11417
aS' At most, I will consider the other 2 smaller sets for collection purpose'

aS' Nevertheless, Batbrick great job'
p11419
aS'Thanks for the review'

aS" My wife wanted me to buy this for the fishtank, and I came close! Untimately this set didn't offer many good part to me so I bought the smaller set with the same car"

p11422
aS'Thank you for the nice review'
p11423
aS'Thanks for the great review! It seems like the most awesome part of the set is the sticker sheet, which is a reversal of the usual situation!'

p11430
aS' Some cool fleshie heads and parts, but it does seem a bit lamer even than I imagined from the box (the "airy" truck is rather slyly disguised on the box art)'

p11460
aS' Plus, this set does seem to have some neat pieces in it (trans green popsicles and lime hubcaps, anyone?)'

I know there's a blunt shooter and flick fire missiles, but is it all framework?"

p11470
aS' I really love this set, sure the figs are annoyingly not new, but the ice cream truck is fantastic and the Tumbler is a marvel of black slopes'
p11471
aS' I see now that it is far too huge though, I reckon I will either keep it that way as a "mega tumbler", mod it to become another Battank, keep it as a model Tumbler, or pull it apart and use the bits to make a Tumbler like Wetwire\'s awesome one'
p11472

aS' - Piece callouts - Models divided into sections - Large images - Page numbers Since there were links posted to the '
p11504
aS'pdf files of the instructions online, Im sure you can all get an idea of the manual and the parts inventory'
p11505
aS' However, for those of you without access to the Internet here are photos of the parts inventory pages: Random manual image: Features page: The Pieces: The short answer is you get lots and lots of little pieces in white, gray and black plus some big pieces in white, gray and black'
p11506
aS' Mixed in the set is a fair amount of oddball pieces like minifig tools, Jedi hood and trans yellow dome'
p11507
aS' Fear not, despite the eclectic collection of parts, it all comes together in the end (not unlike a typical day at work for me) It is probably worth noting again that there is a heavy amount of Technic parts and pieces here'
p11508
aS' The Build: The build starts off with a rather in-depth build of the stand in which General Grievous stands on'
p11509
aS' Once you think you are done, you keep adding on to this (rather solid) base'
p11510
aS' I bet there are 250 pieces just in the base alone! It is quite nice when you get done with it though and really adds to the display'
p11511
aS' Im glad LEGO didnt skimp on the base as it completes the model'
p11512
aS' Once you get through all that, the rest of the build is a real thumb-bruiser'
p11513
aS' Anyone who has built a decent size Technic set knows the feeling of your thumbs being sore when you are done'
p11514
aS' You get the same effect here'
p11515
aS' It is actually a fun build and I really liked seeing how the designers used all the various pieces to recreate a fairly accurate model of Grievous'
p11516
aS' The model is built from the ground up as seen in a few of the progress shots: Here is what is left over: The Design: The design is quite good and is very accurate'
p11517
aS' Some might be disappointed that since this is a Technic set we dont have more articulation in the shoulders and have the ability to separate two arms into four as seen in the movie'
p11518
aS' However, it would seem the real intent is for display and not functionality'
p11519
aS' Here is a shot of the torso and the detail involved: Here are Grievous organs: Careful observers will note that my model is lacking two arrow stickers from the two white chest pieces'
p11520
aS' I failed to see these on the sticker sheet and only grabbed the large Grievous sticker'
p11521
aS' So, note that there are actually THREE stickers and not ONE'
p11522
aS' Chest protector and respirator: Head and arms: I was a little disappointed that we got two yellow blades and no green blades on the lightsabers'
p11523
aS' Note how all the lightsabers have different hilts which is a nice touch: Here are some shots of the completed model with a few other sets shown for scale'
p11524
aS' He is actually pretty tall: You have the option to remove the top two arms and put in shoulder plates if you so desire: Detail on the back: Overall Thoughts: Ive been saying for a few years that we should have a Technic Grievous set and we finally got one'
p11525
aS' Designed more as a model and not a fully functional swooshable figure, Grievous is a tad flimsy'
p11526
aS' You wont want him to veer too far off his massive and sturdy base'
p11527
aS' It would have been nice to have is cape with him (like the Technic Vader set)'
p11528
aS' I do like the size of the model and it is impressive to look at'
p11529
aS' LEGO Star Wars System fans will likely want to think twice before purchasing but Technic and UCS fans should be satisfied'
p11530
aS' Final Rating: 75% Build 8/10 (Very Good  Fun, relatively quick build'
p11531
aS' Technic fans will be more pleased than others'
p11532
aS') Design 8/10 (Very Good  Some nice SNOT and Technic techniques'
p11533
aS' A bit flimsy but the base is kind of cool'
p11534
aS') Parts 7/10 (A mixed bag of stuff'
p11535
aS' Probably cant get too many diverse builds from this except for other robot type models'
p11536
aS') Price 7/10 (Just OK  A bit stiff at $90 USD for a nice display model with limited functionality'
p11537
aS') As always, lets hear your thoughts and feedback'
p11538
aS'Thanks so much dunamis for your awesome review '
p11539
aS' Yeah I think TLC miss the cape, it would be cool to own one but when we were talking of the 2008 sets around july of last year I can remember someone said it would come with cape'
p11540
aS' Finally is a little dissapoint TLC miss it '

aS' This set looks great'
p11544
aS' The designers really though the kit out, it seems'
p11545
aS' The internal organs have got to be my favorite part, but everything is good'
p11546
aS' Now all we need is a UCS Obi-Wan with a laser pistol to finish off Grievous in a totally anti-climatic way!'
p11547
aS'Hey Dunamis, think you can get a straight-on shot of the face? The red pieces inside the eye sockets are topped with trans-greenish-yellow studs which make his face look eerily alive and very close to his screen appearance'
p11548
aS" It's a nice little detail that seems to not show through on pictures I've seen of the set"

p11608
aS' 7646 ETX Alien Infiltrator'
p11609
aS'The walker reminds me of the old Kenner CAP-2 Captivator which is good'
p11610
aS"Thanks very much for the review brickbitz! I love this year's Mars Mission line, and though this is the weakest set, it is still a major improvement"
p11611
aS' The mech is very cool and well made, and the Commander is one of my favourite alien figs ever'
p11612
aS' The alien ship is pretty good, better than last years ones but not extremely good either, but i still like the set'
p11613
aS' Batbrick Away!'
p11614
aS'Thanks for the sweet review, brickbitz! That really is a neat little set, that walker is fantastic, most likely the best part of the set'
p11615
aS" Though the alien craft does also look neat, and it's cool how it can fold down into aa walker"
p11616
aS" Or rather, a sentry turret, seeing as it can't really move while in that mode"
p11617
aS" Still, it's nice"
p11618

p11619
aS' So cute! ~Peace'
p11620
aS'Thanks for that interesting review, brickbitz'
p11621
aS' The alien fighter looks pretty nice, nothing special but streamlined and fast nevertheless'
p11622
aS' That transforming features a nice addition for sure, and these new flicker missile with its launch apparatus'
p11623
aS" hmm, I hope I wont spend quite some time in search of that little 'rocket' piece"
p11624
aS' However, theres still something I miss with these alien crafts'
p11625
aS' I dont know'
p11626
aS' I like some more organic looking design, and they even come in some nice and different shapes, but still'
p11627
aS' perhaps a real space fighter just needs a solid cockpit, cool windscreens and controls to satisfy my odd likings'
p11628
aS" That 'exo suit' looks really good and I wonder why its a little underrepresented on the box art"
p11629
aS' The jet pack/space scooters a really good idea, and the only thing I hatere those darned studless technic beams'
p11630
aS' it could look so much better with a studded version of these parts'
p11631
aS' But of course thats only due to my personal preferences'
p11632
aS'Thanks for the review!! That makes me wanting this set even more!!'

p11650
aS'My first impression upon seeing this set was "no thanks", but now I\'m warming up to it'
p11651
aS" Still, I'll skip it if it interferes with my Hypersonic Operations Aircraft fund"
p11652
aS' :P'
p11653
aS"Hi y'all! Guess what happened today? When walked into my Toys 'R' Us in Fullerton, CA, just to buy a simple Tiny Turbo racer, what do I see? All the Agents sets sitting on the shelf, ready for the taking! I didn't have too much money with me, so I just got 2 of 8631 Mission 1: Jetpack Pursuit! It's a really cool little set, so I thought I'd review this puppy for you! I shall proceed in the order of the instructions"
p11654
aS' So, let\'s get started! The Minifigs Let\'s begin with the minifigs, Saw Fist and Agent Chase! They are really cool, some of the coolest minifigs I have seen in a while! I took off Saw Fist\'s wig & chainsaw so you can see his head and cybernetic arm better! Here is a back view of Saw Fist, and - SURPRISE! Agent Chase has a double sided head! One side with his cool "mission face" with sunglasses and headset, and one with his casual Bruce Wayne type face (note, though, that it is not really the Bruce Wayne face)'
p11655
aS" His wig, btw, is Mutt's hairpiece in black! Very neat! Poor Saw Fist seems to be forced to always drag his chainsaw around for it is way too long to just hang down from his shoulder like a normal arm"
p11656
aS" The Snowmobile Next up, we have the snowmobile, a sleek little vehicle with only minor design flaws! The container with the jewel is attached to the vehicle by a single stud, so it doesn't fall off, but is easy to pick up! In the pic below you can see the only two tiny design flaws: Thanks to the exhaust pipes, the laser cannon (or whatever it's supposed to be) can't be lowered any further than this"
p11657
aS' Also, the corners of that slope-ish piece that the handle bar rests on are sticking out a little at the sides'
p11658
aS" Other than that, it's pretty well done! The Jetpack Finally, there is the Jetpack! IMO, a name like Autogyro-pack or something would make more sense, but whatever"
p11659
aS' Although a little bulky, the Jetpack is very well designed! The rotor can be tilted back, and at the lower back of the Jetpack, there is hook with which you can grab the container with the jewel from the snowmobile'
p11660
aS" What I like best about the Jetpack is that although it is attached to the minifig in kinda the same way as that of the Riddler, this one doesn't rotate around"
p11661
aS' So, the Agent is being held in place steadily! "See ya later, chainsaw-cyborg-dude!" Stickers This set comes with a surprisingly large sticker sheet'
p11662
aS' The reason is that half of it are extra stickers! There are two large Agents logos and one Inferno logo - perfect for Agents MOCs! There are also a star and a small, round sticker portraying the number of the mission'
p11663
aS' The star seems to be part of some kind of game where you collect the stars from all sets on an Agents ID that you get from the Mission 5 set'
p11664
aS" I don't know, though, if you get any gain from this except for becoming a full-status Lego Agent! Below, you can find the list of parts from this set! Click here for a better quality pic! That's pretty much it! I hope you liked this review and will run straight to your next toy store to get one or more of this set! This was my very first set review! So any questions, comments, or requests? Any more pics you want me to take? Would you like me to exchange the chainsaw with something else, or do you want me to try the Agent's new hairpiece out on another fig? If so, just tell me! See ya! Edited by Oky Wan Kenobi, 25 June 2009 - 08:21 PM"
p11665
aS'Thanks for the excellent review Oky! Judging by this set, the line is going to be promising'
p11666
aS" I really like the figs and I'm glad to see that robot arm is actually a new arm mold"
p11667
aS" Awesome!! Can a minifig hand fit in the end or just the chainsaw attachment? Could it fit an Exo-Force robot claw? There's a lot of detail in the torsos and I like that the Agent's suit is like a moto-cross uniform"
p11668
aS' I love that the snowmobile has a working tread'
p11669
aS' Copmike, Ras and I tried to build a snowmobile with working treads, but we ended up using chainsaw blades in the end'
p11670
aS' Great work Oky!'
p11671
aS"That's a great review for your first one"
p11672
aS' I think the jet pack if far to bulky it could do with some minimising but thats life'
p11673
aS' I assume that you cant fit a standard hand in the chainsaw arms are the hole would be to large but would you be so good as to confirm this for me? Overall I quite like the jet ski and the ability to lower the arms to much doesnt both me'
p11674
aS' How much was it just so I can get an idea of the price? Finally thanks for posting this review so quickly'
p11675
aS'This is MUCH MUCH MUCH more promising than the 2008 Batman set for $10'
p11676
aS'00'
p11677
aS' The vehicle looks like someone took time to design it, but the Batman one looks like '
p11678
aS' Lego dear Lego, where is the quality for Batman??!?! I really like the new cyborg arm, and the propellers on that thing : ), it is a really promising line although I would get rid of all those bionicle pieces'
p11679
aS"Thanks for the great review Oky Wan The two vehicles look quite nice for a small set and the minifigs look great! The two sided head is nice, although it would've been nice if it was a new head rather than the standard frowning face"
p11680
aS' The cyborg looks good, nice and cartoony, I like the printing on his back'
p11681
aS' The belt on the hips should be useful, not to mention the robotic hand'
p11682
aS' I assume that anything that fits into a 1x1x1 cylinder can fit in it? I hope so Thanks again Oky'
p11683

p11690
aS'Huhm '
p11691
aS' i like the idea of the agent-ID '
p11692
aS' but offcourse all they want with that is that you buy all six sets '
p11693
aS' but it can be a good idea for children, they wouldn\'t think of "hey they get all money only because i have a little card with stars" or something'
p11694
aS" Well, not to rant, i think it's good"
p11695
aS' Also, can you make that name yourself? maybe set 5 comes with a extra stickersheed with all letters, that would be nice "Agent Rupee" A very nice review Oky Wan Kenobi'
p11696
aS' =Rupee'
p11697
aS'Thanks, guys! I really tried to make it a good first review! Now to answer your questions: The robot arm can fit EF robot claws and anything that a minifig can hold in his hand or that would fit into a 1x1x1 cylinder, so normal minifig hands are too small to fit'
p11698
aS' TLG is using the robot claw idea for the main villain of the Agents line! Do you still want me to try it out and take pics? The price was 10'
p11699
aS'99 USD at the TRU I bought it at'
p11700
aS" I bet it'ss be a dollar less on S@H! And I'm sorry, but I probably won't get any more sets any time soon"
p11701
aS' I have to save my money for all the other good set that are to come'
p11702
aS' But if I would get another set, it would just be the one with the helicopter and the all-silver car! If anyone gets this set, can he/she PLEASE review it? Thanks! Any other questions I can answer for you guys? Edited by Oky Wan Kenobi, 18 May 2008 - 08:59 AM'

aS' The double-sided face is great and I love the sunglass look'
p11706
aS" It's nice that they made use of Mutt's hairpiece which is personally my fave hairpiece at the moment The jet-pack is neat"

p11717
aS' I just wish that instead of a 2x1 plate with an exhaustpipe in each end they would have made it an 1x1 plate with a single exhaust'

p11731
aS' Hmm, although I really like the villain (not just the new arm, I think the color is very'
p11732
aS' villanous, as all Bond-villains with class have minions in uniforms'
p11733
aS" It's even possible to fill out their numbers with Exo-force grunts of the same color) I'm not that hot for the agent himself, his uniform"
p11734
aS' nah'
p11735
aS" It doesn't even look like clothes, just give the man a suit or some nifty leather"
p11736
aS" I think I'll try to grab some sets from the agents line just for the new parts (to begin with"
p11737
aS' MOCs may follow, who knows?) when they are available in stores here in Sweden'

aS' Now I want to see reviews of the other sets :)'
p11740
aS'Thanks for a very good review! Agent line seems better all the time'
p11741
aS' Looking forward in seeing review on Mission 2 Gold Chase (and new pictures of the jet) really soon!'
p11742
aS'Hmm, interesting set'
p11743
aS' Great review! I might pick this one up for the wonderful parts'
p11744
aS' ~VBBN~'
p11745
aS'What a lovely set, thanks for that fine review, Oky Wan Kenobi! The MFsre wonderful, that helipack looks solid and well done and I especially like the slightly asymmetrical design of the neat snowmobile'
p11746
aS' A very playable little set for sure, and the most interesting parts for sure that new cool MF arm'
p11747
aS"They are already on the shelfs? That's kinda weird, since there aren't even the instructions online yet"
p11748
aS'Yay, Oky Wan! Wow, the Agents line is looking good so far'

aS' The jetpack is pretty nice, and the minifigs'
p11750
aS" My dad was in Portland just yesterday, and If I'd have called an hour sooner, he might have been able to get to the TRU"
p11751
aS"Thanks for the great review Oky Wan! At first I didn't think I liked the Agents sets but the more I see them the better I think they look"
p11752
aS' I will definitely pick up 1 or 2 of the sets'
p11753
aS' I really like the jet pack, and the figs look great'
p11754
aS' That double face is very nice'
p11755
aS' TLG should make more figs with these faces in my opinion'
p11756
aS'Great review!Thank youvery much! I think this line is much more promising than most orginally thought it would be'
p11757
aS" I'm onmy way to see ifican find the big rig right now!"
p11758
aS'Thank you for the nice review'
p11759
aS" It has some big pieces I don't like, but the minifigs are good"
p11760
aS'WOW lovin this set I think I will get all the agents sets if they are as good as this'
p11761
aS' The snowmobile canon isnt to mush of a problemo because the agent guy is flying and the canons pointing up'
p11762
aS' Thanks for the review!!!'
p11763
aS"I got and put together this set yesterday, and since then I've so fallen in love with it that I've just got to review it"
p11764
aS' The main components of the set are the jet, the truck and trailer, and the three Minifigs; Gold Tooth, an Inferno Henchman, and Agent Fuse'
p11765
aS' Fuse is your basic jet pilot-looking guy, but he does come with one of those handy double-printed faces with smiley look an a scared look'
p11766
aS' The Henchman is your basic LEGO criminal with an Inferno uniform, and Gold Tooth is the perfect example of a super-villain with his gold hair, gold teeth, gold piercings, and golden gun (Auric Goldfinger meets Saramanga?) The Inferno Jeep is a nice, quick build with cool rubberized shocks and a slick, almost futuristic design'
p11767
aS' The black and orange colors work really well together and the swiveling back seat for the Henchman and his huge pistols is a nice touch'
p11768
aS" The fact that the trailer hauling the gold bricks and target gimmick is a separate piece instead of a bed assembly on the jeep is great because it allows the Jeep to stand on it's own without the cargo or gimmick"
p11769
aS' The best part of the set, however, is the Agents jet'
p11770
aS" It's small and uncomplicated, but it's very cool and very satisfying"
p11771
aS' The large cockpit on the smaller body is sort of reminiscent of old GI Joe jet toys'
p11772
aS' The air intakes on the bottom are made with the ever-popular SNOT building technique which is sure to please many'
p11773
aS" But just the sheer swooshability of the jet and it's compact sweetness is reason enough to get this set"
p11774
aS" Heck, I'm already considering getting a few more and swapping the dark blue on the jet out for other colors so I can have a small, multi-colored fleet of the things"
p11775
aS' The abundant stickers might turn some people off, but the level of detail they add to the jet is worth the hassle'
p11776
aS' Man, I really wish LEGO would do more modern-style military-type vehicles like this, because it is full of win'
p11777
aS" I'd wholeheartedly recommend this set to all LEGO vehicle fans, and I also believe that really any LEGO fan would like this set"
p11778
aS' I can only give it a score of out of 5'
p11779
aS"How much was it, and does the suspension work well? If it doesn't, I've lowering the truck, it looks pretty pathetic"
p11780
aS"Squeaker, on May 19 2008, 08:34 PM, said: How much was it, and does the suspension work well? If it doesn't, I've lowering the truck, it looks pretty pathetic"
p11781
aS" I'd call the suspension average"
p11782
aS' It uses those little rubber double-axle-hole pieces'
p11783
aS' Not as good as a mechanical assembly or something with springs, but it does okay'
p11784
aS" I don't think it'd harm the look of the Jeep to lower it at all"
p11785
aS' And I picked it up for $31 US'
p11786
aS"but this was at Toys R Us, so I think it'll be $30 pretty much everywhere else"

p11801
aS'Thanks for the review'
p11802
aS' I really like this'
p11803
aS' I mean, yeah, so I like all the Agents sets, but still the point stands'
p11804
aS" The plane is great, and would probably stand well on it's own"
p11805
aS' That then makes the jeep a welcome addition'
p11806
aS' Fuse is really cool, especially the scared head which looks brilliant'
p11807
aS' Gold Tooth (nice and subtle) is pretty cool as well, in a campy sort of way'
p11808
aS" In fact, that's something I like in the whole line"
p11809
aS" It's a bit camp (in a spy-fest sort of way)"
p11810
aS" I'm not sure whose idea it was to put the gold haul on a rickety trailer, where it's likely to fall off"
p11811
aS' Because I hope Dr Inferno has harsh words with them!'
p11812
aS"Nice review thanks, although I must say the set itself doesn't really inspire me"
p11813
aS" The Jet is obviously the best thing about it, but I'm starting to get fed up with technic cannons now"
p11814
aS" I've got so many floating around from the last year or so's sets"
p11815
aS" I'm sure I'll end up getting all the Agents sets for parts at the very least when they appear here in the UK"
p11816
aS"Thanks for the review Deino, I love all the Agents sets and this one is a must! I love Gold Toth, the perfect campy Roger Moore bond villain, as you said, a cross between The Man with the Golden Gun and the Man with the golden touch himself! I love that jet too, simply fantastic, I can't believe we actually thought this line would be bad"
p11817
aS' The SNOT air intakes are fabulous, and I love the colours (orange and dark blue), I can\'t wait to make some "Agents" scenes with all these cool spy fest figs'

p11822
aS'A sleek and swooshable jet indeed in an of course great color scheme with a cool butterfly tail and a nifty grey barrel exhaust nozzle'

p11826

aS'Great review, Deinonychus'
p11838
aS' Agents is looking cooler and cooler with every new review'
p11839
aS" This kit is the best we've seen so far - the jeep is cool and reminds me of Halo"
p11840
aS' And of course, the Jet is amazing'
p11841
aS' And the figures'
p11842
aS" oh man, are they awesome! Kudos to TLC for making a new spy theme that doesn't reek of the failures of Alpha Team"
p11843
aS"Thanks for the sweet review, Deino! This looks like a neat set, though I must say one of the first things that struck me was the henchman stole Gold Tooth's gold tooth"
p11844
aS' Well, one of them anyway'
p11845
aS" Anyway, that gold hair piece is sweet, as is the fire hose end gun, I wasn't expecting that! The Agent's reversible head is another great bonus, The jeep is fantastic, I love orange! The Jet's nice too, but I really love the Jeep! Is there anything under the hood of the jeep? It looks openable, but it may be like that just for the sloped look"
p11846
aS' ~Peace'
p11847
aS'Quote Is there anything under the hood of the jeep? It looks openable, but it may be like that just for the sloped look'
p11848
aS' Oh yeah, totally forgot about that after I built it Under the hood is a pair of red cones attached to one of those little handle pieces on a hinge'
p11849
aS' It doesn\'t rise out of the "engine" compartment very far, but I suppose they are supposed to be hidden blasters'
p11850
aS'Thanks for the great review and pics! I picked this set (and Mission 1) up yesterday, and like you, was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked them'
p11851
aS" As I'm all about minifig weaponry, here are two close-ups of what TLC has these guys packing: All in all, not bad for TLC, but frankly, I've been a bit spoiled when it comes to more accurate minifig firearms"

aS" You've sold the set to me; I wasn't planning on buying this!"
p11856
aS'Oh great they changed the weapons! They were supposed to be Batman guns! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Anyway i will get this for the jet'
p11857
aS'Thank you so very much for the great pictures, Deinonychus! All in all, mixed emotions for me '
p11858
aS" First of all the guns, what's up with that? In premilimanary photos there where either Batman guns or SW Blasters, but then they end up arming these guys with the worst choice available (ok, no guns would be worse, but next to worse)"
p11859
aS' A hose nozzle is hardly a gun, not even plated with gold'
p11860
aS" Well, I guess it's all about mocing now"
p11861
aS' The jet is just ok for me'
p11862
aS' My guess was right, the afterburner is a barrel, and, for me, it looks just like a barrel stuck to the tale'
p11863
aS' That canopy is even worse then it seemed from other angles, too'
p11864
aS' But with some heavy modifications, it still has potential'
p11865
aS' O the more positive note, I love the colour scheme, and the jeep is much better looking and design then I expected'
p11866
aS'Deinonychus, thanks for taking time to provide us such wonderful pictures'
p11867
aS' You have review the most important set that I am thinking to get for the Agent theme'
p11868
aS' I was hoping someone can provide me some good pictures of the fighter jet which is the only thing that attract me the most'
p11869
aS' Although, there are some stickers laying around, but the slick design makes up for it'
p11870
aS' I must admit that the level of building and design, cannot be compared with MOCs such as Ralph_S'

p11890
aS') the Box & Instructions: Front: Back: Instructions: The Minifig (i love that torso): General Overview of the Set (notice the NEW tyres!): The Car alone: The trailer with the neat little Boat: The equiqment holder: The boat alone, and i must say this is designed great, looks really like a little scooter: The trailer, nothing too special here: Summary: I just got that set, but i love it! I really like these new cars, cause they are much more real looking, except maybe of the missing doors, but that can be fixed with a little bit mocing in this case'
p11891
aS' If you see it, buy it'

p11897
aS'and the boat alone: Now that is something i think could have been made better, or say, put at least SOMETHING in it, the storage room in the stern of the boat'
p11898
aS" Though it's got plenty of room and you can put in anything you like: The next detail i love are the motors of the boat, the're really well-designed and you can even move them sideways or pull 'em up if they're not needed: The wench on the trailer to pull the boat on it or load it off to the water: And last but not least, the cockpit of the truck, nothing too special but i really like that the did put the black slope brick screen in it: That was it folks, quite a few pictures, huh? Summary: Just one word: BUY"
p11899
aS" As i said this is my favourite of the new sets, and if i was i child i think i could play hours and hours with it, as it's got great plaability and isn't really fragile or something"

p11906
aS'? Well, you know what I mean'

p11908
aS' And although that big trucks indeed, ahem, big, I dont mind at all'
p11909
aS' I just love that unimoginess of it'

p11956
aS" These are indeed two sweet sets, my favourite part is actually the little boat in the smaller set, it's built really well and looks fantastic"
p11957
aS" I'd pick up these sets if my money weren't devoted to the Castle theme"
p11958
aS' Thanks again for the sweet review! ~Peace'
p11959
aS'I find it a little odd that these two sets are basically the same idea, a car with boat on trailer'
p11960
aS' Just different sized'
p11961
aS" I feel like I'd only need to get the smaller one really, since it covers the concept"
p11962
aS'Thanks for the reviews!! I like both kits'
p11963
aS' If I was to buy one, it would be the truck and large boat'
p11964
aS" I don't really want another 4WD / trailer combo in my city"
p11965
aS' I do however like the running boards on the 4WD, something I might incorporate into my fire 4WD'
p11966
aS'Thanks Metallandi, great reviews'
p11967
aS' For me the Truck and Boat (7726) are the best, the return of the mighty car door!! I really like this theme, the colours work really well for me'
p11968
aS' some great pieces in there to'
p11969
aS' JB'
p11970
aS'Beautiful sets, i like'
p11971
aS'I love the boats in both sets'
p11972
aS' How do these designers POSSIBLY put the perfect combination of bricks together to make a set? Well'
p11973
aS' I have only done anything like it once'
p11974
aS' Look below in my signature'
p11975
aS' Those are my prized works of art'
p11976
aS' But still'
p11977
aS' nothing compared to what these people make'
p11978
aS' But if you think about it, they have access to any pieces they want'
p11979
aS"Howdy! Not sure how many reviews of this are floating around here, but by request of Sir Dano and Nannan, here's my little, pictorial review"
p11980
aS" I'll post pics here, then give you the flickr links for more info/notes on the set"
p11981

p11985
aS' Plus, the minifigures are really nice'
p11986
aS" Some cool new elements, too, like Break Jaw's"
p11987
aS'jaw and new barbed wire (which is "rubbery") Thanks again!'
p11988
aS'Thank you'
p11989
aS'Thanks for the review! Do i see a little Indy hint on that map? Oh and btw'
p11990
aS', the map looks like it actually is printed am i right?'
p11991
aS"Looks good, and I'll bet that jaw and wire could be used for lots of MOCs"
p11992
aS" Is this the only Agents set that contains the wire? While I'm here: I got the third mission, would anyone like a review of that? Faramir"
p11993
aS"That would be great! I still wonder why the instructions aren't up yet, though"
p11994
aS'Mmm this set looks amazing'
p11995
aS' lovely pieces'
p11996
aS' And I actually like the minifig faces'
p11997
aS' That Jaw helmet is cool aswel '
p11998
aS' Are those stickers on the crocodile heads or is it printed?'
p11999
aS'Not many words this time, but as they say: a picture is worth a thousand words - and your pictures are lovely! Once again, Agents is turning out to be a cooler and cooler theme with each new review'
p12000
aS' This set looks like an awesome parts pack, and I love the bike! BTW, anyone else notice the possibly accidental reference to Alpha Team? Agent Charge is back, it looks! Edited by Grevious, 21 May 2008 - 09:05 PM'
p12001
aS'Thanks for the review, this set is wonderful! U love the TWO dark green crocodiles and awesome minifigs, especially break jaw That bike is awesome and the base, like all agents sets, comes with great pieces, like the barbed wire, orange anything, leafy pieces and brown log pieces'
p12002
aS" Thanks for the review, I'll definitely get this one! Batbrick Away!"
p12003
aS'Wow, great review for a really great looking set'
p12004
aS' The pieces, like the minifigs and crocs are very nice, but that map is reeaally cool for an Aztec/Maya/Inca fan (like me)! I will definately buy this set when it is available in England'
p12005
aS' Grevious, on May 21 2008, 10:04 PM, said: BTW, anyone else notice the possibly accidental reference to Alpha Team? Agent Charge is back, it looks! Yeah, I thought that'
p12006
aS' Then I thought, "nah, he looks different", but I remember that the characters in Alpha Team did change their looks a lot throughout the years (being spies and that)'

aS'A really cool playset, thanks for these great pics, SirNadroj! A silver jaw helm, cycrocs, some cool faces and a very swooshable bike'
p12009
aS' see you later, alligator! The only thing I dont get entirelyre these neat barbwire circles'
p12010
aS' Whats the purpose with these'
p12011
aS' life rings for masochists? Well'
p12012
aS' that makes me look at that tower in a completely new way too'
p12013
aS' baddies baywatch on! But wherere the girls?'
p12014
aS'Have you made any other reviews? I want more'
p12015
aS" Please? I'm not planning to get this set, but its pretty cute"
p12016
aS' The set itself is okay, but the figs are amazing'
p12017
aS' Agent Charge: I want that head'
p12018
aS' Unibrow man! Great villain! Crocs'
p12019
aS'Great little set, nice to have a small building instead of all vehicles'
p12020
aS' Plant pieces and dark green crocs always welcome'
p12021
aS' Good parts selection for the price'
p12022
aS" Thanks for the review! Can't wait till we can get our hands on these!"
p12023

p12030
aS' Im definately gonna pick it up when I see it'
p12031
aS' I like the design of the base and it comes with lots of usefull an neat pieces'
p12032
aS'Great looking set! Im determined to get all the Agent sets this summer'
p12033
aS' Comments: Swamp Tower-The barbed wire is cool, but it seems like its only for looks'
p12034
aS' Bike-Cool looking, but doesnt seem to have any controls'
p12035
aS' Cybercrocs-Wow, havent seen any of these pieces for a while, and in dark green, awesome! Agent Charge-Sweet head, definitely cool'
p12036
aS' Break Jaw-He looks like the result of some animal testing on humans gone horribly wrong'
p12037
aS' I hope they come out near me soon'
p12038
aS'Wow, thanks for the great review, SirNadroj! The overall set is what attracted me in the first place, that elevated hut and swampy setting just sucked me right in! It all looks really nice to me, a definite buy'
p12039
aS' That Agents head would make a great Indy, for those opposed to fleshies'
p12040
aS' And that monobrow, I mean, villain guy looks very'
p12041
aS' er'
p12042
aS' well, the monobrow is unique, thought I noticed the suit looks a bit skin tight in the crotchal area'
p12043
aS" Don't look at me like that, you saw it too! Anyway, the helmet's the best part about the villain, great for Warhammer 40,000 Orks"
p12044
aS' ~Peace'
p12045
aS"Very useful pieces, that new Agent head (I think it's new) could be used for a Gordon Freeman minifigure, and Break Jaw's head for Otis the security guard when you take his donuts away from him"
p12046
aS'I always joked that our house would have a moat around it with mechanical alligators'
p12047
aS' Now I can build the house in lego! Thanks SirNadroj for the review and pictures'
p12048
aS' This is definitely my favorite Agents set'
p12049
aS'Great review and a good confirmation of exactly what I suspected'
p12050
aS' this is a parts line for me'
p12051
aS" Much like Exoforce before it, this will be the theme I pick up when I'm out of other things, or it's on sale"
p12052
aS' Plus those dark green alligators bring tears of joy to an old pirate'

p12060
aS"Why do all of the reviews that we have for Agents sets have the agents getting hurt? Is this a new trend? Plus Unibrow man doesn't have a unibrow"

p12063
aS" And it's because villains are cooler"
p12064
aS' Actually, it could be long-simmering resentment towards the not-highly-regarded Alpha Team/ Dino Attack sets bubbling forth'
p12065
aS" See Dr Lucky's hilarious post here for an example of what I mean"
p12066
aS" I'm sure the new agents will learn to fight back soon"
p12067
aS'does anyone know if the turbo car chase is out yet?'
p12068
aS"I've copied another thing because i don't know how i must do a review"
p12069
aS" And i can't do long reviews! Set ref: 7884 Name: The Buggy: The Escape of Mr Freeze Number of minifigs: 2 Number of pieces: 76 Price: 13,95 Front of the box: Back of the box: The comic: Very close: What's in the box: Without: The set: The set with the box: The time: Wow, this is a funny set, but it's a little expensive, and a little to small, but i like some pieces like the fire, and the mr freeze gun"
p12070
aS" And the best of all, here it comes, NO STICKERS! That's one of the greatest things"
p12071
aS' But i understand why lego has made this set, some people want batman lego, and they are most of the time expensive, and the mr freeze set is also expensive, but this set not'
p12072
aS' If you want more pics, you msut ask! For exaple for the minifigs, or the mr freeze and the blaster'

p12079
aS' Freeze and a very cool new Batman'
p12080
aS' But I have to say that these two small vehicles just look plain ugly IMHO, without any inspiration nor orginality'
p12081
aS' Sorry, TLC, but you can for sure do better than that, and even with less pieces'
p12082
aS"Nice review, thanks! I really like those little go-kart thingies, they've got a fantastic Mario Kart look to them"
p12083
aS'Thanks for the review'
p12084
aS' Ill probably get one copy of this set'
p12085
aS' Mr'
p12086

p12099
aS'Freeze fig is fantastic, and I would buy two of this set just for him, as his head and gear are very useful for mocing'
p12100
aS' It also comes with some nice pieces, like the grappling hook, little wheels, exhaust pieces and such'
p12101
aS' Still, a pretty bad set build wise, but it has atleast inspired me to make my own Batbuggy Thanks for the review theriddler, appreciated'
p12102
aS' Batbrick Away!'
p12103
aS"As others have said, this really is a set for those that didn't buy the Batcave"
p12104
aS' Thus I want it! The cars are pretty horrid though'
p12105
aS' Thanks for the review ???theriddler???!'
p12106
aS'Thanks for the review! For such a high price that we need to fork out, compared to a total pieces of 76'
p12107
aS" It's is very expensive to pay for such poor design"
p12108
aS' But then, I will still considered to get them'
p12109
aS' As what Sinner had said, this is a very good way to get Mr Freeze without getting the Batcave'
p12110
aS' And it so happened that, I do not have the Batcave too'
p12111
aS' I believed that is the cheapest set among the four'
p12112
aS' So, for the mini-figs ONLY, this set is recommended'
p12113
aS' Other than that, I am sorry'
p12114
aS"Like many others, I'll buy this just for Mr F, quickly recycle the parts, and pretend this set never existed"
p12115
aS' The flame detail is indeed terrible'
p12116
aS" The Bat is back - and he's flatulent! This third Bat-wave isn't really doing anything for me"
p12117
aS" I'll get the Penguin set as well for pretty much the same reason - although the sub on that is pretty cool - but skip the others"
p12118
aS' Maybe Batbrick can make us all nice alt-mocs to improve these sets'
p12119
aS' Thanks for the review though!'
p12120
aS'Thanks for the review ???theriddler???'
p12121
aS" This is a neat little set, a bit overpriced in my opinion, but for a new suited Batman and a Mr Freeze fig in a set other than one of the most expensive Bat-sets released, it's worth my money"
p12122
aS' ~Peace'
p12123
aS"WOWIE!!!!!! I'm glad you like it! Maby i'l do the tumbler also! But soon the batcycle and the scuba also come!"
p12124
aS'Pretty nice review for a first time ???theriddler???'
p12125
aS' Next time though, if your camera has it, use the macro function (little flower icon) and perhaps a tripod'
p12126
aS' That should get rid of any blur and provide you with better pictures'
p12127
aS' Apart from that, a good little review'
p12128
aS' Keep up the good work!'
p12129
aS'Neat little set'
p12130
aS" I do like the parts a number of hard to find bits all in one pack, depending on how much it costs in USD I'll have to consider it"
p12131
aS" And while the buggy designs kinda suck, I'm a little happy to see them, its been years since TLC made any small go kart style vehicles"
p12132
aS' I guess Tiny Turbos have been overshadowing that market?'
p12133
aS'Thanks for the reveiw The figs are bloody great! but those cars are a bit'
p12134
aS" well I'll put it blantly, RETARDED!!! Although they shall be good after some modding! and whats with that grapple hook? does it even have a rope, so I guess Batman will hokk it to Mr freeze so his ride looks more ugle anyway, can you pleese take some pics of the figs"
p12135
aS"That's a great set"
p12136
aS" It'd be even better if it were sold as two separate little cars"
p12137
aS' They remind me of the dozens of little LEGO cart vehicles I got as a kid'
p12138
aS' Those were always fun, quick builds that resulted in lots of cool play'
p12139
aS" I think this set is aimed more at kids and, in that respect, it's a pure winner"
p12140
aS" It doesn't hurt that you can get Freeze and the newly designed Batman both in this set for a reasonable price"

p12153
aS'In actuality, I think that this may be my favorite Batman set of all time'
p12154
aS" I know, I know - it's a small set with crappy tiny vehicles; so it probably sucks for the fan who likes to display sets; but look at the MOCing side and you see this set has a ton of potential: -New Batman fig"
p12155
aS" Well, mainly the torso; but it looks nice, sleek, and armored! A definite plus whether you're a MOCist or batfan"

p12158
aS' Because nobody bought the Batcave when they should have'
p12159
aS'and by nobody I mean me'
p12160
aS' Plus, I love that head! -Cheapest way to amass the lightning piece'
p12161
aS" The other sets that have it are lolhueg (Well, not really, but I don't have $50 to toss around on a little skeleton tower"
p12162
aS"), and it's a great piece"
p12163
aS' -Two little blue gems'
p12164
aS" I may be alone on this, but those are my favorite parts (the gems), and that's my favorite color for them! <3 <3 <3 -Several other useful parts, including a +O piece in black, some light/medium blue bits from Mr"
p12165
aS" Freeze's kart, the oddly placed grappling hook, and some cheap wheels"
p12166
aS" Now, I don't know about you guys, but this is as close to a Batman Battlepack as we're going to get, lol - I'm buying at least three, maybe more once I get my summer job ^"
p12167
aS"^ (Oh, and the fact that the US price is only $10 helps a little, but this year you guys can't complain - you got practically every set first, ESPECIALLY the new castle! T"
p12168
aS'T) ~Trexxen'
p12169
aS'Thanks for the review'
p12170
aS' I dont know if I would get this set though'
p12171
aS' The cars are not that great and the price is a little too high'
p12172
aS'I got this yesterday and built it this morning'
p12173
aS' Apart from the figs, it is very crappy'
p12174
aS" Mr Freeze's buggy is OK but the bat buggy is easily the worst vehicle I've seen for years"
p12175
aS' Colours are all over the place, the grappling hook feels cheaply made, the inclusion of those odd pearl silver parts which have been in the Exo-Force sets seem especially random here, the terrible Bionicle flame piece'
p12176
aS" It's the first Lego vehicle I've built where I've immediately had the urge to disassemble it and pretend I never bought it! Really, I only got it for Mr Freeze so I shouldn't complain"
p12177
aS' But still'
p12178
aS" It's a real step backwards"
p12179
aS' The comparable Catwoman dragster set was heaps better'
p12180
aS' The Penguin sub is sweet though Thanks for the review anyway!'
p12181
aS'Coming in at around $50 US, Turbo Car Chase is one of the bigger of the new Agents sets'
p12182
aS' A big box with a helicopter, car, and gate in it'
p12183
aS" Seems like a winner, but how good is it really, and is it worth the cash? Let's start with the Minifigs"
p12184
aS' This set comes with a standard Inferno Henchman, Spy Clops, and Agent Chase'
p12185
aS' The Henchman is you basic LEGO criminal type with a gun and a jumpsuit, nothing real groundbreaking here'
p12186
aS' Spy Clops, on the other hand, is very cool for, technically, half of a Minifig'
p12187
aS' His head has a neat electronic goggle print and the rest of him is a torso mounted onto a set of six legs made from Exo-Force robot arms'
p12188
aS' The whole thing is really well done and neat as hell'
p12189
aS' Agent Chase (Turbo Car Chase! ) seems to have a standard agent body and a double-printed face with one side a sunglasses and headset print'
p12190
aS' The other face is a determined Agent look'
p12191
aS' The set also includes a laptop with Doctor Inferno wallpaper'
p12192
aS' The laptop is a new piece and works like the LEGO books that are in a lot of Harry Potter sets'
p12193
aS' Molding on the keyboard is really well done and the thing can be held by a Minifig along either corner, but not in the middle and not while closed'
p12194
aS' The gate in the set is nothing revolutionary by itself, and I sort of get the feeling that it was included to drive up the piece count and the set price point'
p12195
aS' That being said, there are some things to like here'
p12196
aS' For instance, the gate has four wheels of barbed wire attached to it'
p12197
aS' The barbed wire is new and makes me want to start building some World War I trench MOCs'
p12198
aS' The rest of the gate is fairly big and it has a handy ramp attached so that vehicles can roll through it easily'
p12199
aS' The main feature of the gate is a sound brick'
p12200
aS" It's much better then LEGO sound and light units of the past, when the gate is opened it depresses a button and an alert klaxon blares that sounds every bit like a prison-beak in progress"
p12201
aS" The triggering action works surprisingly well and it's pretty much for this feature alone that I'm not going to immediately break the gate back down and add it to my parts bin"
p12202
aS' The designers did make an effort to create more then just a fence though'
p12203
aS' A nice control panel connected to a big spotlight crowns the piece, and a pair of cameras watch the opening'
p12204
aS" It's really hard to mess up a LEGO helicopter, and this set is no exception"
p12205
aS' The Inferno Chopper is a nicely proportioned and well built machine'
p12206
aS' It looks properly menacing and has the uniform orange and black of other Inferno property'
p12207
aS" It's armed with a set of four Technic pegs cleverly used as guns on outriding mounts, as well as a pair of the newer-style flick-fire missiles"
p12208
aS" I personally don't care for flick-firing missiles, but these look decent enough and seem to stay put so I really can't complain about them"
p12209
aS" Along the fuselage are a pair of intake pieces that I've never seen before and I'm guessing are new"
p12210
aS" They're pretty well designed and will come in handy for MOCing down the road"
p12211
aS' The action feature of the aircraft is the wench system'
p12212
aS' This is very different then other LEGO wenches in that you build the entire mechanism and housing'
p12213
aS' You can then use it to raise Spy Clops up and down from the bottom of the chopper using the rotor'
p12214
aS' Now, this also keeps you from sitting there and just giving the rotor repeated spins to simulate flight'
p12215
aS" I'm not too thrilled with that, but there are a hundred other LEGO helicopters out there with fully rotating rotors, so I guess I can let it by just this once"
p12216
aS" As you'd suspect, the bottom of the cockpit is completely open, which makes this a vehicle pretty much solely for Spy Clops (Sorry Henchman)"
p12217
aS' But there is plenty of room beneath the body to attach a plate with some seats on it to accommodate another pilot without drastically altering the design, or even removing existing pieces'
p12218
aS' The Turbo Car is a slick little honey of a LEGO car, and the silver pieces that make up the body work contribute a lot to that fact'
p12219
aS' The front license plate appears to be an Exo-Fore code brick'
p12220
aS' But it also hides the activation lever for the passenger ejector seat'
p12221
aS" The seat works about as well as the Spruce Goose, which is to say not well at all, but here it's the thought that counts"
p12222
aS' The interior of the car is really well done'
p12223
aS" There's even a radar screen for keeping track of pesky helicopters"
p12224
aS" But the Bond-like features don't end there"
p12225
aS' A lever in the compartment raises pair of guns in the hood and a knob on the rear deploys a quad rocket system with more flick-fire missiles'
p12226
aS" This is a car that won't be stopped easily! The rear has two cones sticking out"
p12227
aS" I'd like to think they're smoke nozzles or oil-slick sprayers"
p12228
aS' All-in-all, this is a really good set'
p12229
aS' The car is pure LEGO vehicle love and looks fantastic'
p12230
aS" The silver pieces are very nice and it's a shame LEGO doesn't use metallic colors in System sets more often"
p12231
aS' There are, however, a LOT of sticker for this set and I know how much that bugs a lot of people'
p12232
aS" I personally like how much detail the stickers add to these sets and don't mind them so much"
p12233
aS' The set also comes with an Agents ID card for Chase which you can put little star stickers on from other sets as you get them'
p12234
aS" It's printed on a real nice piece of sturdy plastiboard and would be cooler if you could put your own picture and name on it instead of pretending to be Chase"
p12235
aS' Sold by themselves, the car and chopper would be must-haves'
p12236
aS" All tossed together with the gate sort of makes the set a little less then the sum of it's parts"
p12237
aS" And with 498 parts (most of them small) that's not so hot"
p12238
aS" It's only slightly over-priced in my opinion, but if you do shell out the money you won't regret it"
p12239
aS" I'm very comfortable recommending this set to anyone"
p12240
aS' Close to perfect, but the price and some minor flaws bring it back just a little'
p12241
aS" I'd say 4"
p12242
aS'33, but out of 5 is close enough!'
p12243
aS'Looks cool, one of the best in this line'
p12244

p12249
aS' I look forward to reading your thoughts on it'
p12250
aS' I will say 2 things about it now though'
p12251
aS' 1)My set came with defective instructions'
p12252
aS' In 2 places pages are missing and duplicates of other pages repeated'
p12253
aS' For instance, the car instructions are missing steps 16-21'
p12254
aS' Fortunately, I was able to make out what pieces went where in the missing steps by studying the illustration in step 22'
p12255
aS' I hope you have better luck with your instructions'
p12256
aS" 2)This set contains the best LEGO sound brick ever (it's just begging to be incorporated into my Arkham Asylum)"
p12257
aS"Yay! Can't wait for your review"
p12258
aS' I plan to get this and the giant truck'

p12263
aS' Maybe its like the Exo-Force light-up brick, only with sound instead of light'

p12273
aS' I agree 100%'
p12274

p12275
aS' Usually LEGO promotes stuff like that pretty loudly on the packaging'
p12276
aS' Not here though'
p12277
aS"WOW! Thanks, Deino, for this great review! I can't wait to get this myself, but right now I gotta save for the CW sets! The car is with no doubt one of the most mind blowing things TLG has come up with and we can only hope that there will be more models made out of almost only metalic colors! The spider cyborg, while not as innovative as some of the other cyborgs, is a very nice fig, and his head will be very usefull for Splinter Cell MOCs! And those intake pieces are only relatively new btw, they are in almost all of the current $10 Racers sets"
p12278
aS' Any chance of you taking a pic of a line-up of all the silver parts in this set? Edited by Oky Wan Kenobi, 24 May 2008 - 11:32 PM'
p12279
aS'Great review, Deino! Man, that car is just so beautiful, and the helicopter is nice too'
p12280
aS" Unfortunately, this seems pretty pricy, and I hardly think I'll be getting it any time soon, what with my limited budget and all"
p12281
aS" Still, it's great to see how well Agents is shaping up"
p12282
aS'I love it ! Fun, playable, cool looking, and killer minifigs! Sweet!'
p12283
aS'Thanks for the review Deino! I love going back through the old "Agents" thread just to see how wrong we were about these awesome sets! I actually really like the gate, those portcullis pieces people may know i always find nice uses for, and I really, really, really want that awesome sound brick'
p12284
aS' The figs are a bit disappointing in numbers, but agent Chase is very cool, generic henchman are great, and Spy Clops is one of my favourite minifigs ever! The helicopter is wonderful too, I love that it is customised for Spy clops to winch him down'
p12285
aS' The colours as usual for these sets are fantastic, the dark blue, orange and chrome silver! The car is the best though, I love all the functions'
p12286
aS' How does the ejector seat work though? Batbrick away!'
p12287
aS'Wow, thanks for the great review Deino This set is really a must have for me'
p12288
aS" The sound brick seems great, the helicopter looks very nice and the car is superb! All of the James Bond features are really cool, though I'm very interested in how the ejector seat works (or doesn't work"
p12289
aS" The car itself is very sleek and full of beautiful silver, and the inclusion of the new rims and windshield mean that I won't have to buy many Speed Racer sets"
p12290
aS' As for the minifigs, they all look great, especially SpyClops'
p12291
aS' Though it looks rather easy for him to fall off of his spider legs'
p12292
aS' Can you confirm this? A great review of a great set, thanks Deinonychus'
p12293
aS'Thanks for the awesome review, Deinonychus! This really is a sweet set, a bit expensive a set for me, as I only get the cheaper non-Castle sets, which is a shame because I love that head! It would be great for some more cyborg troops'
p12294
aS" The car is awesome, I didn't expect it to have that many silver parts, that's fantastic! Heaps of play features too, that ejector seat mechanism sounds interesting"
p12295
aS' Thanks again for the sweet review! ~Peace'
p12296
aS'Deinonychus, on May 23 2008, 09:12 PM, said: The rear has two cones sticking out'
p12297
aS" I'd like to think they're smoke nozzles or oil-slick sprayers"
p12298
aS' According to page 14 of my BrickMaster magazine, the left cone is for smoke screen and the right cone is for oil slick'
p12299
aS"Wow great review thanks! This set looks absolutely great!!!! But I'm afraid of the price Oh weel I'll just get the 2 smaller ones"

aS'94K 110 downloads The ejector seat A long Technic axle runs the length of the front of the car'
p12304
aS' It comes in to the seat area here and nests into the gray joint which is attached to the small gray Technic beam'
p12305
aS' The beam is attached to the ejector seat (bottom white 3x2 plate) with a Technic pin'
p12306
aS' The seat, in turn, is attached to the side of the car with a Technic pin'
p12307
aS' The result is, when the axle is pushed forward, the gray joint and beam tilt the seat and "eject" a Minifig'
p12308
aS' After about 20 shots the Minifig only went outside of the car 3 times'
p12309
aS'the rest of the time he just bounced around the inside of the car'
p12310
aS' So they get an A for effort, but an F for execution'
p12311
aS'Thanks Deinonychus for another great review'
p12312
aS' I must say I do look forward to people uploading reviews of new sets, it really helps me decide if I want it or not'
p12313
aS" If it's a good set (IMO) then it adds to the excitement of picking up one myself! This, I must say, is one of those sets! The only concern for me, like alot of others, is the price"
p12314
aS" I will just have to wait and see and continue to look at these photo's Deinonychus has provided for us!! So much for thinking the Agent line was going to be weak! I wonder if the ExoForce style code brick number plate is a hint from TLC as to what will replace ExoForce at the end of this year? JB"
p12315
aS"Thanks for the great review! I'm really liking these agents sets the more i see them"
p12316
aS' The car seems to have alot of features'
p12317
aS" Its to bad the the ejection seat doesn't work as well as one would hope"
p12318
aS' Oh well'
p12319
aS' Makes me want the big rig even more now!'
p12320
aS"Looking closely at the red cones on the missles, and grey cones on the car's rear These appear to be a new piece"
p12321
aS' Note how there is a slight stopper ridge at the base of their top stud'
p12322
aS' Interestingly, the trans green cones on the helicopter seem to be of the older mould style'
p12323
aS'Thanks for your great review! It looks very nice indeed! The gate have very interesting mechanism'
p12324
aS' The car looks very slick and cool'
p12325
aS' It looks like those typical kind of James Bond car'
p12326
aS' This review gives me very good insights'
p12327
aS'Great review deinonychus I really like it! can someone record the sound os the sound brick(maybe on youtube?) I really want to hear it'
p12328
aS' This sets are really cool deino can you post a picture of the agent card it comes with?'
p12329
aS'Great review and fantastic pics, Deinonychus'
p12330
aS" And a big thank you to whoever pointed out that you could use the sound brick for Arkham Asylum, my addled brain didn't make the connection"
p12331
aS' The car is just beautiful, and with a good use for the most expensive part of the gate, this is on my wish list for sure, just have to see how much cash is left over after buying the new death star in a month or two'
p12332
aS" Agents has to be the biggest surprise from Lego for ages, without any pics it sounded so-so, but they've done a brilliant job with it, love those metallic coloured pieces!"
p12333
aS'great w, im totaly gonna buy this set'
p12334
aS'Great Review Thanks for sharing'
p12335
aS'Hello all Eurobricks members, I will present to you a very short review on the recent Castle Battlepacks'
p12336
aS' This time, I will be reviewing Skeleton Battlepack, and I hope everyone of you do enjoy viewing it'
p12337
aS' This was a request that put up by hollisbrick in the Castle thread'
p12338
aS' Initally, I thought it was a very simple set to do a review'
p12339
aS' However, for the love of Castle, I decided to whip this up for every Castle fan out there'
p12340
aS' This is an image of how the Skeleton Battlepacks look like'
p12341
aS' I have bought 12 last packs of these in total so far but none of the Crown battlepacks yet'
p12342
aS' There were snapped much faster, that I imagined'
p12343
aS' Do pardon me for the poor lightning'
p12344
aS" Today is a bad weather, it's hard to get natural light"
p12345
aS' The Skeleton Gang For a single battlepack like this, with an attractive reasonable price'
p12346
aS' You obtained a series of 5 skeleton mini-figs with tons and tons of useful castle accessories'
p12347
aS" To me, it's a very very great buy, and it's a MUST to stock up for my army building! Some add-ons! However, I was not very satisfied with my Skeleton armies standards"
p12348
aS' Therefore, I decided to make some slight modifications with some additional castle accessories that is stocked in my Castle warehouse'
p12349
aS' After the makeover, Ok, this is what I called a real skeleton army'
p12350
aS' This is mainly my opnion and it have to be aligned with my standards'
p12351
aS' I felt this improved battlepack gives a punch to the exisitng battlepack'
p12352
aS' The two soliders on the right, is able to align with the rest of my Castle Chess sets armies'
p12353
aS' While the one on the left, it gives me a great archer back up with the quiver and helmet attached to him'
p12354
aS' The ones, on the center especially the armored guard which equipped with the black nose cone helmet is my fave'
p12355
aS' It is able to illustrate the "Elite" among the rest of the guards with its armor and helmet which was featured in my Castle Deep Forest Expansion MOC'
p12356
aS' Promotion On! In addition, the one which was hastly done with a modify mace, it looks rather simple'
p12357
aS' In time to come, I will change it and gives a better equipment and look'
p12358
aS' These are the remains'
p12359
aS' I can use the axe for my dwarf in my dwarf mine defender'
p12360
aS' In that set, there is no weapon for my dwarf and I have to get it from other sets'
p12361
aS' The rest of the accessories, makes a very good stock up for future upgrading! Overall: 9/10 This is not a playset'
p12362
aS' It is mainly bought for its abilty to mass recurit any armies, and is a main love for all Castle Army builders such as me! This set mainly have no major faults, and I love it so much'
p12363
aS' Although, I have done some slight modifciations, but this set is a must for me to buy more and more! Meanwhile, I will need to wait for the next shipment! Hope everyone have enjoying viewing this simple review of mine! Edited by WhiteFang, 25 May 2008 - 12:52 PM'

aS' 7090 offer a joust divider, weapon rack (good accessories), 2 mini-figs, a horse with barding and a skeleton black horse'
p12438
aS' These sets have different purpose'
p12439
aS' For me, buying multiples of 7009 is to build its catapult, white skeleton calvaries'
p12440
aS' While 7090 is to build on Crown calvaries and Black skeleton calvaries'
p12441
aS' However, Battlepacks have a different agenda'
p12442
aS' It offered some castle accessories that is not available commonly'
p12443
aS' For a Castle army builder like myself, castle accessories are always in demand'
p12444
aS' The black robe, silver armor, silver short-axe are not very common castle accessories'
p12445
aS' It can be used as a good stock up too'
p12446
aS' I am not saying this battlepack is an one way solution to solve everything'
p12447
aS" That's why, different sets are released to target on different purposes"
p12448
aS"WhiteFang, although I realize that the battle packs are great specifically for building armies, and castle accessories (which is why its such a shame that I won't be able to buy these things ), while sdpirate's sets are more for a catapult, Calvary whatever"
p12449
aS' The fact to the matter is with the battle pack you get: 5 minifigs with lots of accessories'
p12450
aS' While with the sets that sdpirate showed us you get: 5 minifigs with an okay amount of accessories 3 horses (including two skeleton ones) A ballista A weapons rack, and a jousting barricade'
p12451
aS' You cannot say that the battle pack contains the same amount of stuff that the other two sets have and therefore should be priced the same'
p12452
aS' It just seems that Lego is ripping off Canadian army builders, to me if the battle pack contained a small catapult, or wall so that it contained about the same amount of stuff that the other sets had it would be fair'
p12453
aS' It seems stupid that you will only get minifigs from one set, while you can get about the same amount of minifigs plus a bunch of other stuff from two other equally priced sets'
p12454
aS' Thats why to me these battle packs are a rip off, because of what they contain, IMHO the Battle Packs seem to be only worth about 10 dollars'
p12455
aS'Thanks for the review Whitefang! Your additions look great, I like your mace much better than the use of a small technic cog, your looks much sturdier'
p12456
aS' And that helmet looks really great on skellie soldiers, I never thought to use that before'

p12462
aS' MacK, I can understand your concern when pricing is concerned'
p12463
aS' Pricing is always a big issue for us to determine whether to buy or not to buy a certain set in a particular country'
p12464
aS' Pricing varies differently across different countries such as US, Europe, Canada, Australia and etc'
p12465
aS' This is something very hard for us to decide on'
p12466
aS" We can't be sure why TLC placed their pricing strategies this way"
p12467
aS' Well, I think we should appericate what TLC is trying to do for us, by not using price as the only factor to judge whether to buy this set or not'
p12468
aS' At least, I am sure there are many of us trying to request for battlepacks to muster armies for their MOCs, Armies Collection and etc'
p12469
aS' Different people have different judgements towards different sets and different themes'
p12470
aS' I respect your opnion'
p12471
aS" IMO, let's don't let price be the only determined factor to decide whether to purchase a particular set or not"
p12472
aS' Instead, consider an array of factors that is offered'
p12473
aS' However, I do know that consumers like me and you are always affected by price'

p12601
aS' I saw the instructions of this set, but never atracted me Until now A great set an a excelente review'
p12602
aS'Thanks for reviewing this rare set! Since it came out in 1999 I have only seen this set in a toystore one single time, one single copy as well'
p12603
aS" It was in the summer of 1999 in Belgium (Arlon) in a store called 'Maxi Toys' (Belgiums TRu, I think)"
p12604
aS' They had the three biggest Junglesets for sale there: these Ancient Ruins, The set with the beautiful black boat and the zeppelin'
p12605
aS' Being into Adventurers at that time I had never seen the entire Jungle theme (not even in a leaflet or catalog) and surprised as I was I bought all three sets'
p12606
aS' That was one happy Dutch boy in Belgium! Surprisingly the two smallest sets made it in very small quantities to my local stores in Holland (except for the pontoon plane and small raft which was my very first Shop at Home order)'
p12607
aS" The spider's secret I bought off BL, which makes me the proud owner of the entire Jungle Serie"
p12608
aS" Back to the set: This was the first time in a long history of collecting Lego that I had a deformed piece: an 2x8 red plate was twisted, I twisted it back and it still serves it's purpose"
p12609
aS' I loved the whole steam-idea in this Jungle serie: the two boats both (including the one in this set) had nice steamengines and a very cool mechanic (yours has the wrong hat/hair btw) to come along with them'
p12610
aS' The skeleton falling down on the end of a chain was the most intriguing part of this set for me, it worked really well and when you were done scaring minifigures you could winch it up again ready for the next go'
p12611
aS' The only thing I did not really like about this set was the difference in wheelsize on the car, front small, back large and the way the palmtree consisted out of just three parts'
p12612
aS' All in all a great set that is becoming more rare and expensive as we speak/post'

p12621
aS' No, there are no stickers in this set'

aS' Also, simonwillems was correct; my mechanic is missing his hat, which should be a black kepi'

aS"Welcome to Cardinal Brick's Review of 7736 It's a small set but as I bought it the other day I felt that it probably did merit a short review"
p12671
aS" The box is ofcourse far larger than necessary! There's plenty of air inside"
p12672
aS' The contence is one bag and the instruction booklet, you could proably build it inside the bag if the desire took you'
p12673
aS' We have one new coastguard with the slightly stubly head found in the castle range and a trans-clear visor'
p12674
aS' The build was challanging and arduious The final product is quite nice at one ?3'
p12675
aS"00 it's a good set only 50p more than an impulse set and with enough extra parts to justify the increase in the price"
p12676
aS' A good set for a little gift or so on, the buggy moves well'
p12677
aS" There's not that much to say really for I can't really think of additional models to build with the parts but then what do you expect for the price"

p12687
aS'So i just piced up a new digital camera and i thought what better way to try it than doing a review of my newest set'
p12688
aS' The new 7738 Coast Guard Helicopter! itsmy first review, so go easy on me! lets start off with the small stuff'
p12689
aS' First the mini figs'
p12690
aS' You get 4 figs total'
p12691
aS' Two helicopter pilots, a diver and a civilan to rescue'
p12692
aS" The torso's are nothing new on the pilot and diver"
p12693
aS' Same ones as in the last coast guard line'
p12694
aS' But i like the colors alot better in this coast guard line than the previous generation'
p12695
aS' The yellow and blue really work well together and the coloring on the badge looks great! The civilian looks to be just a dock worker with an overall torso and a beenie'
p12696
aS' The diver has nice vented helmet and a pair of flippers that suits his duty perfect! Next we have an absolute work of lego art'
p12697
aS' The rescue raft! The orange flaps can be moved back for easy entry to the raft, as well as the white "support" beams with the caution tape'
p12698
aS" I put support in perenthaces cause they really don't support anything"
p12699
aS' Just there to fill in the gaps'
p12700
aS' At the top of the raft is a red locator beacon, ccommunications antenna, and a cargo loop for lifting the raft'
p12701
aS' lets move on to the interior of the raft'
p12702
aS' Not much here'
p12703
aS' But you can see the techinc beam that attaches to the top loop,and to the floor of the raft'
p12704
aS' So far this has proven to be very sturdy and has supported the full weight of the raft quite well'
p12705
aS' You can also see the white box that holds the equipment of the raft'
p12706
aS' Here you can see the life saver tube'
p12707
aS" Here's a shot with our dock worker peaking out the side"
p12708
aS' The raft says max ocupants 4, but with the storage box, that might be a tight fit'
p12709
aS' Now lets move on to the Helicopter! in my opinion this is one of the best helicopters TLC has come out with to date'
p12710
aS' I really felt they captured the look and proportions of a real Coast Guard helicopter'
p12711
aS' it uses a lower hull and tail section of the new airliner, and cargo airplane'
p12712
aS' It really seems to work well with this application'
p12713
aS' The engines have good detail using new "cheese graders" as vents, as well as the new engine stacks that come in the new speed racer sets'
p12714
aS' The rotors also appear to be new as well'
p12715
aS' lets move on to the cockpit'
p12716
aS' We have two seats for our pilots with a sticker sheet for intruments on a flat 4 wide plate'
p12717
aS" There's also an antena being used as a flight stick"
p12718
aS' Another shot with our pilots at the helm'
p12719
aS' Now lets moveon to the high lihgt of this heavy lifting machine'

p12726
aS" strechter doesn't include the ussually included fold away wheels"
p12727
aS" here's a shot with the winch arm extened ready for rescue! In the second shot you can see the drum that the wire coils up in"
p12728
aS' It coils up via a recently new power functions "pull" back motor'
p12729
aS' To operate, just pull out the winch cable, hook on your load, and presse this orange button on the side'
p12730
aS' The bad part of the new power functions winch is that although its very smooth in its operation, its not very strong'
p12731
aS' It will only lift the raft a couple inches before it runs out of torque'
p12732
aS' It also has a tendency to want to pull the crane arm backin while its lifting'
p12733
aS" It doesn't matter if its a light load, or heavy load"
p12734
aS' The bay doors open on both sides for easy postioning of the figures and accses to the strechter'

p12738
aS' The raft construction is very creative and is probbly the highlight of the set by itself'
p12739
aS' The helicopter is probbly one of the best, if not the best helicopter TLC has ever came out with if you can get over its size'
p12740
aS' in a scale of one to five'
p12741
aS' Price- Peice count- Playability- Design- overall- '
p12742
aS"5 I would have given it a full 5 out of five, but since the winch can't pull the raft all the way, it didn't fell it right"

aS' The set does include a 1x2 plate with a hinge for the diver to stand on so at least he can hold on to someone, the crane lifts them up and then he can put them in the strechter'
p12789
aS' Thats my guess at least'
p12790
aS" As far as the motor, i don't believe it uses bateries since you pull out the motor, and all the button does is recoil the winch line back in"

p12792

p12818
aS'This is a very good review, thank you! But I have some questions about the grey new parts in the life raft'
p12819
aS" Are they 1x1 like their counterparts with the clips or 1x2? And can they be held by a minifig by the handle? If so, these could be very useful for brick-build weapons & tools! Also, I'm looking forward to some orange ETA 2 Jedi Interceptor MOCs now! Who wants to be the first to make one? BTW, which Jedi has an orange ETA 2?"

aS' 101 Merlin and even that resemblance is very superficial'
p12828
aS' Just for the record: this is a Sikorsky Sea King and this is a Sikorsky MH-53 (a derivation of the CH-53)'
p12829
aS" The only resemblance I see with the former is the colour scheme and with the latter the fact that it's got a fat rear-end, sponsons and six blades"
p12830
aS" It doesn't matter though, because I really like it"
p12831
aS" The colour scheme is great, the shape is nice, it's got quite a bit of detail and I just have to get my hands on the cockpit window and those new rotor blades"
p12832
aS" When I first saw the large aircraft pieces a few years ago I figured they were very much single-use parts, but the tail end doesn't look too bad"
p12833
aS' Pretty clever'
p12834
aS' I like the raft too'
p12835
aS' It really does look like the real deal'
p12836
aS" That the helicopter can't lift it really isn't an issue, because in real life they wouldn't lift the raft either"
p12837
aS" They'd use the rescue hoist to lift the occupants of the raft into the helicopter one by one (or perhaps in pairs)"
p12838
aS' Imagine a storm with a helicopter hovering over tall waves with a big fat raft strung from a cable underneath it'
p12839
aS' The raft would catch a lot of wind and flop around quite a bit, causing it to loose all its occupants and also yanking the helicopter around, possibly causing the pilot to loose control and crash'

aS' A shame that this set, as all other Batman sets, have gone up so highly in value but still all things considering (general after market Lego price hikes) it is still a wonderfull set even with its market value today (that is if you can ignore the MRSP)'

aS'Great Review of a great set'
p12941
aS' I always figured the hoses were welding torches (attached to jetpacks, yeah!) as the whole thing had the vibe of a mobile repair center'
p12942
aS' Much like many of my favorite sets, this one has a base of simple bricks and plates and then from that solid foundation the rest is built out to be decorative or have the action features'
p12943
aS' This gives sets a very solid feel as demonstrated in this set, the first Snowspeeder, and Galaxy Explorer'
p12944
aS' The MM Armored Drilling Unit has a more technic base giving it a less solid appearance and though I like the set, that jet that luanches from the back is horrible, partially because of the useless orange containment things'
p12945
aS' The Mega Core has a nifty crane instead of a big useless jet'
p12946
aS' -Tohst'

aS'Sinner, on May 28 2008, 02:35 PM, said: Care to explain why? The MCM has a pure weight of parts that I find hard to quantify but love'
p12948
aS' It is just so dense when you build it, full of nice surprises, no technique required, and a wonderful stearing mechanism that I rank as more important than the suspension of the mars version'
p12949
aS' This thing was meant to crush anyway, who needs suspension? I also like the way you never felt that the M-trons deserved a base after building this, it was that good'
p12950
aS' The colour scheme was perfect'

aS' Lots of playing possibilities! I wish I had it too'
p12958
aS"Fun review, thanks! Kinda sad to think that with TLC's recent ban on magnets in their products, we'll never see an M:Tron revival "
p12959
aS'I love the design of the front canopy of this set, but I always felt that they could have done more with the rest of the model'
p12960
aS' This set is good candidate for customization though'
p12961
aS' There is quite a bit on unused space inside, especially in the middle section'
p12962
aS' I want to try putting a Technic-style engine into mine at some point, along with the necessary gearing'
p12963
aS' I got my MCM brand new off ebay some years ago for a pretty good price, but the box was very worn out and the big trans-neon panel, which floats freely inside the box, was a bit damaged'
p12964
aS' As for the hose/jetpack things, I always assumed that they were either welding torches or flamethrowers'

aS" You're right, I should have clarified -- it's the old loose magnets that apparently are being discontinued, not all magnets altogether"
p12976
aS' As you noted, the new train couplings still have magnets, but they appear to be permanently attached to a fairly large housing, which I guess will prevent kids from eating them'

aS' The figure is very true to the character, and the torso has been accented with a few shape lines to try and distinguish her as a female despite the boxy body'
p13137
aS' Harleys jester cap is an interesting new piece'
p13138
aS' It seems (to me at least) to be made of a slightly different grade of plastic then were used to'
p13139
aS' Its molded in red and painted with black and white, and it comes packed in its own separate little baggie'
p13140
aS' I expect that this piece may have cost LEGO a little more then usual to produce'
p13141
aS' Harley also has a buildable accessory, a giant mallet'
p13142
aS' Sure, she cant stand up all that well unless its held in specific ways, but its neat and most importantly, its funny'
p13143
aS' Its especially fun for smacking the everloving crap out of other Minifigs with'
p13144
aS' The Bat Cycle is in bag number one and is a very fast build'
p13145
aS' This isnt some little Japanese sport bike like Nightwings cycle'
p13146
aS' This monster is almost a car and seems to pack just the right amount of intimidation for the Caped Crusader to exploit'
p13147
aS' Thanks to the thick tires (two in front, one in back) it stands up just fine on its own and rolls very well'
p13148
aS' The huge exhaust pipes are a nice touch and give the thing a look of engine power'
p13149
aS' The only real flaw is the inclusion of the flick-fire missiles mounted on the sides'
p13150
aS' But, as with any LEGO model, they can be easily left out without hurting the look of the vehicle'
p13151
aS' The hammer truck is the bulk of this set and a lot more fun then it looks'
p13152
aS' Of the monster truck persuasion, the vehicle is designed and built with a surprising level of solidity'
p13153
aS' The axle mounts are particularly impressive'
p13154
aS' The big wheels and tires just beg you to drive this thing right over the Bat Cycle (or Batman)'
p13155
aS' The mega-mallet gimmick is also a surprise'
p13156
aS' Not so much for its technical complexity, there isnt any really, but for the fact that once you start turning the knob at the rear to swing the mallet back and forth, its really a lot of fun'
p13157
aS' There are some low points to the truck design'
p13158
aS' Again the flick-fire missiles are tacked on and theres a cargo crate/bed set into the back for Harleys loot of jewels'
p13159
aS' The crate would have looked a lot better molded in black'
p13160
aS' In brown it breaks up the look of the truck a little'
p13161
aS' Speaking of which, the look of the truck is very pleasing'
p13162
aS' The red and black Harley Quinn color scheme works really well on the vehicle'
p13163
aS' There are a few stickers here, and unfortunately, the diamond patterned ones are applied over multiple bricks'
p13164
aS' The rest, however, are great'
p13165
aS' Not only does she have an I Love Joker bumper sticker, but she has a Joker playing card taped to her dash, I guess serving as a picture of her beloved Puddin'
p13166
aS' There is also a sticker for activation of the hammer, which boldly shouts HIT ME! This is a fun set'
p13167
aS' A neat new Batman vehicle and a big truck with lots of playability'
p13168
aS' The Harley Minifig is a must-have for any Bat-Fan and, if you only get one of the Batman sets this year, Id recommend this one'
p13169
aS' The price versus piece-count on this set is a little bit of a deterrent though'
p13170
aS' This might not be the best set for collectors on a budget or people looking for something completely new and innovative, but anyone buying this for a child can rest assured that the kid will get your moneys worth out of the set through its play value'
p13171
aS' When added together and averaged out, the pros and cons of this set combine to give it a score of out of 5'
p13172
aS' Even if Harley herself is a clean 6 out of 5'
p13173
aS'Darn you! Making us wait like this'

p13194
aS'Quote Looking forward to the review, this looks to be the best of the new Batsets'
p13195
aS' *gasp* Are you kidding me? Honestly, I hate this set'
p13196
aS' The batbike looks far too blocky, and that Hammer Truck looks super shoddy and thrown together'
p13197
aS" The only real reason I'd get it at all would be for the Harely Quinn figure - but I'd probably just get her separately on Bricklink"
p13198
aS" Besides, the Tumbler and Robin's Jetski sets look far better to me"
p13199
aS' They actually seem to have great vehicle designs'
p13200
aS' No new villian figures, I know, but still some great old ones'

p13213
aS" Add into the fact it has Harley, great wheels, a modable Batbike, awesome stickers and awesome pieces and I'd say this was a win"
p13214
aS' The Penguin is a bit of a repeat and the Tumbler is too big for me'
p13215

p13228

p13243

p13255
aS'Thanks for the review Deinonychus! This is an awesome set, It may just be my first Batman set'
p13256
aS'Hi all, so I was at "The Wal-Mart" yesterday and had the munchies and was looking for something to eat'
p13257
aS' Somewhere along the line, I stopped caring about food and decided to browse the toy department to see what they had Lego-wise'
p13258
aS' Usually, they have jack squat, but on this particular day they had a lot of new sets'
p13259
aS" I impulsively picked this set up, along with Harley Quinn's Hammer Truck and the new little campsite from the Indy 4 line"
p13260
aS" I must say, when I first saw images of this set I wasn't exactly thrilled or anything"
p13261
aS" I mean, I didn't really see anything particularly special about it, but after purchasing it, I must admit that I would consider it a must buy for any Lego fan"
p13262
aS' But enough babbling about myself'
p13263
aS' Onward with the review (my first of an official set)! In this picture, you can see everything you get with the set'
p13264
aS' I thought the box-art was pretty nice looking'
p13265
aS' The manual, on the other hand, took somewhat of a beating within the box, a common problem with most more recent sets'
p13266
aS' I do have to say that I wish they would at least make some effort in fixing this'
p13267
aS' They could just make a little thin cardboard "folder" to minimize bending and tears'
p13268
aS" For Batman minifig collector's, the highlight of this set are the Robin and Penguin figs"
p13269
aS' Previously, you could only get them in the pricey Bat-Cave set, but this set provides a much cheaper alternative'
p13270
aS" One thing you will notice, however, is that Robin's hairpiece is a new mold, as it is actually a black version of Mutt's hair (from the Indy 4 line)"
p13271
aS' Personally, I think it actually looks better than the hairpiece used on the older version of Robin'
p13272
aS' As the Batcave had before it, this set comes with some bricks to make two cute (but deadly) penguins'
p13273
aS' They help add more charm to an already charming set'
p13274
aS' When you\'re finished building, you\'ll end up with a nice little assortment of extra parts; 1 black "cheese slope," 3 1x1 tile (black, yellow and white), a revolver, a technic pin, and a 1x1 red round plate'
p13275
aS" Here's Robin's Scuba Jet"
p13276
aS" It's nice and sleek looking"
p13277
aS' Notable parts of interest would probably be the green turbine engines'
p13278
aS' My only complaint on this one would have to be the use of decals on the 2x2 round yellow tiles'
p13279
aS' For that type of a part, printing seems as though it would have been the best way to go'
p13280
aS' Now for, in my opinion, the best part of the set'
p13281
aS"the Penguin's sub"
p13282
aS" This set has more decals than Robin's Scuba Jet, but they seem more necessary in this case"
p13283
aS" I actually wanted to put the decal's on the sub, as I think the it looks great with them"
p13284
aS' Obviously, it looks like a penguin, but wow, does it ever do it with style! It has a lot of interactive features, the first of which I will mention, being the periscope which raises up and down'
p13285
aS' And for the collectors of parts in new colors, it has a few parts in medium orange?, such as 2x2 tile'
p13286
aS" Here's a shot of the bottom of the sub"
p13287
aS' Another nifty little feature is how you can lift the top off and fit the penguin inside'
p13288
aS' And there is enough room inside, so that you can firmly place top on again, and without interference to the movement of the periscope'
p13289
aS' Another little feature is the rear spring-loaded missile'
p13290
aS' You just tilt the small lever toward the front of the sub, and it fires'
p13291
aS' And the last small feature are the flick-missiles on each side'
p13292
aS' Overall, this is a great set with a lot to offer for a decent price'
p13293
aS' A lot of fans might view the only drawback to it as being the use of decals, but if you plan on keeping the kit together they make it look really fantastic'
p13294
aS' Buy it if you can'

p13328
aS" The inclusion of The Penguin, Robin and two of those great brick-built penguins really confirms that I'll be getting this, considering that I didn't purchase the Batcave"
p13329
aS' However, I am rather dissapointed that this set is so similar to the vehicles of Penguin and Robinin repectively in the Batcave set'
p13330
aS" I feel that it only really caters to those who havn't bought the set, and I would've much appreciated different vehicles"
p13331

aS"I was never considering getting this set as I don't really like Batman, but if I found this set and had some money with me, I would buy it! Ii would use it for Indiana JOnes or something, and the revolevers and Top hats! The only problem I see with the box-art is that the penguin is drowning!"
p13334
aS'Looks like a cool set, but the hairpiece for Robin is vary disapointing, I would be so glad is they used the regular hair you see all the time'

p13340
aS'99 Those dedicated Agents'
p13341
aS" They've fought chainsaw-armed villains, battled radio-controlled cyborg crocs, chased pallets of badly-stored golden loot and wrestled killer sharks with vicious, toothy grins"
p13342
aS" Finally they've caught the notorious Dr Inferno and imprisoned him in their cavernous Mobile Command Center"
p13343
aS" But Dr Inferno won't go down without a fight! Can the Agents stop the evil Dr 'Disco' Inferno fleeing? Will Spy Clops laser gun burn through the door in time, or will Dr Inferno simply use the lovely Agent Trace's enormous ponytail as an escape ladder to freedom? More importantly, will there be a riot in the streets of Lego City as AFOLs go apopletic at the thought of a 12 wide truck roaring through their ordered town layouts? Stay tuned! Part 1: The Box, Instructions, Parts As the largest of the Agents sets (so far), the box is easily the biggest"
p13344
aS' Trainee agents, examine the following three pics and see if you notice anything odd'
p13345
aS" Box front: Box back: Box middle: Spot it? That's right"
p13346
aS' The printed cardboard which has supposed to be the bottom half of the fold out middle section is on the back, slicing the ultra-large set image which would form the foldout in half '
p13347
aS" The way the cardboard is printed as one piece before it's folded I think this would be very hard to do 'accidentally' so suspect a major stuff-up somewhere along the production line"
p13348
aS' I bought this set off bricklink so would be very interested if anyone in the States who has seen these boxes actually on the shelves can tell me if this is common or rare'
p13349
aS" Basically I want to know if I should be annoyed that the bricklink seller didn't list this in the set description, or are they all like this? The instructions come in 4 booklets"
p13350
aS' The parts list comes in at 5 pages, which is a lot even at half-size pages ! Large images of the parts inventory are in this folderwhen moderated for anyone interested'
p13351
aS" Here's also some cute Agents-type artwork at the end of one of the books"
p13352
aS' Instructions show piece call-outs and are divided into sections according to numbered bags'
p13353
aS" As you'd expect for a set with 1100+ parts, this baby comes with a lot of bags"
p13354
aS" It's a treasure trove of dark blue"
p13355
aS' As well as the obvious large slopes and wall panels which make up the body and the roof, there is a wealth of smaller navy blue pieces as well - small 1x1 bricks, 2x2 bricks, 1x1 plates, 2x2 tiles, heaps of 2x plates, some slopes, 22x cheese pieces'
p13356
aS' basically anyone wanting a lot of dark blue should think about this set'
p13357
aS' The roof panels alone, for example, could provide a dark blue sea for a modernised Pirate MOC'
p13358
aS' 2 DSSs (Dreaded Sticker Sheets)'
p13359
aS' Quelle surprise - stickers! The grey parts of the stickers here are metallic silver ink, which is a nice touch'
p13360
aS" Actually, as sticker sheets go, they're not too bad"
p13361
aS' Fairly subtle for the most part and the navy blue actually matches the bricks themselves'
p13362
aS' However, after looking at the sticker sheets I thought I was missing something'
p13363
aS" What about the pieces used for the projection screens showing Dr Inferno and the sharks - why weren't they on the sticker sheets? There must be another one! Frantically I checked and rechecked the box and flipped through all the instruction manuals to find the elusive 3rd sheet"
p13364
aS' Where was it? Ten minutes later I noticed something which had honestly never occured to me - THERE WERE ACTUAL PRINTED PIECES IN THIS SET! So obvious and yet so unthinkable'
p13365
aS" It's horrifying how years and years of Exoforce and Speed Racer set releases can mentally condition people's thought processes"

p13369
aS') I also noticed this nifty modification of the usual 2x3 cupboard - you can now fit drawers in it! Very clever'
p13370
aS" This may have been around in Belville sets for years for all I know, but it's new to me"
p13371
aS' The drawers slide in and out very well and the top one sits on slight indentations in the middle of the cupboard'
p13372
aS' Part 2: The figs! Our trusty agents - Charge, Chase, Trace and Fuse'
p13373
aS" (High powered agents don't have time for names of more than one syllable - that's why the bad guys always lose )"
p13374
aS' Chase and Fuse have the Mutt hair in black and dark orange'
p13375
aS" The lovely Agent Trace has an exquisite new hairpiece in dark brown, perfect for 'Rapunzel' themed MOCs"
p13376
aS' As you can see, her ponytail is loooong'
p13377
aS' Makes it hard to sit down, the poor girl'
p13378
aS' I feel sorry for all these female figs with such intricate hairstyles that they can never relax in an ordinary Lego chair'
p13379
aS' However, at least she has two breasts unlike the recent Harley Quinn fig'
p13380
aS' Compensation indeed'
p13381
aS" Seriously though, it's great that there's a separate torso print for the female character and this attention to detail is typical of the set as a whole"
p13382
aS' Three of the agents have reversable heads - nice touch with the headsets and I like the ID cards on their pants'
p13383
aS' Obviously the agents security system is based on some kind of crotch measuring device'
p13384
aS" This would make sense considering the conspicuous bulges in the pants of Dr Inferno's men (see the other Agents set reviews"
p13385
aS') The villains - Spy Clops, Dr Inferno, Gold Tooth'
p13386
aS" Dr Inferno's hair in all it's glory"
p13387
aS' This is a great piece, although the orange colouring is a little rough on the front'
p13388
aS" It's so 3D, it deserves a back and side view (and indeed EB thread) all of its own"
p13389
aS" As mentioned elsewhere, this is different plastic to the normal minifig hair, but it doesn't quite feel as soft as the Exo-force hair"
p13390
aS" It doesn't fall off as much, anyway"
p13391
aS' The figs get 10/10 from me'
p13392
aS' Awesome hairpieces in great colours for the Agents and a sleek navy blue/ neon green uniform'
p13393
aS" The villains' faces are great and they are all very distinctive"
p13394
aS" The attention to detail is outstanding and it's great to see a Lego in-house theme with characters as memorable and cool as figs from the licensed themes "
p13395
aS' Part 3: The build The build is divided into three stages - the small vehicles, the front of the truck, and the massive command center section'
p13396
aS' (a) Small vehicles First up, all the small vehicles'
p13397
aS' We have a small flyer, 2 buggies, jet ski, and a speed boat - all in glorious navy blue with little bits of silver detailing'
p13398
aS' Top view'
p13399
aS' These vehicles are all simple, small and well-designed'
p13400
aS' Probably the weakest is the flyer, only because the cockpit looks a little large'
p13401
aS' In fact, the small flyer is probably the weakest element of 8365 overall, which tells you how good the set itself is! In various threads here, this set has been heavily criticised for being way out of proportion'
p13402
aS" There's a reason for that, as we shall come to"
p13403
aS' However, the existence of these small sets should appease some people'
p13404
aS" With the new coast guard sets, for example, all of these save the flyer wouldn't look out of place on a City beach with a little modding"
p13405
aS" Here's an example - agents beach party! (Spongebob couldn't help but crash"
p13406
aS") The villains only have one small vehicle, but they've been well-served in the smaller sets, and this one is a unique and clever design"
p13407
aS' I love the triangular shape and the simple but clever technique of making the arch slopes meet up around the propellers'
p13408
aS" It's sort of insectile in black and orange, and looks very different from the usual assortment of helicopters etc"
p13409
aS' (b) Truck front This thing is a beast! Seriously, look at it'
p13410
aS" It's chunky and mean looking"
p13411
aS" You don't want to mess with this baby"
p13412
aS' The build is really nice'
p13413
aS" Like a lot of Star Wars vehicles, it's all based on technic beams pinned together"
p13414
aS" Unlike a lot of Mars Mission sets, underneath isn't ALL technic beams with some plates slapped on like a facade"
p13415
aS' The majority is a lot of plates and bricks which all fit together solidly'
p13416
aS" You can see from the detailing of 'cheese grater' slopes and silver pieces on the front how effort has been made to give this vehicle a distinct feel different to other Lego sets"
p13417
aS' Sure, the silver slope mirrors might be a bit too much for some, but this baby is all about attitude'
p13418
aS" You can imagine it roaring down the road en route to Dr Inferno's diabolical lair! After all, these sets are 'Agents' sets - nobody said they were *secret* Agents (c ) Command center - whole assembly Here's a view of the whole thing assembled - inside and cool details to follow at the end"
p13419
aS" It's kind of hard to show here as it is extreeeeemely long"
p13420
aS' This is indeed a big set'
p13421
aS' The build for the trailer part of the command center is fun and very satisfying'
p13422
aS' Yes, there are large pieces but there is also a huge amount of detail'
p13423
aS' It is also solid as a rock'
p13424
aS' I remember being annoyed building the big Ferrari truck a few years ago - everytime you looked at it, an 8 x 16 plate fell off'
p13425
aS' The Mobile Command Center is solid - even with the hinged roof and special features, it is not delicate at all'
p13426
aS' Kudos to the designers, again as it is mainly a brick build rather than a technic one'
p13427
aS" I also like how the command center part connects to the cabin - it's not a special piece at all, just a technic axle going through two circle plates, but it works and it's solid"
p13428
aS" (Please note I've been selective about which stickers I've applied during the build"
p13429
aS") Top view: The rear: Here's an example of why I like the build: (a) the designers have enough sense to put a ladder so a minifig can climb up to the interior when the command center is open (b) notice that although the ladder clips at the top, there is an *extra* clip there in the middle purely to hold it in place so it doesn't flap around and holds firm"
p13430
aS" I don't know if most designers would even think to put a ladder there let alone go the extra mile and put a mechanism to hold it in place"
p13431
aS' Pure class'
p13432
aS' Oh, and notice the greebly detail stuff to the right there too'
p13433
aS' The other side'
p13434
aS' This is probably the other weak part of the build - the bricky gaps at the top where the hinge to open the roof sits'
p13435
aS" It's a little gappy but the set is so big you don't really notice"
p13436
aS" (d) And now for the fun stuff - inside and neat details! OK, so we've built the thing"
p13437
aS" It's big"
p13438
aS" It's blue"
p13439
aS' The top of the trailer itself would make a good warehouse MOC for a harbour layout'
p13440
aS" But what about inside? Is it any good? What about all those small vehicles from the start of the review? Where do they go? Well, I'm glad you asked"
p13441
aS' Because the solution is superb'
p13442
aS" The small flyer folds slightly and slides into place here: Lift off the roof and you're away! The large buggy and the speedboat go under here: The jetski slides out of the rear here, attached to its own little platform: And the small buggy goes inside the main cabin"
p13443
aS" There's even a crane so you can lift it down"
p13444
aS" So now we know why this set is so large! To fit everything in! It's amazing that this functionality doesn't affect the aesthetics of the set as a whole"
p13445
aS" But we still haven't finished on the details"
p13446
aS" The front section has a very easy-to-swing-open roof section and missiles: There's also a command section underneath the bit where the flyer lifts out: And now for the interior"
p13447
aS' I have to say I really like this space'
p13448
aS" Not only is it packed with great stuff, there's also enough room for minifigs to move around"
p13449
aS' I hate bases where the figs only have about 2 studs to actually stand and walk'
p13450
aS' Aquabase Invasion is a nice set, for example, but the actual functional space inside the base is teensy'
p13451
aS" Claustrophobia! You know within a week they'd be fighting to toss each other out of the airlock"
p13452
aS' No such problems for these suave Agents, who have plenty of legroom *and* the ability to launch missiles from their ceiling'
p13453
aS' The whole of the interior: Zooming in: Moving from left to right'
p13454
aS' First off, the medicine cabinet'
p13455
aS" Looks like someone's been leaving secret mission dossiers lying around"
p13456
aS' The projector area for mission briefings'
p13457
aS' Dr Inferno recently changed his hair colour from purple to orange, it seems'
p13458
aS' Why are all these minifigs so obsessed with their hair? The projector folds down when the trailer is open'
p13459
aS' Push the button and the light glows on'
p13460
aS" Now Dr Inferno's hair is orange again! This is one of my favourite parts of the set"
p13461
aS' It works a charm'
p13462
aS' The batteries for these lightbricks can also be replaced - instructions are in the manual'
p13463
aS' Agent Charge considers shark-fin soup for dinner'
p13464
aS' Did I mention these projection panels are printed? The detail is very fine too'
p13465
aS' The tool section'
p13466
aS' Laptops sit in the middle compartment'
p13467
aS' You get some flippers, yellow scuba tank and various implements'
p13468
aS" I'm so impressed that the helmet is pearl silver with a different coloured visor too - there's so much variation in the parts in this set, you don't get the sense the designers are using the same thing over and over to save money"
p13469
aS' It all feels luxe and top-of-the-line, just like the Command Center itself'
p13470
aS' Two laptops - yay! The aforementioned rooftop missiles: The Dr Inferno cage'
p13471
aS' Nasty electric shocks! Bzzt! (You can see my reviewing skills are burning out now - sentences'
p13472
aS' truncated'
p13473
aS") Another example of detail - nowhere else in the set is a 1x1 transgreen tile used - they could have used a 1x1 trans green cheese wedge piece as there are others in the set, but they didn't"
p13474
aS' How does Dr I get out? Flick that lever on the right hand exterior and the door pops open'
p13475
aS' Spy Clops the loyal minion awaits his master on the other side'
p13476
aS' And there we have it'
p13477
aS" Take a bow, guys! There's a lot of spare parts"
p13478
aS" A suspicious amount of dark blue small slopes but I checked the instructions and didn't see anything missing"
p13479
aS' I have to say, I do like the new policy (since Speed Racer I think) of including these small slopes as extras'
p13480
aS" Part 4: Overall Rating If you've made it this far, you've got more stamina than Dr Inferno's army of cyborg animals themselves! As I said earlier, this set has drawn criticism for the size of the truck"
p13481
aS' However, large vehicles do exist - I grew up in a wheat farming area and as a kid the size of the lorries that thundered past carrying grain was probably intimidating to me as this monstrous espionage machine is to the good citizens of Lego City! On top of that, it *does* contain a plethora of 4-wide vehicles inside ! Criticism of this set on the basis of size to me also seems misguided as this is basically a playset - and it is a very good one to boot'
p13482
aS" As you can probably tell, I love it to pieces and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone, whether for parts or for play value"
p13483
aS' Check out the parts list in this folderwhen moderated and you can see just how many excellent pieces it contains'
p13484
aS" A light-up brick, a flood of navy blue, metallic silver bricks - we're spoiled"
p13485
aS' 8635 is also an enjoyable build, with fantastic figs and top-of-the-line detailing'
p13486
aS" In a year when I've found City a bit disappointing after the run of great sets in 2006-2007, the Agents line has been one of the surprise hits for me and I can't wait to see what the designers come up with next"

p13505
aS'Me want this set'
p13506
aS"You know I like many had doubt's about these sets when they were first mentioned, but I've decided I want the whole line now! This set is the crme de la crme"
p13507
aS' Just beautifully stunning! That is a great review svelte_corps, you have gone into fantastic detail and description of all the elements'
p13508
aS' Really it is this review that has persuaded me to buy this set'
p13509
aS' I blame you! The minifigs are great, the vehicles are better, and the truck and interior is awesome! The few minor draw backs are far outweighed by the attention to detail and the many unique and cool elements used in this set'
p13510
aS' And printed pieces! That is even better! Great job, you have obviously put a tremendous effort in making this review, and I for one definitely appreciate it! I am looking forward to these sets being available in New Zealand!'

p13522
aS'Wow'
p13523
aS' Like others have said i was unsure about these when i first heard about them but then looked at the first leaked pics and thought they actually look pretty neat'
p13524
aS' now i have seen all the reviews i have to have all these sets'
p13525
aS" at first i was thinking they would be great as parts packs but the more reviews i see the less i want to use them as part packs and just keep them as built (or buy 2 so i can do both !!) Can't wait till they hit the shelves in the UK"
p13526
aS' Thanks for the review'
p13527
aS"That's an AWESOME review"
p13528
aS' And a great set, it seems'
p13529
aS" With all of this year's Star Wars (I still haven't got Rogue Shadow) I can't afford Agents too, which is a shame looking at this"
p13530
aS'Wow! Great review of what seems to be a great set'
p13531
aS' I love that ponytail'
p13532
aS" This looks to be a must have set! (It probably won't stay together for long though"
p13533
aS') Thanks very much'

p13539
aS' Its simply fabulous! Thanks for your hard work'
p13540
aS" I am sure it's not easy to do this review"

aS' She looks awfully sweet especially with her new hair'
p13543
aS' Great job!'
p13544
aS'OMG! Thank you, thank you, thank you! You made my day! So that means Dr'
p13545
aS" Inferno's hair isnt rubber! But one question, is it like that weird funny soft plastic like the ants from Indy 4? PLEASE ANSWER"
p13546
aS'Thanks for another wonderful review, svelte_corps A very fine set indeed, I absolutely love the way all of the vehicles fit into the command centre, very clever'
p13547
aS' The projector is really cool, it looks very nice'
p13548
aS" It's great to see these light and sound bricks in the Agents sets"
p13549
aS' All of the little nooks and crannies in the centre are great too, I really love the amount of detail featured, mixed with all of the playability of this set'
p13550
aS' The minifigs - as usual - are brilliant, the uniforms look fantastic'
p13551
aS" Dr Inferno looks especially great, I love his white suit with hints of orange, and who can forget his hair? I'm really tempted to buy this beast now, though I'm not sure my wallet will forgive me for it"
p13552
aS" I suppose I'll have to cut back on Indy and Castle multiples for now"
p13553
aS' Thanks for the truly great review, svelte_corps, nice work'
p13554
aS"Wow this set looks so amazing! Amazing! Genius! Da'vinci art I say! You've done an excellent job reviewing, and really, this is the review I've been waiting for"
p13555
aS' So cool! So classy! I love the mission briefing feature'
p13556
aS" To think that lego could go so high as to put something ingenious like that in there! Too bad Lego figures don't have fingers to make shadow shows, eh? Genius! The Jet lauching feature is pretty slick, and they even put a control center in there too! That's beast"
p13557
aS' Loving that'
p13558
aS' The bottom'
p13559
aS"I don't see how that big buggy can get out or in there, but, Awesome too! The back of the truck could use more detailing I think, but the jail pop-open feature is pretty cool, as is the speed boat storage rack"
p13560
aS" Cabin; it's great! That roof opening feature is a great part of this set"
p13561
aS' Also I think you can have multiple figures up there'
p13562
aS"maybe you can mod it to put a bed in there! It certainly looks big enough! Inferno plane, wow that think is smooth, baby! I love how the wings contain rotors inside of them!!! That's awesome detail right there"
p13563
aS' That is a sweet ship thingy, so slick'
p13564
aS" The rest of the command center is pretty awesome too; we get a 4x4 wheeler and a crane, and lots of room! Wow! Just wow! Great review, great set! You are well worthy of your custom title! I'm gonna go buy this for only $90!!!! WOOT!"
p13565
aS"Great Review, thanks! That's one hell of a set"
p13566
aS' I think LEGO has reached a certain kind of peak with the design, cleverness, and fun of this one'
p13567
aS" I'm so relieved that Agents seems to be shaping up to be even better then I thought it was going to be"
p13568
aS'and I thought it was going to be cool to begin with'
p13569
aS' Agent "Charge"? Not only does he look like Dash Justice, but he has the name of one of Dash\'s Alpha Team squadmates? I call shenanigans!'
p13570
aS'Woah, I got to have this set! I shall buy it ASAP! Thanks for the review! Expertly done'
p13571
aS'Splendid review! I love everything on this set'
p13572
aS" No question 'bout it"
p13573
aS' Somehow I knew I should have saved up and buy that when come to TRU'
p13574
aS'but the sight of Turbocar Chase and Jetpack Pursuit was to tempting to pass up'
p13575
aS"Wonderful review - one of the best I've ever seen on this site"
p13576
aS" Man, we thought this might be the weakest set in the line, but it turns out it may be the strongest! Everything about this set - from the color scheme to all the details to the minifigures to the piece selection - is just wonderful! I think this set has finally confirmed it: Agents is everything Alpha Team wasn't, and is how they should have done a spy theme from the start"
p13577
aS" Kudos to TLC for finally getting it right - and I sure hope there's a second year!"
p13578
aS'wow, excellent review, thanks'
p13579
aS' That set sure looks fantastic'

p13594
aS' I really like how the small vehicles all fit into the truck'

aS') Part 1: Box, Instructions, DSSs (Dreaded Sticker Sheets), Parts Front of box: Back of box: 2 x instruction booklets: DSS numero uno - for the Reaper DSS number two - apologies for the blurry pic but I wanted to capture the sweet shimmy of the metallic holographic background on this sheet The way it catches the light really makes a difference to the small alien craft and makes it look much more interesting from the plain stickers of last year'
p13608
aS" There's heaps of spare silvery stuff once the stickers are applied for those who use the leftover sticker material for customising"
p13609
aS" Parts bags - 4 numbered with one extra with larger pieces Parts everywhere - woo! I know the Lego instruction books scold me if I mix bags, but I'm a devil-may-care kind of guy"
p13610
aS' In your face, TLC'
p13611
aS" I love mixing all the parts together before I build, it reminds me of my youth when the days were long, anything was possible, and I didn't need strict instructions not to build on grass or poke my eye out with a technic shooter"
p13612
aS' Interesting parts - these may or may not be new, my technic knowledge is not that detailed'
p13613
aS' The little scoop parts are so cute and have a heap of potential uses'
p13614
aS" I love 'em"
p13615
aS" They're like Smurf hats at Miniland scale"
p13616
aS' These technic wheel things in orange are also cute'
p13617
aS' They kind of remind me of marigolds'
p13618
aS" Giant Fabuland marigolds! The track pieces - you get 70 of these - here's the section of track for one side - as you can see it's about 52 studs long"
p13619
aS' These hold together better than the small ones on the Hailfire Droid/ Jungle Cutter'
p13620
aS' Part 2: Minifigs, small mining transport, alien ship I have to confess - I forgot to take an individual snap of the astronauts '
p13621
aS" It's the usual bunch though - Scaredy Face guy, Sunglasses in Space Man and a third one I can't remember"
p13622
aS" You don't really care, though? You're only interested in the alien commander and his matching arms/ legs combo deal"
p13623
aS' As brickbitz noted in his review of the smaller set, the glowy eye is just a 1x1 cylinder'
p13624
aS' The set also comes with 2 normal jellies - one pictured here for size'
p13625
aS" You'll see what happened to the other one soon enough"
p13626
aS' The alien craft is nothing exciting, apart from the gorgeous glinting stickers'
p13627
aS" Here's the road safety angle"
p13628
aS" The commander actually clips onto a 1x2 plate with handle so he can't fall out! Then the lime tentacle thing descends on top of him to keep him firmly there, like a baby seat"
p13629
aS' Not very brave for an alien commander, is he? I mean, did Darth Vader ever use a seatbelt? Tssk'
p13630
aS' With cradle up: This part of the build also includes the small astronaut mining buggy - small and effective'
p13631
aS" (Please note in this build I've applied stickers to everything bar cockpit pieces"
p13632
aS') This comes with radio and saw piece'
p13633
aS' Part 3: The Reaper! The first part of the build is the detachable shuttle'
p13634
aS' I really like the retro aesthetic of this with the angled wings and the side hoverpod things'
p13635
aS' It is much better than the comparable vehicle from 7699'
p13636
aS" The new flickfire piece is a waste of space - it's fairly limp"
p13637
aS' I prefer the simple flickfire technic pin to be honest'
p13638
aS" There's also a very nice little side workshop as you can see"
p13639
aS" I really like how the control unit is 'plugged' into the wall via 5 1x1 round plates (third pic, it's a bit dark)"
p13640
aS' Great detail'
p13641
aS' [The technic pins on the back are there to connect the Power Functions battery box'
p13642
aS" It's odd they're included at this stage of the instructions - maybe the intention was to release it originally with all the necessary motors etc but the price point was too high and they scaled it back] The base"
p13643
aS' The shuttle sits on that bley technic axle in the middle when the Reaper is fully assembled'
p13644
aS' The little vehicle scoots down the ramp at the rear, which folds up to hold it in place when the Reaper is in motion'
p13645
aS" You can see there's a crystal container here as well - another nice small detail which I found the 2007 sets lacked"
p13646
aS" There's also an alien here - thankfully not in those horrendous trans-orange tubes so prevalent last year"
p13647
aS' The complete assembly'
p13648
aS" Isn't it snug? It's just the right size too - not massive but large enough to be a serious mining vehicle"
p13649
aS' The ominous black treads contrast nicely with the white/ orange colour scheme of the vehicle itself'
p13650
aS' The trans detailing - blue for weapons, neon green for energy - is carried nicely through the whole set'
p13651
aS' The blades and the scoops whirl nicely as the machine trundles along'
p13652
aS" Top down view: Tread detail: Whirling blades of death! The buggy descends: Probably the most disturbing aspect of the whole set is this pic: The jelly has an orange pump plugged into its heart which is connected to an energy supply on the left hand side! This vehicle runs on alien jelly juice! Either that or it's milking the jelly in some equally disturbing fashion"
p13653
aS" How amoral is that! I know there's been debate about this - the jellys aren't innocent, they're evil energy crystal thieving maniacs etc - but I find it a bit odd that the humans respond by chaining the jelly up to the bowels of their mining vehcile and suck energy from its heart"
p13654
aS" People debate about violence in Lego as represented by realistic minifig weapons, but I think the moral lesson here is even worse - it's OK to exploit foreign life forms for our own gain if they treat us badly first! (Who-fans, I think the Ood should have a word with the jelly Commander ) That aside, this set is well-designed and fairly good value at $AUD79"
p13655
aS'95'
p13656
aS" It's definitely a notch above last year's Mars Mission sets overall, with improved detailing and more useful functions"
p13657
aS" The holo-stickers are fab and it's nice to have an alien commander, even if he is a bit bulky and his fingers are identical to his toes"
p13658
aS" However, if all these reasons by themselves weren't reason to recomend this set, the following is"
p13659
aS' Part 4: Power Functions The best part of this set - and the reason I bought it, really - is the integration of Power Functions'
p13660
aS" Bizarrely this isn't mentioned at all on the box and I only found out about it from the instructions when they were posted on Eurobricks! (Instructions for book 2 which has the Power function stuff available here"
p13661
aS') This is a great idea and hopefully we will see more new sets take this kind of approach (especially with the new Train sets)'
p13662
aS' Luckily I got Monster Dino 4958 on sale for half price earlier this year so already had most of the necessary motors etc - the only one needed was an extra small one'
p13663
aS' What you need is listed in the instructions below with redirections to Shop @ Home to buy the motors'
p13664
aS" Note there's actually a mistake on this page"
p13665
aS' The 2 small motors you need are both 8883 not 8882 (which is the large XL motor)'
p13666
aS' Way to confuse the kids there, Lego! Attaching them was a dream and only took a few minutes (In contrast to 4958 where it was almost impossible to remove motor elements without dismantling the model)'
p13667
aS' Basically the back platform and some plates and orange slopes come off, you attach the motors, and then the smaller plates go back on'
p13668
aS" These parts are now left loose: Overall the look of the Reaper isn't badly effected as you're mainly viewing from the front anyway: Sadly I can't show you how it moves, you'll just have to trust me that it does ! The way it is steered is demonsrated in the instruction pages above"
p13669
aS' Basically each motor is controlled by a corresponding switch on the remote'
p13670
aS' Move them both forward to move forward, move one right to turn right, move both back to move back etc'
p13671
aS" It zips along! It's a speedy little thing! Personally I wouldn't want to be in it's path as it comes roaring down the Martian canyon! (My cat was scared as it was"
p13672
aS") It is oodles of fun and definitely worth trying if you have the motors or can get them cheaply, and adds a whole new dimension to the 'play' aspect of 'playset'"
p13673
aS' It is also as I said very quick to switch between modded and non-modded Reaper in contrast to the more fiddly Dino creations'
p13674
aS' The only problem I had is that if it moves too fast, the weight of the battery box at the back tends to pull the whole thing back and it rears up'
p13675
aS' It does correct itself though'
p13676
aS' I only trialled this on carpet last night so it may behave differently on other surfaces - I will need to experiment! Part 5: Summation This is a great set made even better with the addition of Power Functions'
p13677
aS' At $AUD79'
p13678
aS"95 it's well-priced"
p13679
aS" Buy it! Buy the motors as well (K-Mart still has stock of 4958 at $89, wait for a 15% off sale)! You won't regret it"
p13680
aS' Buy 2 and make competing battle machines! The only thing is'
p13681
aS" just don't torture that poor jelly Edited by Sinner, 24 June 2008 - 03:25 AM"
p13682
aS'Wonder full job, but now my wallet aches in misery'
p13683
aS'Im not that into Mars Mission'
p13684
aS' but this set reminds me of the Jungle Cutter'
p13685
aS'Great review'
p13686
aS' I just got 7644 MX-81 Hypersonic Operations Aircraft'
p13687
aS" It's a great ship"
p13688
aS' I started to review it, but then it started to rain (I was outside), so the review is coming tommorow'
p13689
aS' Technicolor stickers! Very pretty!'
p13690
aS"You really are an awesome set reviewer, svelte_corps!! Thanks very much for this sweet review, so in-depth and detailed, that is one sweet vehicle! It's got three of my favourite things, treads, orange, and big slicey blades! Thanks again! ~Peace"
p13691
aS'Another great review'
p13692
aS" I'm looking forward to getting this set sometime soon"
p13693
aS" I wasn't aware of the power function aspect, similar I suppose to the old technic sets which had an additional instructions for those with the relevant motors"
p13694
aS" I knew those dino's I got at clearance would come in useful"
p13695
aS' Nice to see the recent "bulldozer" treads appearing in black'
p13696
aS' Grey seemed a slightly unusual colour choice'
p13697
aS'These new sets are just totally off-the-wall radical :D'
p13698
aS" It's the little details like the scoops on the blades and the alternate alien energy source (Lego didn't even have to include those, but they did!) that show Lego are really getting back into their groove this year"
p13699
aS" The ability to add power functions is just so cool as well, I'm going to pick-up the Creator Monster Dino set for the electronics when the sales hit as svelte has suggested"
p13700
aS' A very entertaining review, just like the Agents mobile command center one :D'
p13701
aS"This set looks 10 times sweeter with the power functions, too bad I'll have to buy some extra"
p13702
aS'nice review the power functions is a nice idea and i ownder if it will appear in any other new sets? regarless if i get this (i decided to just to get what ever looks good in the shops from now on ) im defianltey picking up some of the white visors off bricklink'
p13703
aS'Wow, this thing is very cool'
p13704
aS' Definately no lack of details, and is quite cheap for the bang of the set that you get'
p13705
aS' For some reason I really love the bay in the back of the detachable ship'
p13706
aS' Quite an improvement from last years line'
p13707
aS' Thank you for the review'
p13708
aS"I was going to buy this set anyway, but now I'm even more excited"
p13709
aS' :D My favorite part of this set is the bay that holds the little cart vehicles'
p13710
aS'Thank you for that fine review, svelte_corps'
p13711
aS' Thats a pretty cool set, much more solid than the Armoured Drilling Unit, with a nice little transporter and some for sure pretty interesting additional power functions'
p13712
aS' A very smart idea indeed! Did I miss something or is there really only one (and probably improved) shooting device? And therere even some levers to control the vehicles'
p13713
aS' wow'
p13714
aS' A matured MarsMission on indeed! Now lets get rid of these poor utilized jellies and were right on the way'
p13715
aS"Isn't it a lovely set? I too have one"
p13716
aS' (modded, of course )'
p13717
aS"Asuka, on Jun 4 2008, 09:26 AM, said: Did I miss something or is there really only one (and probably improved) shooting device? No, you didn't miss anything"
p13718
aS" There's only one, and it's the less obtrusive new piece The range is pretty poor, though "
p13719
aS"So, is there some way to get all those motor bits at once, or do you have to buy them on their own? I don't think I've ever seen them in a store here"
p13720
aS"Iron Moose, on Jun 4 2008, 11:28 AM, said: So, is there some way to get all those motor bits at once, or do you have to buy them on their own? I don't think I've ever seen them in a store here"
p13721
aS' Only from S@H so far, or if you buy sets which they come in'
p13722
aS' All the ones you need (apart from one additional small motor) are available in the 4958 Monster Dino set (which I got half price)'
p13723
aS' I ordered the extra from S@H at the same time I bought the set - but only because I had already looked at the instructions and knew what I needed'
p13724
aS' (If people have the Ferris Wheel set as well I think the small motor comes in that'
p13725
aS'This should be reported to the news '
p13726
aS"Well I guess its nice that they're making the story background a little more clear"
p13727
aS' With that jelly plugged into the power cable'
p13728
aS' Hmmh, both Jellies and crystals can be used as power sources, think theres a connection? both of them are transparent and greenish'
p13729
aS' Maybe Jellies hatch from crystals like eggs? or need them as food? or something important like that? Yay for evil humans'
p13730
aS'Thanks for the great review Sveltecorps'
p13731
aS' I bought some of the MM last year and ended up selling them off for SW'
p13732
aS' This new set has got me interested in MM again, partly due to your cool review! One question though, Did you get this set in Aust shops or S@H, just wondering if i should be looking for it yet? EDIT: sorry just saw your other post saying it was ordered from S@H Cheers ISC Edited by I Scream Clone, 04 June 2008 - 08:08 AM'

p13736
aS' Set'
p13737
aS" I mean, come on, it's a flipping tank! Awesomeness is written all over this - from all those blades and scoops at the front to the mini rover"
p13738
aS' And yes, you can even turn it into a motorized battle tank! Reminds me of the old technic days when they advertised in the manuals how to hook up the kits with separately sold motors'
p13739
aS' Another day, another review of an awesome set'
p13740
aS" Yes, this is sure TLC's year!"

aS' just don\'t torture that poor jelly I smell another "Dont hurt the dragons/jellies" or something group Nice Reveiw i dont realy like the MM sets [We WANT MORE STARJUSTICE/SPACE SKULLS!!!!!!] But this one looks Ok i guess suprised they dont say that it has power functions on the box'
p13743
aS"Really Nice review! I love those sweet looking power functions on it, if only the orange bits could be replaced, then you could have a futuristic and motorized Jungle Cutter Anyway, the alien bit was disturbing, but the overly-tall new commanders look very, very cool! All in all, a great set, but I won't be able to buy it, because, in a few days, S@H will become 600$ richer and my wallet will writhe around in pain on the floor"
p13744
aS"Algernon, on Jun 5 2008, 02:03 PM, said: Why is it that Agents and Star Wars get their own news articles but this fantastic set is totally ignored? I think maybe there's a bit of Star Wars excitement on the front page which has probably got a few members frothing with excitement"
p13745
aS' Not every review needs to be frontpaged anyway '
p13746
aS'No, but this IS one of the most anticipated sets of 08'
p13747
aS'Well, title says it'
p13748
aS" The description, you'll understand later"
p13749
aS" I ordered this off of S@H last tuesday, and oddly enough, it's listed on S@H as MX-81 Hypersonic Airplane"
p13750
aS" I'd like to apologize for the random, horrible, faded pics"
p13751
aS' I took the review outside, and the clouds kept shifting, changing the lighting, and then I had to go inside because it started raining'
p13752
aS" It's been raining for a week"
p13753
aS" It's raining now, as I type this"
p13754
aS' So, I foolishly went outside to take pics'
p13755
aS' The front of the box'
p13756
aS' Not bad, as far as boxes go'
p13757
aS' It features a lift-up tab'
p13758
aS'which shows the various functions'
p13759
aS' Back of the box'
p13760
aS' Still not much to say'
p13761
aS' Two manuals'
p13762
aS' I think this is just right- Not too thick, but not too many manuals, either'
p13763
aS' Oddly enough, the box came with a little folded up piece of paper telling us not to mix the bags'
p13764
aS' It comes sorted into 4 bags, by the way'
p13765
aS' Minifigures The set features 3 normal MM figs, 1 normal jellie, and one of the new commanders'
p13766
aS' I really like this guy'
p13767
aS' He has a few issues, like his hands being stuck sideways, and still being hollow, but still a great improvement'
p13768
aS" He'll make a lovely addition to any Halloween MOC"
p13769
aS' Stickers The set comes with a fairly big DSS for the Spacecraft'
p13770
aS' Pretty normal, but I do like the dragon sticker'
p13771
aS' Then, suprises of suprises, a technicolor sticker sheet for the aliens! How cool is this, huh? The tops of the actual stickers are shiny, which is hard to see in the pic'
p13772
aS" Even the bottom is shiny! Who said stickers can't be cool? The mining craft The little guy is pretty cute, and well built"
p13773
aS" My only gripe is that there's nowhere to spin the drill! It seems so lifeless without a feature"
p13774
aS" The alien craft You'd think a Commander would be important enough to have a seatbelt, rather than be stabbed with a clip and stuck on the ship like those other grunt aliens"
p13775
aS' I think this thing has some potential'
p13776
aS' Shiny stickers, different body shape'
p13777
aS' And when you look at those engines, this thing could be an alien Corvette! But then you look at the back'
p13778
aS' Pretty bare, no flares or anything'
p13779
aS" It's a cool little craft, but it just"
p13780
aS'lacks'
p13781
aS' The modules These things have some potential, as well'
p13782
aS' With some modding, they could be pretty cool'
p13783
aS" Unfortunetly, it's pretty boxy, there are no engines, and the wings are too small"
p13784
aS' The top is pretty nice, though'
p13785
aS' The greebles are all right'
p13786
aS' The controls, as usual, are a sticker'
p13787
aS' Pretty spacious, mind you'
p13788
aS" The cockpit doesn't stay flush with the body, though"
p13789
aS' The front plate underneath it can be easily replaced with a brick to fix that'
p13790
aS"I'm not gonna comment on this"
p13791
aS' The main body Too bad'
p13792
aS" The 'labratory' isn't much of a lab"
p13793
aS" A trans-red panel and some tray thing are all that compose the 'lab'"
p13794
aS' I was expecting more, but true to form, this Mars Mission set has no impressive interior to speak of'
p13795
aS" There is a lot of space, though, so it shouldn't be hard to mod"
p13796
aS' Phew! The lab folds up like so'
p13797
aS' Pretty simple, and would allow access to the lab, if there was one'
p13798
aS' And then we have this thing'
p13799
aS' What is it? Defense laser? Communications array? Satellite T'
p13800
aS'V'
p13801
aS'? The modules connect like so (sorry, out of place'
p13802
aS'): Too bad the pins stick out'
p13803
aS' Various pics'
p13804
aS' As you can see, this thing has more of those bars than an AT&T commercial'
p13805
aS' (There, you understand the topic description now? ) The rear'
p13806
aS' It uses a white City plane wing for the'
p13807
aS'wings'
p13808
aS' When I first saw the prototype pics, I thought they slanted downwards'
p13809
aS" That would've been really cool"
p13810
aS' Ah, now to the platform'
p13811
aS' From the position of the drill, I think this could be a really cool turret location when I MOD it to more military space'
p13812
aS' Back to the bars'
p13813
aS" If we had space monkeys, they'd love this"
p13814
aS' This set has more bars than a jungle gym'
p13815
aS'( ) Here we see the button that drops the platform'
p13816
aS" Pretty clever, and it's not in the way"
p13817
aS' Best of all, it really works! Really well, actually'
p13818
aS' Good job, TLC'
p13819
aS' 2 more bars and a shooter mechanism'
p13820
aS' Jeeze, this is really setting itself up for a joke'
p13821
aS' A shooter mechanism walks into a bar'
p13822
aS' Never mind! Here we have the handle that allows you to pick it up safely'
p13823
aS" A good idea, but it's placed waaaay to far back, way off the center of balance"
p13824
aS' You have to hold on to it pretty well to keep it angled up, though it does stop your hands from getting in the way of the platform'
p13825
aS' Ah! The platform in action'
p13826
aS' This is really a neat little feature'
p13827
aS' Not only can the ship land in a reduced footprint, but it also prevents the nice white paint job from getting red dust all over it'
p13828
aS" It's centered pretty well, too, and you don't have to worry about knocking it over, just don't shove it back at all"
p13829
aS' Here we have the latch'
p13830
aS' When the button on top is pushed, this gets pulled inward'
p13831
aS'Which pulls out of this hole and allows it to swing neatly down'
p13832
aS' Good luck, and happy mining!! Again, sorry for the lack of in-progress review'
p13833
aS" I would've liked to take pics of the mechanism and so on, but typical of the MM sets, you can't really take it apart"
p13834
aS' Well, this is really a nice set, which can hopefully be upgraded with a better lab with little difficulty'
p13835
aS' Some of my military mod plans include: -Strip the lab and install a command center -get rid of lots of bars'
p13836
aS' The thing has more bars than Alcatraz'
p13837
aS' -Install some turrets'
p13838
aS" This is a big command ship, so why all the forward-facing weapons? It'll need some AA defense"
p13839
aS' -mod the landing platform to be a troop dropper with installable AA turret'
p13840
aS' -mod the cockpit pods to be more aerodymic'
p13841
aS" So, that's all folks"
p13842
aS' Shall I include one last "bar" joke?'
p13843
aS'I appreciate your review Mr'
p13844
aS' Mandalorian, but why the negativity?'
p13845
aS" I'd try to find more positives about the set instead of kinda criticizing it after each picture"
p13846
aS" I personally think it looks freakin' awesome!"
p13847
aS' The size is very impresive and I nearly fell of my chair when I saw the first pics earlier this year'
p13848
aS" It's quite unlike anything I've ever seen from Lego"

aS'Thanks for the review'
p13851
aS' I really like all the Mars Mission sets this year'
p13852
aS" The usage of the big wing is a bit annoying, but you can't blame LEGO for re-using the mold"
p13853
aS" I've been considering doing the same with mine! Mr"

p13855
aS' Shall I include one last "bar" joke? I wouldn\'t have a bar of it'
p13856
aS'Thanks for the review, Mr'
p13857
aS' Mandalorian! This is an, er, interesting set'
p13858
aS' Lots of frontal fire-power'
p13859
aS' Very big too, and I like the idea of those two little craft that attach on the sides'
p13860
aS' Sort of like little escape pod things'
p13861
aS' Anywho, not one of the things on my to buy list, but I do like that radio-active sticker, that could come in use'
p13862
aS' Looking forward to seeing your modifications, too! ~Peace'
p13863
aS'Thanks for the great and very detailed review'
p13864
aS" I love the new holostickers! I'm still not sold on this set though"
p13865
aS" I'm not sure why"
p13866
aS" I think it's the big wing piece and the too-technicy build (from looking at the instructions)"
p13867
aS' The platform seems kind of out of place'
p13868
aS" And for the size of the set, the functionality doesn't seem as good as it could be"
p13869
aS" It reminds me of 7699 Armored Drilling Unit - looks impressive but doesn't seem to do that much"
p13870
aS' I do think Mars Mission has improved this year though'
p13871
aS' Bar none, this is the weakest of the new MM sets I think'

p13875
ag13801
aS'? That certainly feels like an homage to the Deep Freeze Defender'
p13876
aS' which itself feels like an homage to the Galaxy Commander'
p13877
aS' Is there some way to centre one of the cockpit units without massive de- and re- construction?'
p13878
aS'Thanks for the review Mr'
p13879
aS' Mandalorian'
p13880
aS' The Alien craft is a bit small in my opinion could have done with being just a little bit larger'
p13881
aS' The main craft however despite its few minor flaws looks very good'
p13882
aS' While space isnt my normal theme Im certainly being tempted this year'

aS' which itself feels like an homage to the Galaxy Commander'
p13885
aS' Thats the observation I had when I saw the first pictures of this set online a few months ago'
p13886
aS" I am a proud owner of the 6973 Deep Freeze Defender and 6980 Galaxy Commander, so I'm looking forward to see how the 7644 stacks up next to them"
p13887
aS' There is a definite lineage here, and these sets clearly demonstrate the evolution of Lego set design over the years'
p13888
aS' The MX-81 may not have the most playability out of all the new MM sets (although it has ALOT from what I can tell), but its hard to beat the look of a large sleek space cruiser sitting on your shelf or dresser, at least for myself'
p13889
aS" Anyhow, this is my first post to the forum and hope my welcome won't wear out here anytime soon"

p13892
aS' Having a name like that is a good start!'
p13893
aS'Thanks for the review'
p13894
aS' I have to concede this does appear to be the weakest set of the summer MM lineup'
p13895
aS" I've noticed a trend that the larger sets have plenty of parts potential but when assembled the model is not more than the sum of the parts"
p13896
aS" Eagle Base certainly didn't seem worth the asking price, at least this is one large model"
p13897
aS' On a positive note the lame aero tubes, darts and martian carrier pods have disappeared'
p13898
aS" Don't get me wrong, I love MM and most of the lineup is great, this one just seems to fall a little short of the BAR"
p13899
aS"I don't understand why there's so much negativity"
p13900
aS' this is actually my favorite of the new MM sets'
p13901
aS' The finished look is very sleek and not very gappy at all'
p13902
aS" The deployable landing pad is great, and it'll make it easy to put on a shelf without taking too much room"
p13903
aS' Lots of greebles'
p13904
aS" although I will concede that it's just begging to be modded"
p13905
aS" Still, though, I'm definitely buying this one"
p13906

p13908
aS' Thanks for the warm welcome'
p13909
aS'Two more questions: 1 - how stable is the entire craft when balanced on the platform? Is there a chance that it will just collapse? 2 - what are the total wingspan, height and depth measurements of the model?'

p13918
aS" That said, having grown up with Lego during the 80's this set has a certain nostalgia factor in its overall look and feel that harkens back to that earlier period in my life which I fondly remember"
p13919
aS" Aside from the Factory Star Justice set (elements of which I loathe), I expect the 7644 to be the closest thing to a Classic Space revival that we'll ever see again from the Lego Group, but I hope to be pleasantly suprised someday"
p13920
aS" Though I'm not living in the past, and do appreciate everything Lego is doing now and will do, and has done since"
p13921
aS" And, like you, I'm one who's definitely buying this set"

aS'Great review, Mr'
p13927
aS' Boba Fett'
p13928
aS' I really like this set a lot'
p13929
aS' Some of the features may not be as good as I hoped they would, but overall this looks to be a really nice set'
p13930
aS" I'm so happy that the giant spacecrafts are finally back"

aS' On a positive note the lame aero tubes, darts and martian carrier pods have disappeared'
p13934
aS" Hm, actually, I don't see the comparison"
p13935
aS' Eagle base looked terible to me right from the start, so it was no suprise when it ended up being the weakest kit in the first year'
p13936
aS' This big ship, on the other hand, looked great as soon as I saw it, and still looks good'
p13937

p13938
aS" (I'm being curious, not confrontational"
p13939
aS" ) Well, first and foremost like many other people I'm no fan of those dreaded unprinted minifig torsos and stickers"
p13940
aS' But also the cost to piece ratio of the set, it just seems too expensive for everything that you get, such as too many small parts and a lighter than usual piece count for the price'
p13941
aS' Though if it had included printed minifigs and other elements, I maybe would of been able to swallow its 100 USD cost a little easier'
p13942
aS' But Star Justice is still Lego SPACE in the most classic sense thats available today, and I will probably pony it up just because'
p13943
aS' Anyway, I hope were not breaking Forum protocol by not discussing the 7644 review of the original poster or that particular set in general'
p13944
aS"Wow! i'll definately have to check this one out"
p13945
aS' i always tried making a big mining deployment ship, but it always turned out crappy'

aS' Edited by maiq the liar, 04 June 2008 - 10:52 PM'
p13947
aS'Thanks for the review'
p13948
aS' I actually quite like this'
p13949
aS" I can't afford it, so I'm not getting too attached to it, but in its own way, it's great"
p13950
aS" It's certainly reminiscent of Space sets of the past, as others have said, and the drop-down ramp section is just really cool"
p13951
aS' As an idea, you understand'
p13952
aS' Sure, the lab is a little crap, but at least the effort was made (sort of )'
p13953
aS" The sheer fact that it's so big though, really makes me like this"
p13954
aS" There's just something appealing about large spaceships"
p13955
aS' Not capital ships, just big space ships'
p13956
aS' With lots of guns! Spacefan, on Jun 4 2008, 10:34 PM, said: Anyway, I hope were not breaking Forum protocol by not discussing the 7644 review of the original poster or that particular set in general'
p13957
aS" Hey, it's no worse than Batbrick and I"
p13958
aS" No, really, it isn't even in the same league!"
p13959
aS'Thank you for that nice review, Mr'
p13960
aS' Mandalorian'
p13961
aS' Wow'
p13962
aS' Somehow its almost like Classic Spaces back indeed'
p13963
aS' Its a great star ship'
p13964
aS' It looks stream lined, original and impressive and even the huge plane wing part looks rather cool and smooth on it'
p13965
aS" Its equipped at least with some kind of engines on top of the wings and although theyre made with only two a little 'juniorized' parts its better than nothing"
p13966
aS' Theres a lab or some sort of engine room with enough space inside to allow one or two MFs to play Scotty'
p13967
aS' yeah! The two cockpitsre nicely detailed with a cool use of these orange 1x1 round plates and to detach one or all two of them reminds a lot of the playability of the good old Space sets'
p13968
aS' It seems even like its easy to attach them to some kind of Cloud City Twin-Pod Car thanks these hinged wings'
p13969
aS' Looks like some solid fun to me'
p13970
aS' Of course'
p13971
aS' the cockpits arent airtight and even this reminds unfortunately of the post blue, grey and trans yellow era of CS'
p13972
aS' Anyway, theres no real fun without some MODing I guess'
p13973
aS' Another great advantage of the sets that its not overpacked with shooting things'
p13974
aS' One technic shooter, cool in grey and only one trans orange prison pod too'
p13975
aS' Well, I can surely live with that especially since its nicely asymmetrical'
p13976
aS' The drill rovers very charming, a little like a rebuilt Oldsmobile Convertibe stranded on Mars'
p13977
aS' Sweet! And that platform features plain nifty and well done too, very playable and useable for a lot of things'
p13978
aS' Hmm'
p13979
aS' recently I complained a lot about the dense use of studless technic beams for the inner structure of vehicles like these ExoForce tanks par exemple which makes MODing (in an economical way) pretty frustrating'
p13980
aS' but the beams herere used in a very proper way'
p13981
aS' It should be fairly easy to MOD, lets say, the back of that lab section up to perhaps even the cockpits to create a larger airtight area that could be boarded from the platform'
p13982
aS' just to fit this certain spacers need for, um, realism'
p13983
aS" Therere many more nice details too like that 'satelite t"

ag13075
aS"' thingy and that cylinder with trans blue 2x2 dish for the knob or these cylinders with cones on that handle, and that Alien crafts pretty nice and detailed as well"
p13985
aS' Like I said before'
p13986
aS' I really feel like Classic Spaces back'

aS' Mandalorian, but why the negativity?'

aS" I'd try to find more positives about the set instead of kinda criticizing it after each picture"
p13991
aS" I personally think it looks freakin' awesome!"
p13992
aS' The size is very impresive and I nearly fell of my chair when I saw the first pics earlier this year'

p14008

p14009
aS' However, it does have its own small issues, which are nothing, really'
p14010
aS" I said that there's not much of a lab- but that's the beauty of lego"
p14011
aS" There's a lot of room in the ship, so it should be a piece of cake to mod to a bigger lab"
p14012
aS" Too many bars? I'll take them off"
p14013
aS' I really like the set, I just want to change it to suit my tastes'
p14014
aS' It looks beautiful- It will find a home among my other MM sets as a favorite'
p14015
aS' Iron Moose: Good question'
p14016
aS" It's about 17 inches wide, 11 inches tall (with ramp down), and 16 inches wide"
p14017
aS" As for the platform, it's pretty stable"
p14018
aS" It tilts back a small degree so it doesn't collapse when tapped on the nose, but I wouldn't leave it on the edge of a table while in that position"
p14019
aS'I think this thing is compensating the poor lab with the bar army'
p14020
aS'Nice review'
p14021
aS' Just one little point'
p14022
aS' Since there is no sound transmission through space, but there is an atmosphere on Mars through which this this thing supposedly flies, hypersonic airplane makes far more sense than hypersonic spacecraft ;)'
p14023
aS'Sorry Mr'
p14024
aS' Mandalorian, I guess I was just getting a bit defensive because when this set first appeared here, there were literally 2 pages of people just bagging out the new MM sets (but then the thread took a turn and people started to warm to them, much like the Agents)'
p14025
aS' I do agree that it definitely needs some MOCing, but with that work I think it has the potential to be a really amazing set in terms of what you could cram into it'
p14026
aS" The lab is a little disappointing, I've always wanted an enclosed cabin space in a vehicle this size because then all the little space guys can have a true meeting place! The drop-down landing ramp is my favourite part, it has lots of potential uses"
p14027
aS" Maybe it's even possible to integrate pneumatics :D"

p14031
aS' Today we are reviewing Mars Impulse sets 5616 and 5617'
p14032
aS' Starting with 5617 Alien Jet, I must say it is a small and quick build, the jellie, is made of hard plastic, which surprised me, as I had expected Jellies to be a soft plastic'
p14033
aS' The jet is mainly 2x4 plates, some swingy hinges, the "seatbelt" and a thing which I cannot seem to name My one gripe about it is that the Jelly cant see where he is flying, it looks better with a MF in it'
p14034
aS' There was a red 1x1 as a spare part'
p14035
aS' We move on to the 5616 Mini Robot, which is basically a "safe" brick, with binoculars, soem cheese slopes, little arms, and legs'
p14036

p14065
aS"Hello all Eurobricks members, I will be presenting my first review on one of the Harry Potter's set"
p14066
aS' Firstly, I must emphasize that I am not a very big Harry Potter fan or owned many Harry Potter sets'
p14067
aS' For this review, I will be highlighting what is the beauty of this small little set, and the reasons to own multiple sets of it'
p14068
aS' Comments and critics are strongly welcomed'
p14069
aS' This set is featured in the Harry Potter movie, Prisoner of Azkaban'
p14070
aS" This set is orignally released in 2004, align with the Harry Potter's movie"
p14071
aS' This was actually one of the movie scene where Buckbeak the griffin is appeared in the movie'
p14072
aS' The group of students are supposed to be having up close and personal with him'
p14073
aS' However, Draco decided to disturb our lovely Buckbeak'
p14074
aS' Enough of this movie synopsis, I am sure fans of Harry Potter will know this better'
p14075
aS' Box art Featured mini-fig/creature Background scene The scene is a simple garden, which had a very good mixture of spare parts for your MOCs building'
p14076
aS' On its own, there is nothing outstanding about this set, except for the griffin'
p14077
aS' You can buy multiple sets for the griffin alone and for Draco mini-fig'
p14078
aS" Well, you don't need lots of Draco"
p14079
aS' But for Castle lovers, black cap are exceptionally useful, at least from my view'
p14080
aS' Now, I will point out the following why this sets is so great for other reasons'
p14081
aS' Hidden cover Note that, this is the only mechanism which you can find in this set'
p14082
aS' It looks rather simple but quite useful'
p14083
aS' There are some little things hide in it too'
p14084
aS' Greens, Foilage and Brown parts Needless to say much, it offer 3 foilage, a green plant, 3 brown slopes, 2 ideal bricks and 1x1 brown brick for building a tree'
p14085
aS' Great for jungle building, forest building and etc'
p14086
aS' I am sure there are many builders will look out for these'
p14087
aS' Interesting parts It comes with a wizard book, owl, 2 printed tiles with a spider and stone prints on it'
p14088
aS" The far right, seriously I don't find any good use for it"
p14089
aS' Can any EB members enlighten me on that gray thing on the right? Grey parts It comes with a good 10 x 4 green plate'
p14090
aS' Useful for adding as a platform'
p14091
aS' Some more grey slopes for your MOCs'
p14092
aS' There you have it, Draco encounter with Buckbeak comparing with Deep Forest Ambush As you may remembered recently, there was an impulse set competition'
p14093
aS' One of my entries, which is under the History theme'
p14094
aS' The Deep Forest Ambush was firstly inspired by this set, and made an improvement out of it'
p14095
aS' Look at the improved tree compared with the orignal'
p14096
aS' Summary review Playability: 4/10 (Not much to play with, except swooshing around the Griffin) Design: 5/10 (Too simple and its defintely not related with the movie scene) Parts: 10/10 (Great for parts, explained by the review'
p14097
aS' A great deal of green and brown parts) Price: 9/10 (An inexpensive set based on the 2004 pricing) Overall: 7/10 (A must have for all Harry Potter fans and collectors whom needs a great use of green and brown parts) Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine'

p14105
aS" The far right, seriously I don't find any good use for it"
p14106
aS" Can any EB members enlighten me on that gray thing on the right? The gray thing is technically a plume, like any castle plume, except in this case it's a feather (presumably from the griffin), and made from the mold to the old Indian feathers in the Wild West sets"
p14107
aS" It's a case of an old part coming back for a slightly new use, in a new colour"
p14108
aS' Beyond that, the "stone print" tile is a bundle or rolled up blanket or package, depending on where it\'s used'
p14109
aS" I don't think it's ever meant to be a stone"

aS' It was used as a rolled up pack on the back of the Star Wars speederbikes, for example'

p14123
aS'Thanks for the nice review - it was one of the first ones I got when emerging from my dark ages '
p14124
aS' I bought two of these, just for Buckbeack - I thought he would make a good statue in a Persian temple type MOC'
p14125
aS' I also liked the minifig head pumpkin and plant part in bright green - both new pieces to me at the time'
p14126
aS' All in all, it was a good castle or forest building set with a nice selection of pieces for rocks, grass, plants and trees'
p14127
aS' The dark bley plume piece also now appears in the 10185 Green Grocer set as detailing on the roof of the turret'
p14128
aS'Guys, thanks for your kind comments! I am glad that you have enjoyed this review'
p14129
aS' For this set, I think I bought about 7 to 8 sets, all for the griffins'
p14130
aS" It's used for my griffin riders in my Castle collection"
p14131
aS' Now, the green and brown parts come in very handy for Castle MOCs too'

p14164
aS' nice set for plants, huh? too bad i didnt get thus set'
p14165
aS' but luckily my neighbor did! that griffin is nice for castle MOCs, and that orange head (pumpkin, i know) seems rare to me'
p14166
aS' not much else to say'

Good work No printed face on the pumpkin since the event didn't happen on or near Halloween, unlike the whole troll situation I also agree that this Draco is the best one, the new one looks too much like a Draco from the oldr films, when he smirked a lot more, but, since very character got a redesign"

aS' I have overlooked it earlier'
p14196
aS' I strongly agreed with you, that this Draco is the best TLC made'
p14197
aS' I pretty like the face compared to others'
p14198
aS' Furthermore, I used my multiple Dracos, for my castle armor guards instead'
p14199
aS' One could not have too many Dracos'
p14200
aS' Buckbeak design is well made'
p14201
aS' The head can be moved upwards and downwards'
p14202
aS' The mechanism is similar to the horse design'
p14203
aS' In addition, Buckbeak wings can be removed'
p14204
aS' Similar to the typical green or black dragon wings that we used to see in the past'
p14205
aS' Well, the main reason for me to buy this set was in fact Buckbeak'

aS' Sorry to said, there is no print on that pumpkin face'
p14209
aS" It's pure orange"
p14210
aS'I bought about 5 or 6 of these sets when they were on sale in mid- 2006'
p14211
aS' I still have a few of them laying around unopened'
p14212
aS' I think I payed like under $5 for each and thats a great deal for all the variety of neat parts you get with this set'
p14213
aS'nice review'
p14214
aS' I like the treemaking pieces the most of this not very expensive set'
p14215
aS' The Buckbeak fig is very nice and can bow his head like the horses'
p14216
aS' I was annoyed to get another Draco without some other not made figs (Pansy Parkinson for example)'
p14217
aS' About the dark bley feathers; In the second version of Hogwarts there were several of these feathers put in little 1x1 cones like it was a feather to write with it'
p14218
aS' I bought 2 sets of these and when they were for sale I just bought +/- 6 more of it'
p14219
aS" Only annoying that I had then even a bigger army of Draco's"
p14220
aS'I see a lot of good reviews on this site, but this one is superb! Good job'
p14221
aS' Tom'
p14222
aS"I'm looking forward to getting this set, as well"
p14223
aS' The Hippogriff will become the valiant steed to my princess minifig for her comic adventures'
p14224
aS' I\'m really annoyed that the Harry Potter sets were released during my "dark age"'
p14225
aS" I so would've wanted all of them"
p14226
aS'Yay! The Monster Book of Monsters! Now I want this! I also love the Buckbeak figure! It looks very realistic for a LEGO version of something, usually they are much worse (Look at the goblins, for example)'
p14227
aS'Very cool review !'
p14228
aS"Hello EB! Yes, I'm cranking out the reviews! The other day I picked up this gem for an okay sales price at Devonport, Tas, while searching for the new Batsets"
p14229
aS" I informed iamded of this as he is a Spidey-suckup ( ) and he informed me this was the only set he didn't have of the Wave 2 of this theme"
p14230
aS" So I ask you great EB members to please remind him of this when commenting! Here we go with the review of Doctopus' lair: Anyway, unlike other reviews, this stars more people, the Batbrick-iamded-dragonator-Daisy review! (Daisy is the mouse that came in the set) First up re the figs, and I must say they are great"
p14231
aS' I love fleshies and these are excellent to expand my Batman world, plus having a Spiderman to beat up is good too Doctopus is great, though his tentacles are annoying to keep in order'
p14232
aS' Peter Parker is a nice addition, I love that torso'
p14233
aS' Eve though Harry Osborn was totally absent from this scene, I welcome him as he is a good fig also'
p14234
aS" Best of all is Mary Jane, fleshie females are hard to come by and I love that hair, my very first one! Oh, and even better is bley Daisy on the far right: Another fantastic thing is that by mixing MJ with Doctopus you get a far more deadly and real villain than anyone could've forseen - The Hippy! Oh c'mon, tell me that ain't cool? Anyhoo, here is a pic of Doctopus showing his might: Random fact: Did you know I influence both dragonator and iamded in their sigfigs? dragonator adapts his from my IA series while iamded added Mutt hair when I had him like that in a pic I posted"
p14235
aS' Now onto the box, sorry about the lighting'
p14236
aS' The art is good and the cartoon spidey in the corner may have beenthe inspiration for a similar style in the new Batsets: Back of the box'
p14237
aS' Again, sorry about the lighting and blur, it was gtting late and these were the last pics: Finally we get to the first part of the set: The catapult'
p14238
aS" Is that movie accurate or what? I love the part in SM2 when he uses his homemade genetic spider powered catapult to launch himself to the scene! Oh well, it does comes with a cool spider web an trans blue spider, so it gets some points: And it is really fun! I launched spidey several metres once, I don't think he ever recovered"
p14239
aS' Infact, he almost certainly webbed himself Slightly cooler extras are these two'
p14240
aS' This awesome little boat is great for city, as is the simple but nice bouy, Daisy approves: Naturally dragonator ruins everything when he found out the "dragon" that would be riding with him was our nickname for Daisy Now finally, the main attraction - Coctopus\' Dock'
p14241
aS' iamded and I threw dragonator in the water to see if he could swim'
p14242
aS" He er, couldn't One Sweeney todd later, we continue! The overall construction of the building is very good"
p14243
aS' I know a lot of people hated stickers and i hated applying these, but they do look spectacular and perfect for any City setting, like a bank, a Gotham Bank As iamded has already noted below me the black lifesavers a very cool as are the web piece and log pieces: The inside contains the neutron copperplate triple bypass humdrum holy hum 5000, which does does, see movie'
p14244
aS' Anyhoo, it is very cool, and includes a little control thingy on the yellow brick next to it'
p14245
aS' Unfortunately, the inside is plain but for that: The other side has no wall too which is a bit of a letdown really, but atleast it allows Daisy easy access'
p14246
aS' one gripe is those yellow 1x1 bricks, they serve no purpose and break up the colour scheme: Better shot of the thingy thing'
p14247
aS' I quite like it, the use of technic parts actually works, and the whole set is worth it for those purple flames and dishes alone It closes up pretty well too, unable to hit the dish which is a nice feature: Me and iamded liked it so much we threw a revived dragonator into it'
p14248
aS' Unfortunately it disagreed with him, but it was fun: Another shot of the dock'
p14249
aS" I like how they have gaps in the jetty, I know the movie version was pretty wack, and although the set isn't very faithful to it (looks more like a seaside library to be frank) it still is very nice"
p14250
aS' This is my first large blue baseplate too which is wonderful, though funny how the set only uses about half of it: The roof is a well designed and fun feature, it uses some technic connections to render it flexible of any degree, as you can see here by my opening of it: Better shot of the roof design, it can lie flat or at any angle'
p14251
aS' I might use the design myself in the future: As much as I love the building this feature bugs me, for in order for it to work this wall has to stick out, which not only looks ugly but makes you be able to see through the corners'
p14252
aS' Still, easily modded, and log pieces are fantastic for mocing'
p14253
aS' It also means that there are 7 windows all up for a good, sizeable building: By pulling out the piece in the center the walls both collapss sideways outwards, which is actually pretty fun and works everytime: Overall view of the set including characters: Now for the story that makes no sense'
p14254
aS"at all: Spiderman is dead after falling down the wall mechanism (see above): Only Daisy can save the day! For dragonator is being held by the evil Doctopus! And iamded and dragonator are too busy not caring! And Brainbox is too busy complaining that this goes against all Marvel continuity! Unfortunately Daisy is on a lunchbreak so tough luck dragonator: And Daisy goes on a search for fortune and glory: Okay, this is what I think of the set: Build: 3/5 - Fun, but those stickers ruin the experience somewhat, and if you don't apply them the instructions are a bit hard to follow"
p14255
aS' Playability: 4/5 - Great little gizmos and bits, not the kind that keep you going like with the 2007 Aquabase, but good fun still'
p14256
aS' Design: 4/5 - Not very movie faithful no, but still a great little building and a smart design for certain aspects'
p14257
aS' Minifigs: 5/5 - Great figs with all different faces and very useful bits'
p14258
aS" Price: 2/5 Far, FAR overpriced even on sale sadly Total: 18/25 - A good set that could've been better with a few minor changes"
p14259
aS" Nothing wrong with it, but it doesn't really cross the line to greatness"
p14260
aS' That said, it has a lot going for it and definitely worth buying or atleast a look! Thanks for reading Batbrick Away! Edited by Batbrick, 13 June 2008 - 12:21 PM'
p14261
aS"Lookin' good so far! Though I must say it's Doc Ock, not Dok Ock"
p14262
aS' The catapult is, well, ridiculous, but the boat is very spiffy, and the buoy is a nice addition! I actually like the stickers on the window pieces, perfect for this building, and great for post-Apoc scenes'
p14263
aS' Black life-saver rings are a nice addition too'

p14327
aS' Or position the wings in flight mode to survey the area for intruders! Either way, the V-wing is ready to strike for the Republic'
p14328
aS' Includes Clone pilot and R4 droid'
p14329
aS' Position wings in attack or flight mode! Sorry to all for the delay, since this was supposed to be done 3 days ago'
p14330
aS' Anyway, to get on with it'
p14331
aS' Quite a minimal amount of baggies for this set, as noticed'
p14332
aS' And the best thing is'
p14333
aS' no sticker sheet'
p14334
aS' Yippee!! :bounce: The completed v-wing'
p14335
aS' Though not really a complaint, it would be nice if the entire astromech body was provided instead of only the head dome'
p14336
aS" :p Of course, then it wouldn't be movie-accurate, since the Q7 series astro-mech is integrated with the starfighter"
p14337
aS" :lol: He's definitely well-painted for a simple mini-fig"
p14338
aS' Since even the back is painted too'
p14339
aS" I have to assumed this is the same mini-fig provided for 7259 ARC-170 Starfighter too, since I don't have that set"
p14340
aS" Anyway, this mini-fig is much more accurate for this v-wing since his suit is rated against vacuum, while those in the arc-170 aren't "
p14341
aS" :p One thing that's lacking is the instruments panel in the cockpit"
p14342
aS" it's totally non-existent here"
p14343
aS' I wonder what went wrong during the design stage'
p14344
aS' Personally'
p14345
aS' this is the second most anticipated set for 2006, the first being the tie interceptor, for me'
p14346
aS" One thing is that there's no known release of the V-wing starfighter by hasbro, nor the other well-known brands"
p14347
aS' The other thing is that being a star wars vehicle collector, I would really loved to see a replica toy of the V-wing'
p14348
aS' And the V-wing by the Lego Group does not disappoint'
p14349
aS" it's nearly movie-accurate, except for the cockpit transparisteel cover which could used some paint like the x-wing's"
p14350
aS" Also, there's a permanent landing gear that quite neat, since it allows you to land the craft on uniform surfaces"
p14351
aS' The s-foils on the other hand can be quite a pain to pose into flight position'
p14352
aS' Very difficult for the s-foils to remain symmetrical during play'
p14353
aS' The "swoosh-able" or play factor of this product is quite good'
p14354
aS' just check out the pics for yourself'
p14355
aS' :D *Crackle* General Skywalker, we have incoming! To conclude, the v-wing starfighter would make a much better companion to the Eta-2 Actis Interceptor (Jedi Starfighter), than the arc-170'
p14356
aS' Coz the arc-170 seems more like a long-range bomber to me, than a snub-fighter'
p14357
aS' :p And a final pic to show it at rest'
p14358
aS' Comments (For 2008) Just an updated pic to show my latest display on the clone wars Hmm'
p14359
aS' off the record, I do understand that sometimes, reviews by most tend to a certain set of guidelines like naming the set, and showing the boxed, and out of boxed pics, and of course, the grading portion'
p14360
aS' Regarding my review, I prefer not to grade any of the lego sets at all as far as possible, because to each, his/her own'
p14361
aS' My reasons to put up a review is not to belittle the efforts of TLG in coming out with these products nor to help them market them, but to show my appreciation and enjoyment of these products'
p14362
aS' I hope noone is offended by this, and would like to apologise for any misunderstanding that this may caused'

p14364
aS'Thanks for the detailed review valentin it had good picture quality and a nice little comic near the end'
p14365
aS' Although this is a slightly older set it still was a good one, I remmeber that I bought two of them to build up a small airforce for the Republic, and if I see another one I may buy it for use in the Starwars Comic game'
p14366
aS' Keep up the good work '
p14367
aS'Thanks for another great review'
p14368
aS' I remember getting a few V-Wings cheaper because the boxes had been crushed on their way to the store'

Cockpit opens and instrument panel folds down! It does seem to have more pieces than the average tie fighter, but this is actually cheaper than the 7263 TIE Fighter'

p14408
aS' :sweat: YesH!! Finally'
p14409
aS' A'
p14410
aS' Tie Interceptor!! This is probably the most anticipated for all set for all lego tie collectors worldwide, since the fighter, bomber, advanced, and even the Expanded Universe droid fighter had been released by the Lego Group'
p14411
aS" This set is near movie-accurate, since the bottom part of it ain't"
p14412
aS' :p The cockpit and pylons uses the same design as that of the tie advanced piloted by Darth Vader'
p14413
aS' Except for one minor change, that is the aft interior of the cockpit is strengthen this time'
p14414
aS' And this is indeed good news, since the older models had a problem of hard hinge and loose brick connection'
p14415
aS" There's no landing gear for this set, but it doesn't require it anyway"

p14422
aS' The only flaw for this set is the same flaw for any lego set in SG, the price'

aS' For the next few non-lego pictures, they are the crown of my starfighter collection in 1/18 scale'

p14452
aS' The total parts count is high at 142, but there are no really big pieces among them'
p14453
aS' Inside the box you will find the building instructions, a sheet with some odd sticky labels (thrown away) and 3 polybags marked by the bag building difficulty'
p14454
aS" The models The lime colored car doesn't bring out anything new"
p14455
aS' We have seen racers built like that before, but it does contain some nice bricks for the collection'
p14456
aS' The police cruiser surprises with an interesting design along the sides as seen here'
p14457
aS' It is harder to build because of the greater level of details: The helicopter is without doubt the hardest vehicle to build in a bag'
p14458
aS" I can't finish it because it's larger than the bag"
p14459
aS" You can't put on the top blades nor the tail of the thing, so it beats the forklift from 7733 where the top bar is the new kind that doesn't completely fit"
p14460
aS' There is also instructions for the alternate models, but it requires the bags to be opened'
p14461
aS' The vehicles are pretty standard for the racers theme with the police car being the highlight of the set Conclusion I like the difficulty curve between bag 1 and 2, but the last bag should be labeled 1000000 instead of 3'
p14462
aS' It requires some inhuman skills to build that helicopter in the bag'
p14463
aS' ? Lime colored car: 3 - We have seen it before, but it has some nice pieces'

aS' Police Cruiser: 9 - It has a massive diffusers, rare parts and a high level of details'
p14466
aS' It is a shame LEGO relies so much on stickers'
p14467
aS" Helicopter: 6 - if you see it as a set for one fourth of the price of the cars, it is quite amazing, but you can't bag build it and I would personally prefer some more detail instead of the big size"
p14468
aS' Overall it is a nice little set, but the police car is the main attraction'

p14571
aS'" and on that note, let\'s start the reivew of the UCS DEATH STAR II'
p14572
aS" Now this is an older set (2005) and I've only gotten around to buying it a short while ago"
p14573
aS' It took me around 2 evenings to build it and I must say that I am fairly impressed by this set'
p14574
aS" Time for a box pic: The Build: Since I started building this huge (small moon size) set at Morten's appartment, I wanted to keep as few polybags open at any given time as possible"
p14575
aS' With this set it is actually possible to have a minimum of bricks scattered over a table or two while building'
p14576
aS' Not sure why, but the division of bricks in the different polybags just work very well'
p14577
aS' And that is great with a set this size - 3441 bricks'
p14578
aS' The building of the set is divided into several "Build this times x"'
p14579
aS' For example the upper and lower part of the "unshielded" DS are completely alike'
p14580
aS' This is difficult to see when looking at the model, but heaven when building it: And this is how they solved the problem of having the wings connected to the buttom of the Death Star - geniously done IMO: Note that in the first pic the "skeleton" is easily seen'
p14581
aS' "The skeleton" holds the X to which both the upper and lower part is "clicked" on with technic pins'
p14582
aS' Also there\'s a steering wheel (I\'m sure there\'s a pirate name for that ) like the one in the bottom, in the top of the model to hold the upside "wings"'
p14583
aS' So after having build duplicate wings (upper and lower), the "belt" (all the way around the star) and the upper and lower part of the "unshielded" side, it was time to step back and watch the Death Star II in all it\'s glory: Such a great UCS set'
p14584
aS' Now I did have a few "huh\'s" during the build: HUH! #1 In the instruction the technic lesser-dragon-head should be dark grey, but I got it in light gray'
p14585
aS' Go figure and thank you replacement parts'
p14586
aS' I\'ve experienced this before and apparently TLG uses different colours when "out-of-stock"'
p14587
aS" All one has to do is call them and ask for the right colour and it's on it's way Still a HUH! experience"
p14588
aS' HUH! #2 Again it appears that TLG changed the design of the technic axleholed 1x2 bricks'
p14589
aS' The bottom has changed and I got the set where it was mixed up between "old" and "new" version'
p14590
aS' Not that annoying, but still got me perplexed as to: "Am I doing this right?" Kinda stressing to consider taking most of the star apart to check the remaining 231 technic bricks 1x2 with axlehole'
p14591
aS' Now for a verdict: : 1: looks great 2: even my "wife" likes it - female appeal 3: it\'s a great build 4: the polybags work for you 5: it\'s Star Wars 6: the design is awesome : 1: it wobbles if you touch it 2: very small parts come off, if you touch it 3: parts come off when you try to move it somewhere safe 4: zero swooshability So in short (yes even shorter]: The DSII is a well designed UCS set that has a great design'
p14592
aS" Like most other UCS sets, it is not meant for play - hence don't play with it"
p14593
aS" UCS verdict (the numbers) 5/10 (design++/instructions+-/bricks+-/sturdiness--/colourscheme+-) design: awesome look and great greeble set instructions: easy to follow steps with bricks mentioned hard to see wether it's black or dark grey bricks: loads of great bricks a zillion bricks of the same type sturdiness: DON'T TOUCH colouscheme: grey in grey with a little touch of black Need a missing instruction? Then click the logo"

aS'Thanks for the review KimT - it comes at a'
p14595
aS' confusing time You can take off the top disk and lift it like the Millennium Falcon from the top Now'
p14596
aS" I actually don't like this set that much"
p14597
aS' It takes about 5 hours and 15 minutes to build if you do it in one go, but the repeating sections makes this built the most tedious I have experienced'
p14598
aS' It has way too many holes from which you can see the colorful skeleton and is overpriced compared to the older 10030 ISD'
p14599
aS' I remember thinking it was too expensive when it was 50% off at S@H! Even the Snowspeeder was "kewler" to less than half the price:'
p14600
aS'Hmmm, ive still got this set and i must say, i think you did a good job of reviewing it'
p14601
aS' But'
p14602
aS' Overall, i hate the set, probably the worst UCS set so far (apart from the naboo fighter but that hardly even counts as UCS) from my experience'
p14603
aS' Unless you really really want it and have nothing better to spent your $$$ on, in that case go for it'
p14604
aS' But in my case, it was a very repetitive build and final model was quite'
p14605
aS' well, bland, not must variety to it, if you know what i mean'

aS'Thanks for the review'

aS" It's just a big, incomplete, grey ball"
p14660
aS"The build was a bit boring and I suppose a big grey ball isn't all that interesting, but since the Death Star II in the movie is a big grey ball too, I don't see the problem"
p14661
aS" I didn't think it was particularly fragile"
p14662
aS" I don't care about minifigs or playability either"
p14663
aS' A few plusses: in my opinion it looked pretty damn impressive sitting in my LEGO room and the construction is really clever'
p14664
aS' All in all, I actually liked this one, but perhaps I have a different expectation of sets than most of you'
p14665
aS" Sets are mainly parts packs and would you look at the quantity of grey plate in this thing! (It's new grey BTW)"

p14675
aS' I recently picked up this set, and I looked up this review to see what I was getting into'
p14676
aS' Not good news'
p14677
aS' The silver lining is that it was a "Damaged box" deal at Brickworld, so it only cost me $100 (half off the already lowered price) so it was definatley worth it as a parts pack, if nothing else'
p14678
aS' It\'s the last unopened/unbuilt "large" kit in my collection, so even if it is repetetive, I am going to build it anyway'
p14679
aS' It is likely however that I may substitute pieces to do away with the colored interior'
p14680
aS" I've already determined that after it sits on display for a while, I want to do a Zepplin as an alternate build"
p14681
aS' Looking at the parts list it looks like its the perfect set for such an undertaking'

p14690
aS' its a UCS'
p14691
aS' It accurately depicts the on screen icon and put plain and simple is a wonderful sculptural piece of work in its own right'
p14692
aS' I agree with KimT in that the removal of the laser and Super Star Destroyer gives it more authenticity but to call it a gray golf ball or ignore its inherent accuracy is simply to miss the point'
p14693
aS' It proved to be the best build to share with someone, be it family or friend due, to its repeated sections and impressive finish'
p14694
aS' Its a clever build and to criticize it for lack of playability or (I suspect for many) its absence of minifigs is just absurd and possibly why Lego has not released a proper UCS in nearly two years'
p14695
aS' I reckon many out there would love a UCS Tyderium, Imperial Walker or Slave 1 with a spectacular piece count be it minifig scale or just darn impressive in its own right'
p14696
aS" Sadly for those who love these sculptural masterpieces we're stuck with simple toys with 'play features' and cute minifigs"
p14697
aS' Clever in their own right but lacking the clout and purity of the old UCS line'

p14713
aS' nothing special'
p14714
aS' Then we start the build'
p14715
aS' The build is fairly easy, and will take the seasoned builder about 15-20 min to complete'
p14716
aS" Here is the finished model: and bird's eye view: As you can see, this ship is very sleek"
p14717
aS' The fins or "wings" each have an outer slope and an inner one, with the guns in between'
p14718
aS' There are also cones on the front of the fins, which give the ship an even more sleek look'
p14719
aS' In the middle of the wings there is the main body, with a big slope and stripes decorating it'
p14720
aS" This set has a very good playability factor, as I'm about to show you now"
p14721
aS' The guns on the ship are pretty cool looking to begin with; a bley slope attaching a lightsaber hilt and a trans-neon green stud to the fin on each side'
p14722
aS' But theres more than what meets the eye: Yes, the guns flip up! '
p14723
aS'and they can flip all the way back to hide them, for whatever case they need hiding'
p14724
aS' Lets have a look at the back, there is a tail fin used as landing gear and some lightspeed boosters: But wait'
p14725
aS' The tail fin can flip up for flight thanks to a hinge attached to the back of the cockpit'
p14726
aS' Heres another playability factor: The cockpit can slide open very smoothly and easily'
p14727
aS' Heres how this is possible: A clever system under the hood allows the cockpit to open'
p14728
aS' See those two bley pieces on the black ones? Those bley ones attach to the tan plates under the hood, and the hood and windsheild attach to the black peices'
p14729
aS' The black and bley pieces work together as a sliding system, so the cockpit opens'
p14730
aS' Viola! And then the cockpit snaps in place thanks to the red hook and clip'
p14731
aS' Its a very accurate system, and works very well'
p14732
aS" You'll want to open and close it over and over again! Now, finnaly to the fig: The General himself"
p14733
aS' A very impressive fig, with a new head and torso mold'
p14734
aS' In this set, (which is one of only two with Greivous in it) he comes with 2 green and two blue lightsabers, all with bley hilts ( )'
p14735
aS' I was hoping for chrome hilts, but its a minor fault'
p14736
aS' Grievous also comes with a new mold pistol blaster (not pictured)'
p14737
aS' Heres the General in the cockpit (sadly a weak cockpit, no details): He just half lays down on a small slope'
p14738
aS' In this set, he doesnt come with a cape beacuse with it on, the cockpit doesnt close'
p14739
aS' Thats about it, heres the'
p14740
aS' FINAL VERDICT: Build: 7/10 Fairly easy but fun'
p14741
aS' A little bit weak'
p14742
aS' Playability: 8/10 Many playability factors, but some are boring or pointless'
p14743
aS' Swooshability: 8/10 very fun to fly around, sometimes pieces break off'
p14744
aS' Minifigs: 10/10 one amazing fig with 4 lightsabers and a new blaster'
p14745
aS' what more could you ask for? Design: 9/10 very sleek, but hardly any real texture'
p14746
aS' i like it, but others might want greebling'
p14747
aS' Price: 10/10 Overall Score: 9/10 A very cool ship with a very cool minifig and accessories'

aS' but thats only if you hold it from the top and bottom with your fingers and thumb respectivly'
p14773
aS' But if you hold it in your palm or from the sides, it wont break'
p14774
aS' Emphasis on sometimes'
p14775
aS' But dont try to mess around with it by removing its pieces or adding new one, or modding it in any way, because the sliding mechanism wont agree with the mods and break'
p14776
aS' But this hardly takes away from anyone liking this set because, IMO, its perfect just how it is'
p14777
aS'Yeah! General Grievous Starfighter will land in my house! Greate set, i LOVE decals - brown and sandy pattern'
p14778
aS' ingenious! BTW'
p14779
aS' When you show Sith Infiltrator Review? I wait'
p14780
aS'Nice work Jim for your first review'
p14781
aS" I must admit the set didn't really appeal to me at first, but your review has definitely shown off the cool functions built in to this ship, Well Done! Cheers ISC"
p14782
aS'nice review, i bought a couple of these for parts, the only thing i dont like about the ship itself (not the lego version, it does fine) is why is the Grand Droid General flying around in in a small fighter like this, i prefer the battlefront interpretation witch uses it as a bomber'
p14783
aS' anyway, great review! -York'
p14784
aS'thanks again, you guys'
p14785
aS' dont worry, the sith infiltrator review will be up this week'
p14786
aS' My computer has viruses, but now i got FireFox (complete with spell check!), so i should be able to go on the Internet ok from now on'
p14787
aS"Great review! I would get the set, but I'm saving for the Clone Wars sets"
p14788
aS"Great set, great review! I have it too and I am very glad to own it! It will probably be the cheapest and best way to get a Grievous fig for a while (even though it doesn't come with a cape )"

aS' You guys know that you can use the new robot/skeleton arms from the Castle sets to make him hold his lightsabers horizontically, right? I always have him with two of each kind of arm'

aS'Hello all Eurobricks members, I will be doing the second wave of the 2008 Impulse set series, which had released recently'
p14791
aS' I bought this set earlier ago, and will like to share this comprehensive review with everyone of you'
p14792
aS' Name: Troll Warrior Theme: LEGO System / Castle Year: 2008 Pieces: 19 Minifigs: 1 An image of a 5618, Troll Warrior Let the march begin The mighty brave troll warrior, carrying a dangerous cart equipped with a "flick" fire missile'
p14793
aS' Marching into the lands of the Crown Kingdom'
p14794
aS' Crown Knights must be ready for this new troll addition'
p14795
aS" From what I see, this set has a very minimum piece count since it's an impulse set"
p14796
aS' There is no unique parts found in this set'
p14797
aS' However, this set has a couple of useful accessories, such as 2 spears and 2 wooden wheels and a grey mouse running around'
p14798
aS' This set is another alternative for Castle Army builders to buy multiple sets, to build a massive Troll armies'
p14799
aS' In addition, the flick missile really works'
p14800
aS' Use a little bit of force from your finger and flick it, the missile will fly'
p14801
aS' Well, it certainly does not impress me at all with such playing feature'
p14802
aS' Base of the cart Different angles There is one thing I dislike about this set'
p14803
aS' The wooden wheels are too big, and it is the same as the ones in the Crossbow attack'
p14804
aS' I prefer the smaller wheels that exist in old castle sets that produced smaller cart'
p14805
aS' Since this cart size is similar to the old cart size'
p14806
aS" The old wizard's cart is a very good example of the proposed wheel"
p14807
aS' Bits and Pieces Close-up on the warrior and the mouse Summary review Playability: 5'

aS' Bearing in mind that the whole point of this set is to get a cheap troll warrior, I actually quite like it'
p14821
aS" The cart isn't brilliant, but for 13 pieces it's not that bad"
p14822
aS' The troll fig is great as always, and I guess the rats are always nice to get (not so much in real life though)'
p14823
aS' The sets that contain the trolls have a fairly solid number each (I mean, Tower Raid has three!), but nevertheless I think I may have to pick up a few of these'

aS'This is a nice way of building up orc armies, but I do wish it was designed like the Knight impulse set'
p14917
aS' There you have a minifig, enough weapons and armor for two figs and a weapons rack made out of basic pieces'
p14918
aS' Add a generic fig from your collection and you have two knights and the pieces from the rack can be easily used in MOCs'
p14919
aS' The pieces that make up the siege weapon in the Orc impulse are not as easy to use in other creations'
p14920
aS' I\'d rather have seen a "Orcish" weapons rack (different from the Knights rack, but like it, using basic elements) with a second helmet, another weapon, the Orc armor and a shield to put on it'
p14921

aS" I love it! It's simple, well designed, and cute"
p15028
aS' There are some nice pieces in there as well, and I really do quite like the fig- the new coastguard torso looks great'
p15029
aS' Thanks!'
p15030
aS'Excellent review; I like how the new coast guard sets blare out NEW when you see them'
p15031
aS'Thank you for the nice review'
p15032
aS' The set is nice, the pieces are nice'
p15033
aS' And the grey helmet is great for an additional Star wars rebel technician'

aS' Name: Crystal Hawk Theme: LEGO System / Mars Mission Year: 2008 Pieces: 26 Minifigs: 1 An image of a 5619, Crystal Hawk Alpha 3 in Sector 5, reporting to base Alpha 3, Crystal Hawk, reporting for duty, Sir! May I present Mars Mission, latest scout craft, code named "Crystal Hawk"'
p15039
aS' This spacecraft looks very sleek and cool with its usual white and orange color combination'
p15040
aS' I am not a fan of Mars Mission, but these white mini-figs simply attracted me for it'
p15041
aS' In fact, I only owned its impulse sets, and none of its main sets'
p15042
aS' Nevertheless, this set has the "swoosh" factor'
p15043
aS' I was swooshing around in my home last night'
p15044
aS' Well, I am not swooshing it like KimT though'
p15045
aS' Am I seeing double? Haha, the answer is "No"'
p15046
aS' It has double sided face'
p15047
aS' I combined the pictures, to illustrate the two facial expressions'
p15048
aS' Bits and Pieces Different angles Love the way how the wings bend upwards and downwards'
p15049
aS' The only thing I find it a little bit wierd for spacecraft'
p15050
aS' Normally, I thought joystick is the typical navigation controls for a spacecraft instead of a steering wheel? I am not complaining about a steering wheel in a spacecraft'
p15051
aS" To me, it's quite an uncommon sight"
p15052
aS' Anyway, the white steering wheel is an useful part for making vehicles MOCs'

p15105
aS' A nice little set with a nice minifig'
p15106
aS'I really like the look of this Impulse set! even though i sold off my MM sets to buy SW i kept my Astro fighter and this impulse set really appealed from the moment i laid eyes on it'
p15107

aS'Once again, another outstanding review by svelte_corps! I am not a very big fan of Agents, but this theme defintely offer plenty of useful parts'
p15112
aS' This Volcano Base is simply fanastic for parts usage, especially in doing up landscaping, with mountains, by making use of the brown BURPS'
p15113
aS' I must admit that the exterior looks real cool, but the interior looks rather empty'
p15114
aS' These orange slopes certainly make a great illustration of the larva, which gives the Agents a hard time to infiltrate within its compound to save his comrade'
p15115
aS' I am quite sure, this set will defintely attracts lots of kids to coax their parents to buy it, since the bright colors will defintely caught their attention'
p15116
aS' With all those hi-tech, sleek weaponary, I am sure this is the next big thing for kids out there'
p15117
aS' Well, I am not sure if this theme works for me as well'
p15118
aS' But this set defintely works well for landscaping project'
p15119
aS'Thanks for another great review! I definitely like this set'
p15120
aS' Sure, the interior might be a bit bare, but I think that the outside of the base with all of the great lava and rocks more than makes up for it'
p15121
aS' It is a bit weird that on the one side there is nothing on the inside'
p15122

p15175

p15185
aS' Do you plan of doing any other reviews? Or do you have any other sets? Rapid Rider is another great small one, adding a bit of diversity with a water-based vehicle, and you get the Bandit minifig'
p15186
aS" Or you could get The Rock Raiders set, and get all of our spelunking friends (don't make me name them all )"
p15187
aS" Or, if you want a slightly bigger set, Loader Dozer could be the way to go, Axle's a pretty cool minifig too, and you get a rock monster"

p15214
aS'99 USD Brickset Hello everyone, and welcome to my second review on Eurobricks, the Sith Infiltrator! Lets start with a pic of the box, shall we? As you can see, its a Limited Edition set, meaning the fig and set could be worth a lot in the future'
p15215
aS' This set takes about 20 minuets for the seasoned builder'
p15216
aS' An overview of the Infiltrator (also know as the Scimitar): As seen in the picture, this ship is very sleek, with very few studs on top (SNOT= Studs Not On Top)'
p15217
aS' Basically, Its the cockpit with two wings (with two "fins" on each wing), attached to the hull'
p15218
aS' Heres a side view of the Scimitar: Very cool- looking! It lands on two "feet" in the front while the cockpit rests on the ground'
p15219
aS' Rear view: The back'
p15220
aS' The outer cockpit is beautiful, a printed piece on the back (no dreaded sticker sheet! (DSS)) and a large printed disc on top: Heres a look at the middle: There is a flick-fire missile (trans-red cone attach to Technic pin) on the inner wing, a trans-red lightsaber blade in the back of the hull, and a trans-red lightsaber blade in between the fins on either side'
p15221
aS' All of those lightsaber blades may come in handy'
p15222
aS' Hey, look: the fins open from the wings!: The fins open due to double hinges on each fin'
p15223
aS' Unfortunately, you have to hold the ship up in order for the bottom fins to open'
p15224
aS' Now, lets have a look inside the cockpit: To open, you lift the back printed part, which is attached to the printed disc on top, which is attached to a hinge'
p15225
aS' It opens pretty smoothly, but is somewhat loose, so sometimes it closes on its own'
p15226
aS' Also, the disc isnt secured well enough to the door, and often breaks off, even with the smallest movement to it'
p15227
aS' Inside, there is an elevated control panel and two sliding pieces near the floor'
p15228
aS' This ship also comes with a small speeder bike: Its very cleverly built, and is a really neat addition'
p15229
aS' See that clear disc on the bottom? It fits perfectly into the sliding pieces in the cockpit: Hmm'
p15230
aS" whats this?: A hidden compartment! Now this was a very cool idea by TLG, a secret compartment found by taking off the top slope of the hull contains Darth Maul's weapons and tools which include: A (CHROME!) lightsaber hilt, a pair of electrobinouculars, and three probe droids"
p15231
aS' A closeup of a probe droid: Just a plain, black minifig head with a black lever on top'
p15232
aS' Finally, the fig: Darth Maul in the flesh plastic'
p15233
aS' A good fig altogether, with a black hood and lightsaber blades taken from the ship'
p15234
aS' He did come with a crisp, new black cape (packaged in a small, white cardboard box), but I am currently using it for another fig'
p15235
aS' Note that this is a limited edition fig, so stock up'
p15236
aS' A comparison pic of the two Mauls: The 2007 version is on the left, and the 1999 version on the right'
p15237
aS' Note a few key differences between the two: the new one has smaller red tattoos and a smoother torso'
p15238
aS' Also, the new one has bigger eyes and a more cartoony look'
p15239
aS' Maul on the speeder bike: Of course, he fits perfectly in the cockpit wile sitting on the bike, and he can reach the controls: Well, thats about it, here is the'
p15240
aS' FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, easy and fun, breaks every once in a while'
p15241
aS' Playability: 7/10, this set has many features, but is very fragile between the cockpit and hull and between the two cockpit pieces'
p15242
aS' Swooshability: 1/10, too fragile to fly around, plus the flick fire missiles fall out'
p15243
aS' Minifigs: 9/10, a great fig with a chrome hilt and a double sided blade'
p15244
aS' A little cartoony'
p15245
aS' Design: 7/10, very clever techniques, very sleek, but very fragile'
p15246
aS' Price: 8/10, fair enough, could be a few dollars cheaper'
p15247
aS' Overall Score: 6'
p15248
aS'5/10, a very sleek ship with clever building and play techniques, but very, very fragile, and shouldnt be picked up off of the shelf too often'

aS'I got this set last year'
p15262
aS' And I think you made a mistake when you have remove a piece to access the probe droids and equipment, you just have to slide the entire main part'
p15263
aS" And I have a question, is this equipped with the new flick-fire missiles that don't fall off?"

p15267
aS' as for the flick-fire missiles, the do fall off very easily'
p15268
aS'Thank you for the nice review'
p15269
aS" I like the design, although I didn't want to buy it"
p15270
aS' The new little speeder is very nice, but maybe a little to small'
p15271
aS' Darth Mauls eyes are looking a bit more dangerous now'
p15272
aS'A very neatly designed Sith Infiltrator, though I think it lacks the size of the older version'
p15273
aS' A fine ship, but not what I would call a Sith Infiltrator'
p15274
aS' It should be bigger'
p15275
aS' Thanks for another fine SW review KimT'
p15276
aS'Hey all! So I purchased the remaining three Agents sets I needed, and saw that there was no review up yet for this set! Heres the first batch of parts, and the first instruction bits'
p15277
aS' The mini figures'
p15278
aS' The first small vehicles'
p15279
aS' Heres a mistake that I found in the instruction booklet'
p15280
aS' There is no difference between steps 2 and 3'
p15281
aS' The team Inferno boat'
p15282
aS' This is a nice chunky boat, that looks fairly heavy duty and evily'
p15283
aS' Its nice to see the smooth disks on the bottom, that LEGO seemingly havnt done in recent boat/plane sets'
p15284
aS' And the Agents Submarine! This is a nice build aswell'
p15285
aS' Nice and long, with a few hidden compartments'
p15286
aS' One for missiles'
p15287
aS' A place to put the treasure! Some final shots of the completed set! The spare bits! Another special mention has to go out to Slime Face'
p15288
aS' I think he is my favourite ever LEGO character'
p15289
aS' The detail on his unique torso is brilliant! His head is fantastic! And his costume just looks great, with the black and green (Plus green is my favourite colour!) Check out the back of his torso, with the slime pouring down! Deep Sea Quest was 34'
p15290
aS'99 Price ; 9/10 - This is a pretty reasonable price for a fairly substantial set'
p15291
aS' Parts ; 8/10 - A lot of nice bits, few nice boats bits, and a lot of smooth disk things'
p15292
aS' Minifigures ; 10/10 As I said Slime Face is my favourite LEGO character, and the details brilliant! Vehicles ; 8/10 Both very good, with some interesting features'
p15293
aS' Build ; 8/10 A pretty fun build'
p15294
aS' Overall ; 9/10 Its gotta be, if just for Slime Face alone, but this really is a great set!'
p15295
aS"I'm not real fond of slimeface"
p15296
aS' He looks too much like the joker-bombs'
p15297
aS' I was hoping for something newer'
p15298
aS' The slime printing is a nice touch though'
p15299
aS' Steve'
p15300
aS'He does look a bit different though'
p15301
aS'although it hasnt come out well on the photos, there is some green printed slimey bits on his head aswell'
p15302
aS' He honestly is amazing'

p15310
aS' Nice review, by the way '
p15311
aS'Nice review ReZourceman, I wanted to see one of this set'
p15312
aS" It seem's there isn't much to it other than what it looks like in the official pictures, but I may well get it"
p15313
aS' I like Slime Face!'
p15314
aS"Great review, ReZourceman! Your pics really show off the sub well and it's good to see the build in progress"
p15315
aS" I also have this set but I didn't apply stickers to the sub as I was planning to reuse the nice dark blue pieces"
p15316
aS' However as shown in your review they do brighten it up a fair bit'
p15317
aS" I can't say this is my favourite Agents set; the boat is a little oddly proportioned and the sub, although retro looking, has practically no interior and would be difficult to customise to put more in (unlike, say, the clever job Batbrick did with the Penguin sub in his review)"
p15318
aS" The sub kind of looks like some Jules Verneish sea creature - I would have liked it if they'd gone all the way and made it some kind of giant robot jellyfish or squid I do agree with you about Slime Face - he has a fantastic torso with all the slime dripping down which is a bit obscured by the air tank"
p15319
aS" It's really encouraging that in the last 2 Missions we've had great extra villains added in"
p15320
aS" The only thing I would add about the octopus is that the glow in the dark plastic is mixed in unevenly with the aqua blue, so it doesn't glow in the dark evenly - it's kind of like the Mars Mission jellies in that respect though much cooler! Thanks again for the great review!"

p15325
aS' Sort of keep the retro feel but make it bigger'
p15326
aS" With the 8636 sub, there's really only room for one Agent to sit and despite its size, there's just a few (not amazingly great) functions such as the hidden chest and missiles"

p15334
aS'Nice review, thanks! TLC is really going all-out with the Agents theme'
p15335
aS' I wonder if it will last longer than one year (unlike other recent one-and-done themes)'

p15339
aS'Great review'
p15340
aS' This set totally OWNS Alpha Team Deep Sea'
p15341
aS' The sub design actually LOOKS like a sub, the figures are way better, the acessories are better - everything is better! Agents may have my vote for the best theme of the year'
p15342
aS' Quote I wonder if it will last longer than one year (unlike other recent one-and-done themes)'
p15343
aS" Oh don't worry - a second wave will be coming next year"
p15344
aS' This was confirmed by both legomilk and in an interview with an Agents designer'
p15345
aS'Aside from the price, I love this set! When I saw the prelim pics of Agetns I did not like the theme, but all the sets are starting to look more attractive now I can see the cool features and details! As for this set, I really like the bad-guy boat for some reason and the submarine looks good - I love the dark blue colour'
p15346
aS'I forgot to comment on this review! Great job ReZourceman, like svelte-corps said your pics really show off the set and what there is to it'
p15347
aS" I just ordered this and the volcano base off S@h and I can't wait for them to come, so I'll comment on these reviews I forgot about I love the Inferno boat, as you say in your review it looks very heavy duty and ready to take on the Agents"
p15348
aS' The sub I quite like from the look of it, though there is the problem of too little space I will try and correct that'
p15349
aS' The dark blue is especially good'

p15381
aS' The set introduced/infused white and black bricks with classic blue space pieces'
p15382
aS' The result was this great classic vehicle'
p15383
aS" The set includes two figs (still red and white): Here's a view of the vehicle which is really two components, the vehicle itself and the lab section: I absolutely loved the the blue windshield slopes (2 included), and the unique upside-down large blue slope: In the back of the vehicle is the blue lab: The back section of the vehicle has hinges that allow the jets sections to open: The brick design fits perfectly into the lab, and when opened, the lab falls to the ground: NOTE: the little round trans"
p15384
aS' red 1x1s allow the lab to slide up and forward when the jet sections are closed'

aS' The design is very clever, esp'
p15387
aS' for a classic set'
p15388
aS" Here's a shot of the stand-alone lab: Unlike earlier Classic Space windows, this set has train window frames with yellow windows"
p15389
aS" The top of the lab lifts up for playability: Inside the lab are several computers and a swivel chair: Back to the vehicle, here's a shot of the cockpit with white steering wheel: The left side has an upside-down wrench and black antenna: The right side, a walkie-talkie and another antenna"
p15390
aS" The antennas can be used as breaks to keep the middle wheels from moving: Here's ashot of the under carriage: And a final shot of the complete set: For those of you following my Classic Space reviews, this is review number 9 of 10"

aS' One could always "pretend" that some sort of invisible force ray closed the side when activated'
p15479
aS' Invisible force field/ray? That is a very neat idea'
p15480
aS" I don't have much problem with it either"
p15481
aS' Was just curious about the design, as I am not very familar with Classic Space'
p15482
aS' I supposed the oxygen tanks is quite big to carry around, especially when the vehicle is so cramped'
p15483
aS' These allowance of space, makes them much mobile to move about in the vehicle'

p15485
aS' I love the way you modify the front and back'
p15486
aS' Now, I need to find where is the entrance to the Mobile Command Center'
p15487
aS"i've always associated this set with 6929, the Voyager"
p15488
aS" they're of the same timeframe and more or less the same style"
p15489
aS' 6927 is without any doubt my favourite ground vehicle of space'
p15490
aS' it was pretty simple, but it was such a creative set'
p15491
aS' the stories you could tell with this model'
p15492
aS' g'
p15493
aS' most defenitely in my top 5 of space sets'
p15494
aS'This set never got me as a kid'
p15495
aS' I suspect it was because of the wheels; I had mostly Basic sets so it would have been more of the same'
p15496
aS' Looking at it now I can see I have misjudged it, and I love the lab-lift method'
p15497
aS" I'm going to have to build this to see it in action! Thanks for another great review"
p15498
aS'Great review! All-Terrain Vehicle was one of my two favorite LEGO sets ever'
p15499
aS' I have to include a shot of the back of the box, because I love the ideas LEGO provided for this set: hewman, on Jul 11 2008, 01:11 AM, said: Very nice Blacktron-themed 6927! CP5670, on Jul 11 2008, 01:39 PM, said: I just modified mine to make everything fully enclosed: I love your modified 6927 with the enclosed front'
p15500
aS' 2 weeks ago I modified my All-Terrain Vehicle as well, in a similar way, but just *slightly* more modified from the original'
p15501
aS' I call it: 6927-C \'All-Terrain Vehicle Improved Class\' a few clues for anyone to easily build this themselves: Also, a much more extensive modification/MOC that I call 6927-W "All-Terrain Warrior" Quote 6927-W \'All-Terrain Warrior\' I wanted to make a combat variant of 6927, so I used the 6927-C Improved Class as the starting point and went from there'
p15502
aS' I added a completely new forward-cab, close to the ground, for a ground--observer to monitor the terrain'
p15503
aS' I added even larger wheels, allowing this variant to truly be "all terrain", '
p15504
aS'besides, what good is it having a combat vehicle if it gets stuck in the middle of a firefight? The 6927-W has a five man crew: a driver, a gunner who also serves as overall-commander, a terrain observer in the very front'
p15505
aS' In the lab are the weapons systems officer and computer/tech specialist'
p15506
aS' The All-Terrain Warrior vehicle portion is armed with lasers and blaster cannons, with options for other weapons'
p15507
aS' There are short-range nuclear rockets on the lab, guided by the rader control'
p15508
aS' The lab now has blast-proof shutters on the windows protecting the crew from rocket blast'
p15509
aS' Additional protection can be added to the lab, if-need-be, such as more extensive blast-shielding'
p15510
aS' All-in-all, the All-Terrain Warrior is a beast of a machine'
p15511
aS' Two 6927s can protect an entire convoy of standard 6927 or 6927-C'
p15512
aS' These are my very first attempts at modification and doing a MOC of Classic Space LEGO! Edited by ParallaxScroll, 29 August 2009 - 03:03 AM'

aS"Awesome review Brickster! I didn't you are also a Space fan Oh how I love Classic Space The all time perfect LEGO space related theme Everytime I see one I want to buy them more and more, when compared to modern fang dangled sets with detailed figs and cool new accessories, they have nothing on Classic Space, simple beauty Maybe its the blue/grey/trans yellow color scheme Classic Space Forever Edited by Piranha, 30 August 2009 - 07:51 AM"
p15514
aS'Wow! That brings back memories'
p15515
aS' I have that model too (in storage somewhere)'
p15516
aS' The pictures are great'
p15517
aS' I will definitely be checking out more of your reviews'
p15518
aS'Yeah, first time that I am getting a set before everyone'
p15519
aS'^^ First of all: The package The european version has no "Limited Edition" button'
p15520
aS' Hooray!!! Sorry for the blurry back-shot'
p15521
aS' We see the hospital back, a few bubbles with set functions and a little comic'
p15522
aS' Comic: Bubbles: The figures are injured Spongebob, Patrick and the new Fish Doctor'
p15523
aS' Spongebob has a headprint'
p15524
aS'and a backprint (other than the normal Spongebob)'
p15525
aS' Spongebob and injured Bob: The set comes with two litters'
p15526
aS' The ambulance car is a bit extraordinary'
p15527
aS' I dont know how the car is like in the show (and I saw a lot of episodes) but it looks a bit strange, mostly because the weehls are too small'
p15528
aS' Of course we get another SS (not so D this time)'
p15529
aS' The litter fits in the back, with help of this lid'
p15530
aS' I wish it would be the hinge-lid from before 2004'
p15531
aS' Now we come to the meanpart of the set: The hospital! The entrance has got babyblue traindoors and a hudge sign that shows "Emergency"'
p15532
aS' The tubes are nearly everywhere in this set'
p15533
aS' I was getting insane when I came to the part, where I must put the stickers on the tubes'
p15534
aS' This parts are very usefull, but I wanted that the set looks good, because I will display it'
p15535
aS' So I stickered just two of the parts and not all four'
p15536
aS' Now we come to the interroir: The doctor has a desk with computer'
p15537
aS' Sadly its not very well placed and he must duck because of his fin'
p15538
aS' Next to the door, we get this little case, wash basin and two drawers'
p15539
aS' Again we get stickers'
p15540
aS' Not that I dont like stickers'
p15541
aS' Its just: Everytime I get to the part where I must put the stickers on, I think how I can re-use the model and if I rebuild the model, later and and and'
p15542
aS' I hate it to deside! A few posters are in it, too'
p15543
aS' The set is a great addittion to your own Bikino Bottom, but the playability is not very big for the kids'
p15544
aS' They can just play that Patrick steals the ambulance car, like shown on the package, and is hitting Spongebob'
p15545
aS' Than the drive back, the doctor gives Spongebob two medicines and let him go'
p15546
aS' I bought the set mostly because of the parts (tubes in lightbley and a few woodpieces)'
p15547
aS' But I am thinking about let it stand in my little Bikini Bottom (just consist of Crusty Crab and Chum Bucket)'
p15548
aS' Playability: 3/10 Figures: 10/10 Price: 8/10 Design: 9/10 TOTAL: 30/40'
p15549
aS'Thanks for the review, looks like a great set'
p15550
aS" I'm surprised that spongebob's bandage has a full body headprint so kudos to lego for that"
p15551
aS'oh so spongebob was the injured one'
p15552
aS' I thought this set depicted the episode wherein Mr'
p15553
aS' Krabs was the one rushed to the hospital'
p15554
aS'I love the Sponge Bob sets, I have all of them! Nice review'
p15555
aS'Thanks for the review! The interior looks nice, better than I expected, Lots of great parts but, as you say, so many of them are stickered'
p15556
aS" After Rocket Ride, the stickers in the SB sets seem to have gone crazy - the early sets weren't slathered in them"
p15557
aS' 2 new figs though is most welcome'
p15558
aS'Great review'
p15559
aS' As much as I hate spongebob LEGO, I just might get this set'
p15560
aS' It has a good number of useful parts, like the computer and keyboard, and all of the brown pieces'
p15561
aS' How much does this set cost in USD?'
p15562
aS'Great review! I want that set, mainly for patric and the spongebob with the bandage'
p15563
aS' BUT: Why does bob have full length pants? I thought he wore briefs?'
p15564
aS'lots of yummy pics in the review thanks! hmm a double sidied minifig, with a painted top! thats the first time i have ever seen this done!?!? this is a great set and has recieved as evideneced by a lot of "is it new" questions, is sponge bob sets available in Auzzi land? i have not seen them in shops'

p15572
aS' PB Generally not, although as a special sale promotion Target has 3830 Bikini Bottom Express and 3831 Rocket Ride available now (although the sale starts 24 July for 20% off) and K-Mart briefly had the Krusty Krab set last year'
p15573
aS'I ordered the set via S@H and it cost 34'
p15574
aS'99 in Germany, 37'
p15575
aS'99 in Belgium and 50$ in Australia'
p15576
aS' It looks like its a exclusive set, but without the 2limited edition" sticker on the package'
p15577
aS' In the USA its not aviable, now'
p15578
aS' I think it costs as much as the rocket ride (30$)'
p15579
aS' @ Mrs Pegleg: He has the same, short pants, like in the other sets'
p15580
aS'Nice review, the set looks promising'
p15581
aS'Wow, that set looks better than I thought! I just might get it if its under $30 USD'
p15582
aS' I love all the details inside, and it seems to have a better interior than the City hospital'
p15583
aS' and the new figs look nice'
p15584
aS'Thanks for the pics, this set is necessary for each Spongebob-fan, it looks so great'
p15585

aS'Ronan Nissen, on Jul 15 2008, 07:09 AM, said: The fish doctor is supposed to have a new torso'
p15587
aS' Says who? I think the one he has is fine'
p15588
aS'I never have buy a Sponge Bob set but this looks so cool so maybe'
p15589
aS' (Just maybe) I will buy it '
p15590
aS' I am curious of why TLC havent done the Flying Dutchman ship, it was in the first rumor list of Sponge Bob sets, that surely will be a must '
p15591
aS'Awesome, light blue train doors'
p15592
aS' Yummy! It is quite strange that spongbob has become the best source for train parts: the baby blue doors, the orange round windows ,'
p15593
aS'The official name for this Lego set is "The Emergency Room"'
p15594
aS' I have all the other SpongeBob sets, including three Krusty Krabs, two Bikini Bottoms, as well as one of everything else , now all I need to do is wait until next month to buy this set if I find it at my local Toys "R" Us'
p15595
aS' That SpongeBob minifig looks cute'
p15596
aS"I'm not a huge fan of spongebob, but this set I might want also have"
p15597
aS' Maybe I can combine it with the city hospital'
p15598
aS"This set doesn't have much playability, but the hospital is better than the one released by lego recently"
p15599
aS' it has more detail'
p15600
aS' i like it'
p15601
aS'Thanks Navy Trooper Fenson for the review - good one ! I really like that SB is printed! I will need to get this one when I go to the US in two weeks'
p15602
aS' CopMike'
p15603
aS'Nice review, NFT! Im not that much into SpongeBob, but these two pieces just for themselves are interesting to get: container cupboard 4532 and cupboard drawer 4536 the latter not being sold for the last 6 years! Both together are an excellent way to create detailed interiors'
p15604
aS' 6 of those for me, please!'
p15605
aS"There's a lot great pieces in this set, I would be willing to get the set just for them"
p15606
aS' Thanks for the great review!'
p15607
aS"My fish doctor has the torso from 7902 Doctor's Car, which is unfortunate, because the other torso is more stylized and cartoonish, I think"
p15608
aS' However, I did have that mad scientist lab set, so a bit of digging through my old collection will hopefully yield the better torso'
p15609
aS'I recently bought this set for my daughters birthday'
p15610
aS" It's the first BELVILLE set that I've bought for her so it's a bit of an experiment"
p15611
aS" The house is 5 rooms and it's made up of mostly large pieces"
p15612
aS' There still is a decent amount of normal LEGO in it though'
p15613
aS' The doorways in the house align when it is opened out'
p15614
aS' Starting with the bathroom, included is a shower, toilet, sink with vanity and a baby potty'
p15615
aS' The mirror sticker is one of the few that I put on'
p15616
aS' The open plan lounge/kitchen/dining room is well appointed as well and it has a nice glass table and coffee machine'
p15617
aS' The kitchen chairs are Fabuland parts'
p15618
aS" and don't work really well"
p15619
aS' It seems they are having jellyfish for dinner! The clock is the only printed part in the set'
p15620
aS' Upstairs is a baby room and the master bedroom'
p15621
aS' The radio and the TV (not shown) were stickers to my disappointment'
p15622
aS' Up top is an extra room suitable for reading'
p15623
aS' (Those antenna things were made from spare parts by my daughter'
p15624
aS' I have no idea what they are supposed to be'
p15625
aS" ) There are some stickers that go on the back, but I didn't put them on"
p15626
aS" As it is the set looks OK this way, but since it is a dolls house it doesn't really matter"
p15627
aS' I do think though that the fireplace should have been given a back'
p15628
aS' The BBQ is made from normal parts and is quite effective'
p15629
aS" I think it uses the same light brick that's in the 4998 Stegosaurus set"
p15630
aS' My kids were using it as a torch before my grumbling ruined their fun'
p15631
aS' Like all BELVILLE sets, the highlight is arguably the accessories'
p15632
aS" I'll be borrowing a few of these from time to time"
p15633
aS' Here is the controversial baby catapult'
p15634
aS' As you can see, it works OK, but LEGO probably should have tried a bit harder'
p15635
aS' We also bought for her 7583 Playful Puppy'
p15636
aS' It also comes with some nice accessories, but not enough to justify buying unless you want the rest of the parts'
p15637
aS' Poor puppy; where does he sleep? Here is my daughter assembling it'
p15638
aS' She made me make the house though as she wanted to play a game we bought her'
p15639
aS" (Note the LEGO drink bottles! ) I didn't take any photos of the figures as they don't seem to be anything new, but I can if people want me to"
p15640
aS" At the time I was in bit of a hurry as I took these before bed so I wouldn't be stressed if the kids broke it the next day"
p15641
aS" Overall, these sets seem overpriced to me, and hard to justify unless you actually want a buildable doll's house"
p15642
aS' (Which we did'
p15643
aS") It's still too early to tell if my daughter likes it or not"
p15644
aS' but at this stage it seems she lost interest in a few days'
p15645
aS' She does tend to go back to toys though'

aS'mommy and daddy are naughty!'
p15649
aS"Yay! It's good to see your kids get to build some stuff too, Sinner "
p15650
aS" All through the review I was thinking 'This was a present - but who actually put it together?' so I'm glad the last pic cleared things up As for the set - it looks much bigger than I expected - I think it does make a good sized dollhouse"
p15651
aS' There are a stack of nice pieces in there - cupboards, oven, trans-blue 2x5 bricks, all the accessories, plants, flowers, food, the light-up brick, the pink roof slopes - but not enough to justify the $AUD129 retail price'
p15652
aS" Maybe on sale I'd pick it up and resell the Belville figs but David Jones hasn't even had a regular 20% off Lego sale for the whole of this year that I've seen"
p15653
aS' I think the Playful Puppy set is a horrendous ripoff for $AUD20 though'
p15654
aS' I agree with the baby catapult - the range is terrible'
p15655
aS" Lego just isn't trying any more, is it? At least they've moved on from throwing cats off three storey buildings"
p15656
aS' 2 questions though'
p15657
aS' 1) Was it a fun build? 2) Are those large figs anatomically correct under their frou-frou finery? If not, what the hell are they doing in the second pic whilst baby Sylvia explores the oven?'
p15658
aS"Excellent review! It's nice to see how"
p15659
aS" it's nice to see how "
p15660
aS" it's nice "
p15661
aS" Okay, I can't get over the sex in the bedroom and the unattended baby crawling into the oven"
p15662
aS" I didn't read anything else except, where does the puppy sleep and my daughter made me build this"
p15663
aS" You are sick and twisted and that's why I love you! It seems you are coining the Belville edge"
p15664
aS' Now will you please stop sitting around eating clams and get that baby out of the oven or make the fun in the bedroom a three-way? Please! Thank you PS'
p15665
aS' OK, I read it'
p15666
aS' I want the baby toilet and I think the jellyfish is supposed to be a jello-mold'

aS' As for the fire place piece i love it and i want one, ever since finding it on MLcad!!! I love the BBQ, it looks so good!, you know i might even buy this, it it was not so pink! Now as for the kiddies, in ovens, make sure they are not over cooked they can be stringy , and as for the couple up stairs, now we at least know what you do with your mini figs when no one is looking/ lego sets in public places , just following your name sake i guess And i must say Lego, shame, shame, that catapult needs reviwing, hardly even make a dent in a castle wall!

p15680
aS' eh'
p15681
aS" Thanks for the review, though, it's very nicely presented and leaves no doubt in my mind as to just how easy this set would be to misuse for other purposes"
p15682
aS'Nice review, good to see your almost letting your kids play with your lego I like the functionality of the baby catapult, its good that they include some working features in a build this big! Are you not showing the figures because its really Hugh Hefners Playboy/Belville Mansion? I dont see the grotto though, must be an add on set like the poor puppy! Its just so darn PINK'

p15729
aS' 1) Was it a fun build? 2) Are those large figs anatomically correct under their frou-frou finery? If not, what the hell are they doing in the second pic whilst baby Sylvia explores the oven? It was sort of fun, but it really is just a lot of big pieces'
p15730
aS' The kitchen stove is smart though'

aS' Patience '
p15753
aS' Great review, by the way'
p15754
aS' The Belville sets are indeed overpriced, but they\'re probably Lego\'s best attempt at wooing the girl audience (I still hate the fact that TLC thinks they need separate "boy" themes and "girl" themes, but whatever)'
p15755
aS" They're a very nice alternative to Barbie -- you get posable figures with realistic body proportions, plus some creativity and building aspects thrown in"
p15756
aS"I bought this today, mainly because it was 25% off, but I'd been eyeing it for a long time"
p15757
aS" The accessories truly are brilliant! There's so much here to be pillaged for other uses, as people have said"
p15758
aS" I picked up heaps of new parts I've never had, or rare ones in even rarer colours"
p15759
aS' To be honest, I was surprised and impressed by the range and versatility of the regular bricks as well'
p15760
aS" When you look at the box art, what jumps out at you are the giant pink walls and curved pieces, but there's a nice amount of white arches and lime green bricks, not to mention all the windows and the trans blue 1x2x5 bricks"
p15761
aS" And plants! It's a good thing the target audience likes stickers though, there's more here than I've seen on any set except the 7709 Sentai Fortress! I think they were aiming for one sticker per page of instructions I hope Belville returns in 2010 Thanks for the review, Sieggy! Did your daughter ever go back to it?"

p15772
aS'99 USD Brickset Welcome to my third review on Eurobricks, I hope you enjoy! While at any store that sells LEGO (Target, Wal-Mart, TRU, etc'
p15773
aS'), you will notice that the clone battle packs on the shelf are way fewer in number than the droids battle pack'
p15774
aS' As you might guess, the clones are way more popular, and finding them gets harder and harder as the release date of this set goes farther into the past'
p15775
aS' So stock up! Alright, heres a pic of the box: A small box, as expected for inexpensive sets like these'
p15776
aS' Note the "Build your army" button on the front: TLG obviously is encouraging customers to buy multiples, and with good reason, which will be explained later in this review'
p15777
aS' Well, lets get straight to it: The contents of this set'
p15778
aS' You will notice a speeder bike, a gun turret, and some clones'
p15779
aS' Looking good so far! Lets have a look at the turret: An excellent Star Wars element to have around, especially for MOCing'
p15780
aS' It is very cleverly built, using a tire guard from CITY sets for the general shape of the turret mount'
p15781
aS' All you have to do is attach the (new mold! explained later) gun to the 2x1 plate with the center stud, and'
p15782
aS' Presto! I wonder how the clones build these turrets to fast in the middle of battle'
p15783
aS' A rear view: With a clone mounted: My only gripe about the turret is that you have to take off the gun in order for every clone to have a gun'
p15784
aS' Now, we move on to the vehicle of the set, the speeder bike: A rather sleek and good looking bike, with some useful pieces on it as well, such as the blue cones, the megaphones, and the engines'
p15785
aS' Some say it looks bare without the figs mounted on it, but I think it looks just fine'
p15786
aS' The commander drives while a trooper shoots on the back'
p15787
aS' A side view: And a rear view: My only gripe is the same as the turret: you have to remove the back gun for all the clones to have weapons while on foot'
p15788
aS' The back pistol attaches to a 2x2 round studded plate with a Technic hole in the middle'
p15789
aS' Finnaly, here are the new guns: This set comes with 1 new blaster rifle and three new pistols'
p15790
aS' It could have included one more rifle for the turret'
p15791
aS' And of course, the figs: Includes: 1 yellow commander (lovely fig), 1 Shocktrooper (comes with a pair of elctrobinouculars), and two regular troopers (so clean and white)'
p15792
aS' The figs are excellent, all that any SW or LEGO fan should want'
p15793
aS' It could have maybe included one more regular trooper, but that might be pushing it'
p15794
aS' Thats all for now, folks, here is the'
p15795
aS' FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, extremely easy, should take the seasoned builder about 5 minutes to complete'
p15796
aS' A fun build, though'
p15797
aS' Playability: 5/10, I guess you can get this with the droid battle pack and make them battle, but this set has no real play features of its own'
p15798
aS' But it is good for collecting troops and using them for MOCs'
p15799
aS' Swooshability: 9/10, I guess you can zoom the speeder bike around'
p15800
aS' Minifigs: 10/10, four great figs that should be bought in multiples, a great army builder'
p15801
aS' Design: 10/10, a clever turret, an awesome speeder, and four great clones'
p15802
aS' What more do you need in a 10 dollar set? Price: 8/10, not bad I suppose, but if you calculate a dime for each piece, this set should come out to 5-6 dollars'
p15803
aS' But still, billions of these are being sold world-wide, and TLG is making a ton of money off of them'
p15804
aS' Overall score: 9'
p15805
aS'5/10, a truly memorable set, one that will be a favorite for ages to come, and very popular'
p15806
aS' A great army builder for a small price, plus vehicle and turret! With only a few very minor flaws, this set is one of the best of Star Wars'
p15807
aS' And this concludes my review, and as always, comments are most welcome'
p15808
aS'I got like 5 of theses Hope we get the New clone battlepack, Do you ever think we will? We will only get 5 Clones if you buy all the New Republic sets'

p15826
aS'99 USD Brickset Hi everybody, and welcome to my fourth review on Eurobricks'
p15827
aS' Today, I will review the Droid Bttle Pack set'
p15828
aS' NOTE: This set originally came with four megaphone blasters for each battle droid, but I replaced them (along with the crooked arms) with the new blaster pistols and new twisted arms'
p15829
aS' A picture of the box: As it is on the shelves of major-retail stores'
p15830
aS' A small box, as expected for inexpensive sets like these'
p15831
aS' Note the "Build your army" button on the front: TLG obviously is encouraging customers to buy multiples, and with good reason, which will be explained later in this review'
p15832
aS" An overview of the set's content: You can see a droid carrying vehicle, a STAP, and some battle/ super battle droids"
p15833
aS' A look at the carrier: A light tank'
p15834
aS' Note the guns on the front: The guns and cockpit can turn a little bit left and right from the main body'
p15835
aS' Also, the guns can move up and down, free from the cockpit: And check out the cockpit: Two 2x1 center studded plates side by side for the pilot to stand on'
p15836
aS' Now, moving on to the STAP: A small, very useful vehicle in the SW universe'
p15837
aS' These are seen frequently in both the movies and games (as well as other multimedia)'
p15838
aS' The design is very clever, using vertical building and a clear stand'
p15839
aS' Rear view: The guns/ handlebars can go this far back: And finally, the figs: The figs are very good, but very common'
p15840
aS' We havent seen SBDs in a while, and now instead of metallic blue, they are metallic dark grey'
p15841
aS' The worst part of this set is that the battle droids have the old arms and guns, while the droids in the MTT and clone pack (both of the same year as this) have the new ones'
p15842
aS' I wonder why TLG decided to do that'
p15843
aS' again, This set originally came with four megaphone blasters for each battle droid, but I replaced them (along with the crooked arms) with the new blaster pistols and new twisted arms'
p15844
aS' So thats about it, heres the'
p15845
aS' FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, very easy, should take the seasoned builder about 5-10 minutes'
p15846
aS' Playability: 6/10, has a few play feature, but nothing exciting'
p15847
aS' Is good for MOCs and army building'
p15848
aS' Swooshability: 8/10, I suppose you could fly around the STAP'
p15849
aS' Minifigs: 7/10, the battle droids are good, but very common, and the dont come with new arms or guns'
p15850
aS' The SBDs are very nice, and in a new color'
p15851
aS' All figs are great for army building'
p15852
aS' Design: 8/10, the STAP was clever, but the carrier was a little bulky'
p15853
aS' Price: 10/10, as fair as it gets'
p15854
aS' Overall: 7'
p15855
aS'5/10, the figs are great to have and make MOCs and armies, and the vehicles are pretty cool (the carrier is a little lame)'
p15856
aS' The main problem with this set is that the BDs dont get the new guns or arms, so they dont fit in with all the new sets'
p15857
aS' Also, droids arent as cool as clones'
p15858
aS' But the price is very fair'
p15859
aS' And now, my review has ended'
p15860
aS" Unfortunately, I believe this will be my last review for a long time for two reasons: one, the remaining sets that arent done (according to KimT's index) I either don't have or are broken or have missing pieces"
p15861
aS' and two, my budget is low right now, and I wont be able to get the Clone Wars sets right when they are released, so someone will probably beat me to reviewing them'
p15862
aS' Too bad, because I would love to do an RGS review'
p15863
aS' well, as always, comments very welcome!'
p15864
aS'Thanks for the review'

aS'Hello all Eurobricks members and Town Lovers, This is my first classic town review'
p15885
aS" For today, I will be featuring the 6641, 4-Wheelin' Truck which is produced in 1987"
p15886
aS' For some younger members in EB, you might not have encounter such a baby roaming down the streets, horning at others with its big massive truck'
p15887
aS' Considering this is a 1987 set, such a vehicle size is considered big in those days'
p15888
aS" Name: 4-Wheelin' Truck Theme: LEGO System / Town Year: 1987 Pieces: 80 Minifigs: 1 Price: USD$6"
p15889
aS'50 An image of a 6641, 4-Wheelin\' Truck *Hello Everyone* Why the name 4-Wheelin\' Truck? It is because this truck is equipped with 4 heavy duty wheels which is considered "big" among other small vehicles in Classic Town'
p15890
aS' Please take note, most of the vehicles that are produced in Classic Town era, are 4-studs wide'
p15891
aS' This truck is no exception'
p15892
aS' Meet the driver and his truck! This truck has a very good combinations of different colors that are common for most town vehicles'
p15893
aS' It made used of blue, white and red as its primary combinations'
p15894
aS' I find that this combinations is quite soothing to its eyes especially the blue bricks'
p15895
aS' In addition, the mini-fig torso is superb'
p15896
aS' The driver must be a great fan of this vehicle'
p15897
aS' I realised most truck drivers in the classic town era wear this most of the time'
p15898
aS' I wonder if its some kind of an organization? Front view There is 2 red doors coupled with the truck, to enable the driver to get in properly'
p15899
aS' This vehicle is considered big in the 1980s'
p15900
aS' However, if you compared it with the current city vehicles, this truck certainly will not outsize the current designs'
p15901
aS' Please take note of the wheels'
p15902
aS' The wheels are pretty different'
p15903
aS" I don't remember seeing these wheels in many other vehicles, maybe some members can help me on this"
p15904
aS' Most of the classic town vehicles have a window frame on top which is known as a "sun-roof"'
p15905
aS' In this set, this feature is also included'
p15906
aS' Furthermore, the vehicle frame has a simple mechanism which all town lovers love'
p15907
aS' It is to lift it up and place their driver in and out the seat'
p15908
aS' Most importantly, you do not have to take off the entire window frame just to put in the driver'
p15909
aS" Different angles of the 4-Wheelin' Truck SNOT Technique? Back 20 years ago, LEGO had been experimenting with SNOT technique"
p15910
aS' You can see that the back looks very neat without the studs'
p15911
aS' In addition, it can be quite useful to place a mini-fig on top of it, or throw some baggage for some quick getaway'
p15912
aS' Summary review Playability: 8/10 (Great addition to your Town collection'
p15913
aS') Design: 8'
p15914
aS'5/10 (Very good design'
p15915
aS' I love 4-studs truck'

aS'5/10 (A must have for all Classic Town lovers, we have been complaining for more wider range of vehicle) I gave it a "4" based on my Review Score Card'

aS' A few years later I got the safari truck, which is also really sweet'
p15945
aS' I like the colors of this model and the detail of it'

aS' i probably would not have bought this as a kid in 1987, unless i had money to spare or the shop had no other set from space or castle, the two other big lines in 1987, and no better set in the town section'

p15953

p15962
aS' In white, I can only find a handful of minifig sets that they are included with'
p15963
aS" There's half a dozen space sets but, apart from the 4-Wheelin Truck, the only other Town set appears to be the 6524 Blizzard Blazer (tractor with snow plough)"
p15964
aS' The wheels were also in a Train set called 4549 Road & Rail Hauler where they were the wheels on a big forklift'
p15965

p16064
aS' I think the great thing about the cottage is its very reminiscent of classic holiday home type houses that Lego used to make like this one from the late 80s which a lot of people (me included) believe Lego need to make more of'
p16065
aS'I now found pics, too'
p16066
aS" That's absolutely ! After 10188 Town Plan this is the best City set ever! I really like the neat landscape with the little hill (there are a bench and some flowers on it, too ) and this brilliant cottage ! Great idea with that power function that the wind mill turns and then enable the lights of the cottage ! Concerning the City theme I must say: In the last time TLG comes up with one great surprise after the other"
p16067
aS" Does anyone know where and when it'll be available (this year I think - otherwise there wouldn't be already pics, would they?) and how much it'll cost (I think about 70 Euros, what do you think?)? I only hope that it'll be available in Germany, too, otherwise I would be really if I am not able to get it since it is a must for every City and environment fan!

aS"I also found the pics, and most of what I can say is: It's kind of funny how it's a small house with a gigantic windmill over it, though"

p16076
aS"I recently got a few still sealed and new sets from the 90' on ebay, and after the Rock Raider's Hover Scout this isthe second one i'll review"
p16077
aS' I really like the space port theme, even if the sets may be more simple than earlier space city sets, i like the overall look and the color scheme'
p16078
aS" But enough of that, let's go on with the pictures! Set Nr"
p16079
aS': 6455 Name: Space Simulation Station Number of minifigs: 3 Number of pieces: 240 Release Year: 1999 First again a few pics of the boxes and the instructions: The main box: This theme had a kinda strange seperation of the pieces, the parts for the control center and the shuttle are in seperate little boxes, and the others are in polybags with the models printed on them'
p16080
aS" Also seperate instructions for each step: A general overview: We got 3 lovely minifigs here, from left to right the control engineer, the mechanic and the astronaut: The -i dont know the english word for it- testing-thing, the astronaut is being tested to hard nerves there The mechanics little car, on the back an extinguisher and a radio device is attached: the take-off station for the little shuttle with the shuttle itself on it: And without it: Tools, tools, tools! The shuttle as stand-alone: i think that would be fuel tanks, i like this little detail: And finally we have the controll room, would have been better with seats, but it's alright: A really sweet mid-sized set if you ask me, a few juniorized parts, but it fits perfectly with the set"
p16081
aS' The theme itself is also great, and i wish that TLG brings it back, i could see stunning sets with the quality city sets have right now!'
p16082
aS"you just bring memory's back i never had one of the space port sets, but i know that as a little boy i visited my toy store and kept on looking to the boxes"
p16083
aS' on BL those sets cost too much for what ist worth today'
p16084
aS' really, TLC should bring this theme back! Space port ON!'
p16085
aS"In the catalog images I thougt that the base was on a 16'16 baseplate"
p16086
aS' I have some sets of space-port and like them, but I would want real town sets in 1999'

aS"*mini-bump* Wow, I'd completely forgotten about this theme, which is suprising since I absolutely loved this theme as a kid (minus the sound n' light brick, which I thought was pretty big and ugly)"
p16099
aS' Sure brings back memories of looking at those little catalogue booklets that came with the sets'
p16100
aS'I had never seen this set or this theme before'
p16101
aS' It was released during my dark age, and I had missed it'
p16102
aS" It's nice to see such sets, surface once again, to educate members like me that there are some good sets we had missed during the dark age"
p16103
aS' And, I must admit that this is a very good set'
p16104
aS" It's comes with 3 mini-figs and Staudie with it"
p16105
aS' Geez, I never thought he was an astronaunt back then'
p16106
aS' The testing facility is great, and I love to see it spin, by putting Staudie in it for a "test-run"'
p16107
aS" The buggy is cute as well, but somehow, I don't really like the white frame at the back"
p16108
aS' It looked a little odd to me'
p16109
aS' The tools, are simply wonderful to have'
p16110
aS' Furthermore, these are grey tools'
p16111
aS' The last time, we had so many tools are the aeroplane mechanic'
p16112
aS' The shuttle is nice, but does the shuttle supposed to come with a cover as well? I guess, since this is a simulator, they must have cut down the budget for it'
p16113
aS' The control room is good, and it will be even better with chairs included'
p16114
aS' metalandi, thanks for the wonderful review!'
p16115

aS'UPDATE: I WILL BE MERGING REVIEWS AS THEY GO IDLE, THIS IS NOW THE DINO ATTACK REVIEW THREAD "What, Jay\'s not doing Viking reviews!?" Nope, I think Christopher110 took care of those just fine'

aS' Instead, I have brought you what is most possibly the HIGHEST-ANTICIPATED set of the year (;) :D) - the T1 Typhoon'
p16136
aS" And I gotta say - Dinos apart, it's actually really cool"
p16137
aS" The Dinos Let's get the worst over with"
p16138
aS' Yes'
p16139
aS" Those are ALL the parts in that 'dino'"
p16140
aS"The Figs They're possibly the best part of the entire set, all in all"
p16141
aS' Nice new head, although the glasses limit its usability'
p16142
aS' I am in LOVE with the head on that fig'
p16143
aS" It's perfect for any number of figures - a good 'scarred hero' face has always been on my want list"
p16144
aS" I'm turning him into my Viking warlord after I post this review"
p16145
aS' Again, a new head'
p16146
aS' Great stubbly beard thing going on'
p16147
aS' My second-favorite head of the lot'
p16148
aS' Great for warriors, especially with helms'
p16149
aS" The torsos are fantastic for special forces figures, if anyone's planning to do something like that"
p16150
aS" Not TOO fond of the lime green on there, but it's still extremely usable"
p16151
aS' This is actually a really cool machine gun'
p16152
aS' I like it'
p16153
aS' I think this would be a good point to note that ALL designs you see - outside the figures and dinos - are stickers'
p16154
aS' That means a crapload of stickers'
p16155
aS" If you can't stand stickers at all in a set, don't buy this"
p16156
aS'The Copter This is one BIGASS copter'
p16157

aS' Upper cockpit with cool computer'
p16161
aS' See above'
p16162
aS' Awesome gatling gun'
p16163
aS' Yes, even the TECHNIC BEAMS have stickers'
p16164
aS" I'm actually really fond of that little canister thing"
p16165
aS' I can see using it elsewhere'
p16166
aS" Yes - that's a sticker"
p16167
aS' The rope and hook'
p16168
aS' I forgot to mention it before, this set comes with two accessories besides the machine gun - binocs and one of those little things to slide down the rope'
p16169
aS" Also, the thing that 'extends' the rope turns"
p16170
aS" The other side, because they're slightly asymmetrical"
p16171
aS' One of my favorite stickers'
p16172
aS" The door says 'SURVIVAL EQUIPMENT'"
p16173
aS" It's on both sides"
p16174
aS' Definitely a keeper'
p16175
aS'The base of the propeller'
p16176
aS" It wobbles a bit, but doesn't fall off"
p16177
aS' Very sturdy'
p16178
aS' Right side of the rear propeller'
p16179
aS' And the left (and better) side'
p16180
aS' The tail'
p16181
aS" It uses construction similar to the X-wing's nose, but on a larger scale"
p16182
aS' Definitely cool'
p16183
aS' A very neat part of the copter'
p16184
aS' The guns are constructed so that'
p16185
aS' they turn without turning the cockpit'
p16186
aS' The interior is rather blase, though'
p16187
aS'Another of my favorite parts - landing gear'
p16188
aS' This is the front section'
p16189
aS' and it retracts! Unlike most ships with landing gear, this does NOT retract without effort (coughXWINGcough)'
p16190
aS' Very sleek'
p16191

aS"4/10 Parts: 8/10 Figs: 10/10 Dinos: 2/10 Copter: 9/10 Value: 7/10 Don't Buy If: - you can wait for Vikings - you don't like any set with stickers - you're not a space fan Buy If: - you're a space fan - you don't mind stickers/don't apply them - you're like to create cool figures Overall, I think it was worth the price, even at 605 pieces"
p16196
aS" However, I'd suggest buying Vikings even considering this"
p16197
aS' Well, hope this review (unexpected as it was ;-)) helped someone out there'
p16198
aS' Until next time, Bloody Jay'
p16199
aS'As unexpected as it was, this was very helpful! ;) Three questions, though: 1'
p16200
aS' Is the front green rubber missle a traditional launchable missle, or does it have another firing mechanism? 2'
p16201
aS' Concerning the guns on the side, are they fixed in one postition, or does it have any functions? 3'

aS'I really want those figs'
p16215
aS'damm you Bloody Jay!!!'
p16216
aS"Great Review Jay !!!!! Tks a lot ;) I am not that of the big fan of the copter due to its proportions - but I admit its really asome looking, better as I expected :oD The best are those MFs !!!!!! They are truly awsome !!!!!!! I wiil but some of the smaller sets just for the figs hehe (too bad that my favorite - your second best - don't come in the smallers sets :'( )"
p16217
aS' Are you going to review the other sets as well ??? That could be cool !!!!!'
p16218
aS'Thanks, Bloody_Jay'
p16219
aS' Another brilliant review'
p16220
aS' I really like the helicopter'
p16221
aS" Though I hate the stickers (it seem like there are a lot of it), it won't stop me from buying it"
p16222
aS' Too bad that when will the Dino line arrive in Singapore'
p16223
aS" :'( Guess I've have to wait for the meanwhile"

aS' sam, missing your point'
p16229
aS' The set _should_ come to Europe, as 7298, but without guns (large crate instead)'
p16230
aS'Hmmmm '
p16231
aS' interesting'
p16232
aS" It's a shame though, because I really like the guns"
p16233
aS" Any idea when it should come to Europe? EDIT: I've just scene the Official DINO Attack site, which says they're coming to Europe in October"
p16234

aS' to the ones in Europe'
p16236
aS"No, there aren't any pictures yet"
p16237
aS'Photos are not available, but basically it is: -guns +chains +ropes +crates'
p16238
aS'Wow, great review, for a great set'
p16239
aS' Thanks Jay'
p16240
aS' I really like it, although to big for my city'
p16241
aS' :( I too really like the MFs'
p16242
aS' Because of your review, I am definitely considering it'
p16243
aS' Thanks again, LegoBmw'
p16244
aS"That's interesting news about the European release"
p16245
aS" I'd definitely be interested to see how they modify the set - chains, ropes, and crates are definitely useful pieces"
p16246
aS" Can't wait for pictures"
p16247
aS" To everyone looking for just the figures - don't skip out and get the smaller set and the tank"
p16248
aS' Spend the extra $20 and get the T1'
p16249
aS" It's well worth it"
p16250
aS' I might pick up the Steel Sprinter and the Fire Hammer myself, still trying to decide'
p16251
aS" If I do, I'll review them"
p16252
aS"I guess we'll have to wait for the photos! Officially announced by LEGO, the Dino Attack line is going to be made available in Europe in October 2005"
p16253
aS' EDIT: Check out the official Dino Attack site here!'
p16254
aS'Yeah, I picked up another one'
p16255
aS" I really liked the chopper! Let's cut straight to the chase"
p16256
aS' Dinos: First the worst, of course'
p16257
aS" These things are so horrible, they don't deserve more than one photo"
p16258
aS" They're rubbery, one piece, and the only things that remotely indicate that they're made by LEGO are the holes on the bottom of their feet"
p16259
aS" They're unrealistic to an extreme unmatched by even the previously reviewed Dinos, in that they are waaaaaaaay too thin, one is pink, and they're all grinning"
p16260
aS' Fig: One interesting thing to note is that this one has the same torso as the iron-masked dude in the chopper, not his own bare-arms torso'
p16261
aS' Pic for the sake of comparison'
p16262
aS" Now, I don't consider this fig as good as the others because the other heads are useful for Vikings and assorted castle-type people, but this has sunglasses"
p16263
aS" All in all, you'll probably find it useful, but I don't"
p16264
aS' Still, great torso for special ops stuff'
p16265
aS' Hummer: Those headlights - while stickers (yes, all prints are again stickers, although there are much less than the chopper) - are great pieces'
p16266
aS' I can see using them as furnace covers or stove burners'
p16267
aS' The windshield/hood area'
p16268
aS' Not much to say about this one'
p16269
aS" Driver's side"
p16270
aS' My question? When this is brought to Europe, will the steering wheel switch sides? ;) Seriously though, I love that little steering wheel piece more than I love taffy'
p16271
aS" And I'm a man who enjoys his taffy"
p16272
aS' Left side in its entirety'
p16273
aS' and the right side'
p16274
aS' View through the right side - no seat here'
p16275
aS" Could've done with another fig to fill the nonexistant seat, as well"
p16276
aS'The'
p16277
aS' weapon'
p16278
aS" Whatever it's called"
p16279
aS" This uses the same mechanism as the longboat (for those that don't have either, you snap the little sports stand thing, which hits the 'missile', which fires, and since there's nothing holding the technic beam up to that height any more, it drops down so that the next missile drops into place"
p16280
aS' Pretty cool, if unrealistic'
p16281
aS" The two on the side do NOT fire, I think they're mainly there for 'extra ammo'"
p16282
aS' My biggest problem with this set'
p16283
aS' Open bed'
p16284
aS' This could have easily been remedied with a few plates'
p16285
aS' Interior opened'
p16286

aS" However, if you're a bigger castle fan, or just like to get all sorts of LEGO, I would still suggest buying the Viking Catapult before this"
p16293
aS' However, I do think that these are some of the coolest sets of 2005'
p16294

p16307
aS' Got it 2 days ago, thanks to a fast shipping from S@H this time, and i found time now to review it now'
p16308
aS" Enough of the babbling, let's let the facts and pictures speak, which actually turned out pretty well this time"
p16309
aS' Set Nr'
p16310
aS': 4210 Name: Coast Guard Platform Number of minifigs: 4 Number of pieces: 469 Release Year: 2008 A few shots of the box first: 2 Books of Instructions we got here, first one for the helicopter second one for the rest and the platform itself: A general overview of the platform from above: The 4 minifigs, 3 rescue guys and one oil rig worker (?)'
p16311
aS' The pilot seems not very happy that he has to work in the middle of nowhere at sea Right beside the entry of the tower we have the diving equipment holder: Next, the guy can jump in this little speedboat'
p16312
aS'and another guy brings it down to water with the crane: If somebody is rescued from the air, he arrives here and is brought to the tower with the little moving platform than runs on "rails": Down under we got a buoy and several life belts and extinguishers: With the lift somebody who is rescued by the boat can be brought up'
p16313
aS" I think it would been better if they would have made a mechanism there to bring it up, but it's okay: A few floors higher the sea is being observated and watched: On the ground level we have the medical station/warm-up room: The helicopter as stand-alone: All in all for me this is besides the police station THE city set of this year"
p16314
aS" It's got great features, and looks fantastic and also has many useful pieces"
p16315
aS" You can't do anything wrong with buying it, 10/10 for me! That's all for now, hope you liked my review"
p16316
aS' Edit: Oh damn, i forgot to write "review" in the topic title, can a mod please add this? Thanks!'

aS'Thanks for the awesome review, metalandi! Your pics are very clear and you go into detail about all the functions of the set'
p16322
aS' I agree, this is a great set - one of the best of the CG line for sure, way better than the boat set with the tower on the Bionicle baseplate, and cheaper too'
p16323
aS' I even like the helicopter better than the oversized version'
p16324

p16333
aS" It's always great to see early pictures of new sets"

p16369
aS' Im not sure about the bottom floor glass being dark grey and the top floor glass being light blue'
p16370
aS'I think it looks good on the real set'
p16371
aS' I thought, the darker glass might be good on the ground level so the rescued guy has it nice and dark in there'
p16372
aS'Nice review! This is just the "Crown Jewel" for the Coast Guard theme'
p16373
aS' I love the layout of its platform'
p16374
aS' It looks real neat to have it placed it in the midst of the deep blue sea, awaiting of any emergency rescue'
p16375
aS' Sometimes, I feel that this set can used it to merge with my Aqua Raiders sets'
p16376
aS' I thought of using it as a land base, for the raiders to dock in their stuff before submerge into the ocean'
p16377
aS" Ok, it's just a wierd idea of mine"
p16378
aS" Just feel that Aqua Raiders and Coast Guard can work hand in hand, since they are naval expertise! It seemed, I can't view all the pictures somehow"
p16379
aS' Nevertheless, I can still view some of it quite well'
p16380
aS' I love the command center'
p16381
aS' The amount of computer printed pieces simply make me smile, with the monitor, keyboard, radar screen and etc'
p16382
aS' The helicopter is cute too'
p16383
aS' However, I pity the victim that is loaded at the back'
p16384
aS' It seemed a little bit too dangerous'
p16385
aS' In addition, this set seemed to have quite alot of stickers, which can be quite discouraging'
p16386
aS' I do hope to see this set soon'
p16387

p16393
aS' I also agree with svelte i like this little chopper better then the big one and it actualy has a place to "stay" instead of the big one theres no landing pad for the big one too go on in any CG set so far'
p16394
aS' and its only $80 AUSD'
p16395
aS'I agree with both of you'
p16396
aS' First, i have to add, that a few of the stickers were a bit annoying as it comes to put them on espacially the ones on the helicopter, where you have to put them on round parts'

p16416
aS" Reason: 4210 is something very unusual set (I think we won't get a set similar to that in the next 20 years) and because of I don't like the petrol boat inside (no backwalls , nearly no interior )"

aS'Paramedic Unit Set #: 6364 Year Released: 1980 Piece Count: 140 Minifigs: 2 List Price: unknown Well, let me first say that the English name, "Paramedic Unit" is not really a good name for this set'
p16420
aS' The function of a paramedic is to take a patient from an emergent situation, and deliver them to a hospital for treatment, generally an Emergency Room'
p16421
aS' This is a rather small "clinic" that I would imagine is more for family care than an Emergency Room'
p16422
aS" In addition, the car looks more like a doctor/nurse's car rather than an Ambulance or Emergency Response Vehicle"
p16423
aS' I would call this a "Clinic" rather than a Paramedic Unit'

aS' What I like is that this set is small enough to place anywhere in your Lego City or Town'
p16427
aS' Starting with the instructions: Like all the classic town sets, alternate models are pictured, although i never tried building one: I like the little medical bus/van'
p16428
aS' The set includes two minifigs, that include a female Doctore or Nurse, and what I presume is a patient, based on the torsos: I really like the vehicle'
p16429
aS" It's a 4-stud wide two seater: The colors work well and I like the use of the white bar between the seats (and the 1x1 blue plates for lights)"
p16430
aS' Unfortunately, the emblems are stickers'
p16431
aS' Here\'s a shot of the neat little "Clinic": I like the use of the blinds for the exam room'
p16432
aS' It shows that Lego considered patient privacy when making this set'
p16433
aS' The interior includes an exam room, desk, and two blue swivel chairs: And a neat little eye chart: Although the letters L E G O would have made a nice touch'
p16434
aS' Lastly, a picture of the complete set: I must admit that I remember buying this set back in the 80s and I regreted it after taking it home'
p16435
aS' I\'m not sure what I didn\'t like about it (perhaps the "girl" back then), but now I really think it\'s a neat set'
p16436
aS" Well, there's a line of patients waiting to have their eyes checked"
p16437
aS' Comments welcome'
p16438
aS'Thanks a lot for the review, Brickster! I never had the chance to get some classic town sets, but I wish I couldve! I just wonder why Lego cant release sets like this anymore'
p16439
aS'thanks! I own this set'
p16440
aS'! It was a good time as TLG released a lot of little buildings'
p16441
aS' (just look through the 63xx-setnumbers)'
p16442
aS"Paramedic Unit, does not seem to suit well for this set's name"
p16443
aS' It should be named as Clinic, Outpatient Treatment, Family Doctor and etc'
p16444
aS' From what I understand, Parmedic unit, is a stand-alone unit, that is on standby, 24/7, ready for any emergency rescue in LEGO Town'
p16445
aS' Ambulance, with a group of paramedics will be ideal for this kind of situation'
p16446
aS' I love female doctors, especially with that lovely hairpiece! The cruiser, is a neat 4-studs wide design'
p16447
aS' Just love these small car designs back then'
p16448
aS' I wonder what can be used at the back of its boot'
p16449
aS' The clinic is neat'
p16450
aS' Maybe, we can send Holodoc for some medical audit, to make sure that this clinic is up to standard'
p16451
aS' What surprised me the most, is the neat little eye chart'
p16452
aS" You don't see such details in any regular LEGO set"
p16453
aS' The red and white color combination for the building, works well for me'
p16454
aS' Most of the hospital buildings and vehicles, always revolved in red and white'
p16455
aS' I gave this a "4" Thanks you so much, Brickster!'
p16456
aS"I just can't believe someone would rate this set a 1"
p16457
aS' It appears to be a trend among these classic reviews, never with a comment of why'

aS'people giving this "1"? g'
p16465
aS' i\'d give it a "4"'

p16467

p16468
aS' the only problem i always had is the lack of an ambulance'
p16469
aS' AND we got a female doctor! :-)'
p16470
aS'Brickster strikes again with another awesome review! Ah, one of the few hospital related kits lego made'
p16471
aS" Wasn't this the first hospital with modern minifigs? (because I seem to remember seeing an even older hospital online that had the armless, faceless figs)"
p16472
aS" Regardless, this would be great as a little doctor's office in someone's town layout - although the vehicle is a little silly"
p16473
aS' And that eye chart sticker has to be the coolest decal EVER'
p16474
aS' Quote maybe a TFOL'
p16475
aS" Well, it sure isn't me"
p16476
aS" I personally love older kits, even though I'm only a teen"
p16477
aS" I like a lot of the newer sets a bit more than some of the classic stuff, but I have always agreed that the 70's and 80's were an extremely high point in lego's time (even though I don't really own any kits from the period) Edited by Grevious, 19 July 2008 - 05:05 PM"

aS" it's not exactly town plan, but it's above average"
p16483
aS'Thank you for all these reviews, TheBrickster! And: The idea with the polls is a very nice and interesting idea'
p16484
aS' (It will only take a while until I will have commented on all - so please give me some time'
p16485

p16500
aS' These old sets are all very cool'
p16501
aS'Wow! Old thread'
p16502
aS' Just for the record, so long as it is here'
p16503
aS" Paramedic's are advanced Ambulance technicians"
p16504
aS" Unlike standard EMT's they are trained for Advanced Cardiac Life Support"
p16505
aS' They can push drugs, defibrillate, place a breathing tube etc'
p16506
aS' in the 1980\'s when the set was made, it was quite common for Paramedics to respond to calls in "fly cars" or special response units'
p16507
aS' They would join up with Ambulances at the scenes that required their skills'
p16508
aS' If you ever watched the old American TV show "Emergency", Johnny Gage And Squad 51 were one of these response units'
p16509
aS" They were mostly phased out in the 90's in favor of simply putting the Paramedics and ALS gear in the ambulances"

aS'Hello all Eurobricks members and Town Lovers, Today, I will be doing up a review on Hook & Haul Wrecker'
p16511
aS' This name is quite wierd to me'
p16512
aS' I will prefer to call it the regular tow truck'
p16513
aS' This is one of the service and repair vehicle that are always ready 24/7 on stand-by for any emergency towing in our towns'
p16514
aS' Name: Hook & Haul Wrecker Theme: LEGO System / Town Year: 1989 Pieces: 44 Minifigs: 1 Price: USD$6'
p16515
aS'00 An image of a 6660, Hook & Haul Wrecker Let the towing begins Hook & Haul Wrecker is the typical 4-studs wide vehicle that takes care of broken vehicles that is left stranded on the roads'
p16516
aS' This tow truck is pretty useful'
p16517
aS' As you can see, current City sets hardly have any tow trucks available to tow new cars design'
p16518
aS' This tow truck is catered for 4-studs vehicles for Classic Town'
p16519
aS' Can you imagine yourself this truck towing a Speed Racer car? I think it looks really out of proportion'
p16520
aS' In addition, the mini-fig which is included in this set has the regular truck print on its torso'
p16521
aS' I am very sure they must be a fan club for "Trucks"'
p16522
aS' Otherwise, they should really need a change of clothes'
p16523
aS' Nevertheless, in my honest opnion'
p16524
aS' I really love this torso very much'
p16525
aS' Somehow, it makes them look tough even though their face looks very friendly'
p16526
aS' Side View This vehicle has a combination of two primary colors which is white and red'
p16527
aS' This color combination looks very good'
p16528
aS' You cannot mistook it for an ambulance since they made use of this two colors too, in most Emergency vehicles'
p16529
aS' This is my guess, I supposed the designer will have tow truck concept as a form of emergency and considered red and white as its combinations'
p16530
aS' This vehicle set-up has the typical sun-screen on the top of the vehicle frame'
p16531
aS' However, this baby has more unique features installed in it'
p16532
aS' These are the source of its brutal strength All-Terrain Vehicle??? This tow truck equipped with the best wheels'
p16533
aS' In fact, these wheels offer suspension on the roads'
p16534
aS' Even when its travelling uphill, the truck will move accordingly with its tyres'
p16535
aS' When you act pressure on the top of the vehicle, it will either be shifted leftwards or rightwards'
p16536
aS' Close-up of these unique tyres Take a careful look'
p16537
aS' These wheels have springs installed in it'
p16538
aS' That is the magic of these vehicle and is defintely suited to run on any rough roads with least problems'
p16539
aS' If any EB Members know which other vehicles has this unique features, please highlight it to me'
p16540
aS' Because, if I remembered correctly'
p16541
aS' I only remember seeing this pair of tyres in this great set'
p16542
aS' He is ready for some serious towing'
p16543
aS' The driver had finished hook up the pizza van on its back'
p16544
aS" It's pretty simple"
p16545
aS' You just have to lift the back of the vehicle and placed it onto the hook'
p16546
aS' Presto, the van is ready to go'
p16547
aS' This vehicle provides so much fun'
p16548
aS' You can really tow any 4-studs vehicle in your town'
p16549
aS' And, here we go! To the service station'

aS'Cool review! I\'ve always loved these "hard" looking tyres, i never understood why they don\'t make them anymore'
p16562
aS' They looked way more off-roadish'
p16563
aS"This is one of my favorite town vehicles from the old time, and for one specific reason: The truck is on the guys shirt! It didn't matter that the color was wrong, or the hook was missing"
p16564
aS' I thought it was awesome beyond imagination'
p16565
aS' for some reason Thanks for the review Whitefang'
p16566
aS'i rate this a 5! one of my last sets before my dark age'
p16567
aS' suspension wheels are superb and are rare! the minifig, although smiling, really looks tough because of the tanktop'
p16568
aS' oh did i say im giving it a 5?'
p16569
aS'4 stars'
p16570
aS' the suspension wheel holder totally rocks'
p16571
aS' yeah'
p16572
aS' though the Slope Brick 45 2x3 x 1 1/3 Double disappoints me a little'
p16573
aS' btw: the 6350 Pizza To Go Van looks soooo cute! thanks for the review! (and keeeeep them coming'

aS' There are many outstanding reviews from Brickster as well, especially those classic vintage LEGO sets, that I had never seen before, except browsing it in Brickset'

aS'Another great review, Whitefang'
p16586
aS" This is a wonderful 80's vehicle - and I think it might be one of the first - if not THE first - that had the spring suspension system"
p16587

p16591
aS' Can you imagine yourself this truck towing a Speed Racer car? I think it looks really out of proportion'
p16592
aS' Firstly, Speed Racer cars are out of scale even with City vehicles'
p16593
aS' Also, I have hope that in the next few years we will get more Octan sets to go with the wonderful gas station - and I suspect that a 6-wide tow truck will be at the top of the list'

p16597
aS' Has it ever been used in any other sets?'
p16598
aS"Indeed they have; they've appeared in 15 different sets, in total"
p16599
aS' They also have an identical width with the wide 2x2 wheels holder which is used on cars today'
p16600
aS" They are still excellent today, since retrofitting these suspension parts onto today's off-roader trucks won't give them weird proportions or any problems, and it looks perfect"
p16601
aS" Plus they are useful if you're lazy and don't feel like constructing the pin-suspension used in the early 90's for truck-trailers, altough stability probably will suffer"
p16602
aS'4/5'
p16603
aS" I've had this set since I was young"
p16604
aS' Never understood why a tow truck needed to be an off-roader; maybe it was used to tow the other off-road vehicles'
p16605
aS' The suspension made the truck too tall to tow some cars, so I often took the hook out and use the truck as just an great off-road truck like 6672 (which also had the suspension wheels)'
p16606
aS" Other tow truck sets better filled their roles better, but that doesn't diminish this set at all"
p16607
aS' WhiteFang, on Jul 18 2008, 09:19 AM, said: I think it looks really out of proportion'
p16608
aS' No, for 25-odd years this vehicle was perfectly proportioned with all others in the town/city line'
p16609
aS" It's all these new 6 and 8 and 20 wide vehicles that are ignoring convention and making it look out of proportion"
p16610
aS' Granted speed racer sets are more of their own line, but 6660 is smaller than most of the cars produced in the last few years'
p16611
aS"Superb review of a great set!This is one of my favourite classic sets becouse of all these functions(engine,suspension)and it's great design with less than 100 pieces used( only 52 )!Congratulations for the review!I think that it's an outstanding set and surely worth 5 stars"
p16612
aS'Cheers for taking the time to put together this review, Whitefang'
p16613
aS' Considering the year of release of this set, I love it'
p16614
aS' Would still fit in nicely in any city'
p16615
aS'Three cheers to Classic Town trucks! It felt nostalgic to see this appearing at the surface after seven years'

p16622
aS' It has very nice colors, lots of great details, and a high level of playability'
p16623
aS' Starting with the instructions: The backside with a great picture of the complete set: The set includes three minifigs including two gas station attendants and my favorite, the Urban Cowboy: One of the best things about this set is that it includes not one, but two very detailed 4-stud wide vehicles'
p16624
aS' Here\'s a picture of the red one which is a two-seater: The car has two working doors, a hood that opens, and a little holed brick on the other side for pretending to "fill \'er up"'
p16625
aS" Here's another image at an angle: Isn't she a nice set of wheels! Here's the yellow car"
p16626
aS" I always liked this one better, perhaps it was the color with the black pieces in the back, although it is a one-seater: The set includes four fuel pumps that are numbered (with decals) and included a string as the hose: Here's a little accessory rack for oil and tools: And another rack for tires: The set had a nice Exxon logo on three 1x6 bricks: A large jack allows the cars to be lifted high into the air for tire and under engine repairs: I love the office with its large 5x6 window"

aS" I also don't get why people complain about the stickers so much - because even older kits often had a lot"

aS" Maybe it's because I build this set by myself by ordering all parts and buildinginstruction"
p16670
aS' And I made one extra tanktransporter : Excellent tankers Panda'
p16671
aS' These make great additions to the station'
p16672
aS'Brickster You need your own sticky review section, I love looking at all of these old sets, As I have said before you take me back to a much simpler time'
p16673
aS' Thank You And on to the set'
p16674
aS" I love this gas station Lego really needs to look to it's past on some of these sets for the time the level of detail is great"
p16675
aS' I wish I still had this one in one piece as well'
p16676
aS"Brickster, once again, this is another excellent Gas Station, awaiting to be in the limelight! I don't understand why I always loved these Classic Gas station such as Shell, Exxon and Octan"
p16677
aS' They just look so lovely'
p16678
aS' No City or Town could ever survive without these important key installations around, to pump gas/petroleum for all vehicles, that depend it for fuel consumption'
p16679
aS' As always, all Gas Station will always inculde a road plate, and I am glad I am still seeing roads included in such sets, such as the recent 7993, Service Station'
p16680
aS" However, Town Plan's Gas Station, did not include a baseplate though"
p16681
aS' Nevertheless, let me continue with this review'
p16682
aS' 3 Lovely mini-figs, included in this set'
p16683
aS" It's not common to see Exxon torsos these days"
p16684
aS' I just love that lady staff very much, especially with its classic hairdo'
p16685
aS' 4-studs car just simply rocks, with such fabulous simple design'
p16686
aS' Furthermore, it gave you 2 cars instead of one'
p16687
aS" What more can you ask? You don't see TLG giving more cars in recent sets these days"
p16688
aS' What surprise me about this cars, is the ability of opening the front engine column'
p16689
aS' I remembered vividly that only trucks or massive vehicles, does have this playing feature'
p16690
aS" Nevertheless, it's an excellent addition"
p16691
aS" For a 1980 Gas Station set, this is a perfect set, even when it's going to fit into my current Town buildings"
p16692
aS" I am sure, it won't have a hard time to match with the rest of the facade"
p16693
aS' I can use this gas station and stationed it near the country side'
p16694
aS' This set is so hard to resist, with such elegant design of its fuel pump'
p16695
aS' There are a total of 4 pumping stations'
p16696
aS" The vehicles won't be fighting against each other, for slots then"
p16697
aS' The reparing area is very nice, it will be even better if it include a shelter on top of it'
p16698
aS' The office is simple and nice'
p16699
aS' I had never expect an office to exist in Gas Station'
p16700
aS' Most of the time, there are groceries stores, for the consumers to get off, buy off some stores and load it in the car'
p16701
aS' No major complains from me'
p16702
aS' I am not trying to be selection bias'
p16703
aS' I had demostrated key points which is good enough to justify my score'
p16704
aS' And, I gave it a "5"'
p16705
aS' Outstanding Classic Gas Station set'
p16706
aS"Again great topic/poll, TheBrickster! I gave this set a 3: Which is on the one hand negative is that it's really old-fashioned for today "
p16707
aS' Which is on the other hand positive is that it includes very nice and authentic details (like e'
p16708
aS' g'
p16709
aS' doors in the cars ) which is imo for that time a feat '

p16769
aS' They are all the same, however'
p16770
aS' See those two rubber parts? Those keep it in place when on surfaces like glass'
p16771
aS' Next come the large part of the legs'

Anyway, I don't normally like it when people make a topic to say they'll review a set soon, but I'll let you off since this is one of the few Mars Mission sets I really like, and I'm glad to know somebody has the set and will be reviewing it"

aS' Man, this baby is flawless'
p16812
aS" There are so many indications that the designers took care in designing this kit - like the space for the pilot's backpack, the compartment for the mini flier, the sturdy leg design - etc etc etc"

p16889
aS'0 Hours And my favorite stickers of the set'
p16890
aS"Nice review! I don't mind the set, but, at the same time, I'm not particularly fond of it"
p16891
aS"I don't like Mars Mission sets but this one is just SPECTACULAR! It is beautiful! I must have this set, even if it means selling my kidney! I only have one Mars Mission set, the ETX Alien Mothership Assault, which is okay"
p16892
aS' But this set blows my mind! Two thumbs up!'

aS'Looks like a great set, i may consider making this the first mars mission set i buy'

p16895
aS' But Quote Lol, thanks'
p16896
aS' I just wanted to claim my place for the review'
p16897
aS" Personally i don't think you had a place to claim"
p16898
aS' Somebody else could have also gotten this set and had a proper review ready before yours but felt it was wrong to post because you had posted a placeholder ( ClubNinja in this case)'
p16899
aS' I think placeholders should be banned and if you are not ready to post a full review you should not post anything'
p16900
aS' Simple really'
p16901
aS' Either that or what is the policy on here regarding more than one review of a set being posted - then you could have both posted reviews and it wont really matter i guess'
p16902
aS' Just my 2 cents worth Thanks for the review though'
p16903
aS"Today i'm gonna review the bigger of the 2 castles from the fright knigh theme"
p16904
aS' I got this one last week at a pretty fair prive at ebay, new and still sealed'
p16905
aS' I love opening boxes that had been lying arounf for years and being the first to build an old set'
p16906
aS" Since i know this castle theme is not liked so much by the general public, i'll try here and change their minds, cause i really think this is a great set"
p16907
aS" This time i have to say my pictures turned out pretty amazing, even if i am still using just my cellphone cam, but i'm really pleased now with the quality"
p16908
aS' Here we go! Set Nr'
p16909
aS': 6097 Name: Night Lord\'s Castle Number of minifigs: 7 Number of pieces: 598 Release Year: 1997 Let\'s start with a few box & instructions pictures: The inside od the box, with a few alternate models: The back, with another possibility how to assemble the 3 main parts: Instructions: Next, the 6 minifigs, starting with the witch on her black dragon: All 5 figures of the fright section: And the poor royal knight: We go on with the set itself, first a general overview (it\'s really high!): On the "first floor" there\'s a trap with which you can drop stones or other things down on unliked guests, the pot comes originally from fabuland i think, i love this thing: In the same floor there is a second trap, if you pull the bar, the door opens: We move on to the tower itself (did i mention it\'s really high?), on the ground level there\'s the place for the witch to do her spells: The wall is a secret door, which reveals a skeleton when turned over: on the next level there is this little thingy, first it only seems like a barrel'
p16910
aS"but when you pull the two 1x4 tiles on the back, a skull is being revealed, scary, huh : I don't really understand what this is for but i assume it's a telescope to watch and observate the dragons, i do find that a bit senseless since there haven't been telescopes in medieval times (or have there been): The back of the tower with the prison and the room for the treasure chest: The prison opened"
p16911
aS" It's secured with a chain, which i like very much cause you really can lock it with that: Treasure chest: From the highest peak we now go down to the very ground level, at the back of the castle there is another secret wall-door, flanked by two shields: At the back half of the inside there is the throne hall for the Bat Lord, with a nice warm fireplace in the back (this is, where the secret door is placed): The second half is pretty empty, except for these two baskets"
p16912
aS" i don't know exactly what they are for, but i ike the idea for using them as water places for the horses: One thing that might be a bit stupid is that 2 of the 4 side entrances do not have doors, so they are open and a guard would have to stand there the whole day"
p16913
aS" You can see it in his face he isn't very happy with that : That was my last review of the sets i got the last weeks, but i'm looking forward to make much more in the future"
p16914
aS" Overall this is a pretty good set, i don't know any other one with so much details and playability"
p16915
aS' The minus point is, as already said, that it is too open on the sides, but that can be solved easily with a bit of modding'
p16916
aS" Also i must say, this set isn't that much juniorized as many might have thought, though the design is a bit unconventional, but exactly that's what i like most about it"
p16917
aS" All in all it gets a 9/10 for me hope you enjoyed the reading and the pictures, can't wait to see your response"
p16918
aS" Edit: Oops, i forgot to put one figure of the fright knight faction on the photo, but it's the one in the last picture"

aS'Nice review, good close-ups and a good, unconventional choice of a set'
p16921
aS" As for the set itself, it has it's pros and cons in my eyes"
p16922
aS' I like all the minifigs, but especially the witch'
p16923
aS' The Fright Knights are probably the closest you can get for an evil human Castle faction'
p16924
aS' As for the building itself, on the other hand I like the fact that it can be modified, but some of the design choices are just stupid'
p16925
aS' The holes in the wall, the one huge tower (as opposed to several smaller ones), the huge empty space in the center, and the excessive usage of bright yellow'
p16926
aS" I guess for a smaller kid the play value is great, it's easily accessible and it looks sturdy enough, but to an AFOL, it's not much else than a source for bricks and figs, in my opinion"
p16927
aS' Oh, and they did have telescopes in the medieval times (the witch most probably uses it for astrology)'
p16928
aS" And even if they didn't, we're talking about a castle with a dragon and a wicked witch in it, so it's not exactly a good example of accurate history"
p16929
aS"Sweet review, metalandi! This set always looked a bit too busy for my liking, I guess I just didn't expect to see a set so tall"
p16930
aS' After seeing your review though, it is growing on me'
p16931
aS" I like all the play features, and at the very least it's a great parts pack"
p16932
aS" Two things I'm confused about though"
p16933
aS" In this pic, is that dragon being used as a swing set? And I don't get why the area where the witch casts her spells on the second floor is green"
p16934
aS' Green in Castle means grass (or Forestmen'
p16935
aS' ), and having grass on the second floor of a building is just weird'
p16936
aS" I understand that it's modular and thus it would make sense if it were placed on the ground, but dark grey would make just as much sense, and would look much better than the green there IMO"
p16937
aS" Anyway, I'm just fussy"
p16938
aS' Thanks again for the cool review, will we be seeing any more? ~Peace'
p16939
aS'I love the reviews of older sets that I never had'
p16940
aS' Also, tiny thing, but you said it has 7 minifigs, but the group shots only include 6'
p16941
aS" The last guy isn't shown until the very end"
p16942
aS'@iamded: yes it seems the dragon is used as such in the picture of the alternate model, but i guess bad and evil knights also wanna have some fun sometimes you are right with the green plate on the second floor, it does look a bit disturbing'
p16943
aS' but that can'
p16944
aS'I thoroughly enjoyed your review Metalandi, thank you especially for taking photos of all the contraptions and detailing exactly how they work'
p16945
aS' As a member of classic-castle, the census always seemed to be that fright knights were a class 4/10 or 6/10 but as Sandy stated above, it is one of the closest you can get to an evil faction'
p16946
aS" By today's standards, the contraptions seen here are much much more sophisticated and well thought out and are definitely missing in 2007's King's Castle Siege"
p16947
aS" I enjoy the design of this castle much more even if the towers are taller simply because the design in the King's Castle Siege left builders with an empty space right in the courtyard without even a base plate! AND it's nearly impossible to get your hands in and play in the enclosed space (why would anyone unless you're simply posing figs, and even that was difficult)"
p16948
aS" This Castle instead, had a variety of trap doors and surprises, so despite the varied colors used here, it's not that hard to realize that the designers for this Castle really took time to think things out and tried to make the Castle enjoyable for the children that will play with it whereas our 2007 Castle was strictly built to give kids the impression of an enormous magnificant Castle with little to nothing inside"
p16949
aS" It's like comparing beauty (2007) to brains (this castle)"

aS" You won't be off 'till tomorrow"

aS" That's still a day away! There's still time! No, but still, I'll be looking forward to the review when you get back! ~Peace"

aS'Very nice of a very nice set'

aS' The revolving fireplace - I wonder what movie that could possibly be from?'
p16956
aS'I have this set, and ilike it! 6097 have many usefull parts! Greate Review!'
p16957
aS'Metalandi, thanks for doing this Fright Knights review, by opening up a MISB set which you have bought recently'
p16958
aS' I am very sure the feeling is very nice, especially touching the bricks which is preserved for 11 years sealed in bags'
p16959
aS' I am quite fond of the Fright Knights theme'
p16960
aS' Unfortunately, this theme was released during my dark age'
p16961
aS' I never really bought sets from Fright Knights'
p16962
aS' Instead, I bought plenty of minifigs to build an army'
p16963
aS' If I could turn back time or find another MISB set with a reasonable price, I am very sure I will get it'
p16964
aS' My soldiers need a castle to stay in'

aS"I read this review not long after you posted it, but I'm not sure why I didn't comment"
p16968
aS' If Dragonator is the one to post everytime he sees a dragon related topic, I would be the one to post if I see a Fright Knights topic'
p16969
aS" Fright Knights is one of my favourite Lego themes, and this review is really good! I got both of the castles in the theme and loved them, and your review presents Basil the Batlord's castle well"
p16970
aS" I too thought it was a bit weird that there is a green base when it could be grey, but I guess it's a useful piece to use in other things"
p16971
aS' Fright Knights On!'
p16972
aS'Ah this brings back memories, i have this set and i loved the playabilaty factor opposing to older castle sets i have! In medieval times there actually were primitive telescopes, you can read about it here'
p16973
aS' Thanks for this review, great storie, great pics!'
p16974
aS'Wow, what a cool castle and set in general! I had no idea that this set existed (long dark ages) Thanks to you metalandi for such a great review! The figures look really nice and the set is full of lots of little trinkets , details, traps etc! I have already had a look on ebay for this set'

aS' I got this set new and unopened I know, pretty good deal!'
p16994
aS'Good review - the photo from above shows off the scale of the castle much better than the box photo'
p16995
aS' I was one of those who always thought this set looked lame, ever since first seeing it in the catalogue'
p16996
aS' A couple of my siblings had smaller Bat Lord/Fright Knight sets and enjoyed the accessories and style of the minifigs etc'
p16997
aS' So last year having not only ended my dark ages, but done so for some of the rest of my family, I got this set off ebay for my sister for Christmas'
p16998
aS' I of course had to build it to make sure all parts were there before leaving ebay feedback and ending the transaction'
p16999
aS' First impressions were of how much brick there was to the set, as well as really useful large structural elements'
p17000
aS" And to be honest, while perhaps a bit childish, there's no doubt the style of the minifigs is kinda cute and useful for customs"
p17001
aS' It was really enjoyable building this set, and the scale is impressive when built, empty spaces notwithstanding (but hey, Lego has always had buildings with no back, etc'
p17002
aS' - just use your imagination and enjoy the access to playspace offered)'
p17003
aS' The traps etc'
p17004
aS' are neat and more like the kind of "action features" modern sets come with (I for one am in favour of these, for kids they are fun and I think for builders they give ideas cause they are often done with minimal parts or impact on the set design)'
p17005
aS' Anyways, needless to say my sister loved the set'
p17006
aS" Indeed she's currently rebuilding it for the second time"
p17007
aS' If I see it as cheap again, I will pick up one for myself'
p17008
aS' I got the first one at 30 incl postage I believe'
p17009
aS'Ahh'
p17010
aS' I remember how badly I wanted that set when it was new'
p17011
aS' oh well'
p17012
aS' Definitely one of the most original castles, if not THE most'
p17013
aS' I actually liked how the 1st floor was made into a throne room'
p17014
aS' The tower looks pretty impressive, too'
p17015
aS' Of course, the castle has a flagrant flaw -- the walls on the sides are open'
p17016
aS' I also think it lacks in the minifig count, though that is understandable for a castle with a dragon'
p17017
aS' Quote The Fright Knights are probably the closest you can get for an evil human Castle faction'
p17018
aS' Totally agreed'
p17019
aS'Quite the topic bump, but dang, what a cool set, and so tall'
p17020
aS" This is the kind of sets I had as a kid, but I don't remember this one"
p17021
aS" I'm jealous"
p17022
ag6453
aS'I got a couple of the small sets from this line when it came out'
p17023
aS' Recently, I acquired several more from Bricklink because I just really love the way they look'
p17024
aS' This theme really had good intentions, but the execution was flawed'
p17025
aS' I hope one day Lego returns to a darker tone, but maybe next time it could be more Castlevania inspired'
p17026
aS' That would really turn some heads! Plus, vampires and gothic aesthetics are really popular now'
p17027
aS' It will probably have run its course by the time Lego would be able to develop a theme around them, though'
p17028
aS'Fire Station Set #: 6382 Year Released: 1980/1981 Piece Count: 368 Minifigs: 4 List Price: approx'
p17029
aS" $20 Lego's third fire station was this little gem, 6382"
p17030
aS' The set offered new design elements not previously offered in previous sets'
p17031
aS' What really stands out for me is 1x3 car doors and torsos with printed designs'
p17032
aS' A decal was used for the large sign on the building and the #1 on the hood of one of the vehicles'
p17033
aS' I think this was also the first set to offer the sliding garage mechanism, a feature that added a great amount of realism and playability'
p17034
aS' The set also included two blue doors and the new fire hose with pre-connected faucet/spicket'
p17035
aS' Getting on to the pictures'
p17036
aS' I saved the cover of the box for this set but lost the instructions over the years'
p17037
aS' I was able to download some instructions from the web'
p17038
aS" Here's a shot of the box cover: And the back of the box: The set includes four figs, three of which are fireman, and a lady who can serve as a dispatcher"
p17039
aS' As mentioned above, the torsos are printed on: My favorite of the two vehicles included, I love the design of Fire Engine #1: I always loved the fire hoses included in this set'
p17040
aS' No string to have to tie or freyed ends: Engine #2 is this much larger engine with ladder'
p17041
aS' I like how it contains an oxygen tank and fire axe: On the other side of the engine are two shutter doors that reveal the hose and ladder controls'
p17042
aS' These are stickers: The ladder is much wider than previous Lego ladders and extends a good length: I like the baseplate of this set which has the numbers ONE and TWO marking each garage: The building is simple but has a nice design'
p17043
aS' I love the sliding garage doors: NOTE: Notice the two windows of the 2nd floor'
p17044
aS' The actual set should have blinds on these windows'
p17045
aS" I've lost one of the stickered windows, so placed the single blinded window on the 1st floor"
p17046
aS' Each of the two sides of the garages are the same'
p17047
aS" Here's a shot of the right side: On the first floor is the dispatch area and a classic blue Space computer: The 2nd floor has a bed and a chair: Here's a shot of the entire backside: And lastly, a shot of the entire station: This set is one of my favorite fire stations that offers a great amount of playability"
p17048
aS' Hope you enjoyed the review'
p17049
aS'This is a great set and a great review - Thanks for doing these! I remember my brother getting this set (I got the police station 6384 on the same day)'

p17121
aS' I love the use of the red and yellow colors: The front opens to allow your fireman to quickly climb in: In the back are two round yellow 2x2 bricks for the water supply and a hose connected on each side'

aS' loooooved the chopper, but never got it'
p17130

p17132
aS"A nice little model with some neat features for it's age plus the all-yime classic fireman as a bonus"
p17133
aS' However, this design of chopper (the police station around the same time was the same design) I think dated very quickly'
p17134
aS' While is was good to use the hinged car roof - which was relatively new at the time - together with the inverted screen it was superceded very quickly by designs that stood the test of time far better (for example 6657)'
p17135
aS" Also, I don't think I could everbuy a Lego fire helicopter because it is not something we have in the UK/Eire"

aS' It\'s primary color "red" is used in all fire emergency department and vehicles'
p17153
aS' In case of any emergency, this snorkel squad will be activated and arrived at the scene as soon as possible'
p17154
aS' No time to waste! Personally, this is the best fire engine that I had ever seen'
p17155
aS' Meet the Fire Fighters It comes with two brave fire fighters'
p17156
aS' Both of them wear the standard fire fighter outfit that is present in almost all Fire Station sets in Classic Town'
p17157
aS' The torso is very nice and formal, and looks real impressive onto them'
p17158
aS' I love the buttons on them'
p17159
aS' Furthermore, these white helmets are a symbol to the world of Fire Fighting'
p17160
aS' These are the people whom save lives by risking their own lives in dangerous situations'
p17161
aS' Water Hose compartment The water hose is a string that is stored in the front'
p17162
aS' It can be rolled out, and the fire fighters are able to use it without much difficulty'
p17163
aS' They will just pull out the hose and spray onto the fire'
p17164
aS' The next picture, shows a much clearer look in its interior'
p17165
aS' In addition, the fire logo that is on the compartment, is actually printed'
p17166
aS" Yes, it's not a sticker, and that is great news for us! Interesting features These clamps on both sides, is supposed to stablise the fire engine when the ladder is heading upwards"
p17167
aS' It is a simple mechanism, which illustrate clearly what it does'
p17168
aS' This feature is recently seen in Construction vehicle such as the Mobile Crane'
p17169
aS' Of course, it is not a complicated feature'
p17170
aS' It just made use of three quite common white parts'
p17171
aS' Swivel Mechanism These swivel mechanism, in my opnion are very fun to play with'
p17172
aS' These connectors on the front and the back, enable the long fire engine, to make sharp turns on any junctions, arriving at the scene fast enough'
p17173
aS' This is not a fire engine that only travel straight roads'
p17174
aS' Try it onto your base plates, and you will be surprised, how well it can turn'
p17175
aS' Best Playable mechanism in 6358 The driver will be activating the ladder at the back of the vehicle'
p17176
aS' In order, to adjust the height and making sure that the ladder do not fall short, the tiles on the plates are acting like a stoppage'
p17177
aS' The ladder are able to rotate 360 degree without much problem, if you removed the driver out of the control panel'
p17178
aS' It goes up as tall as 30cm! Look at that amazing height'
p17179
aS' Too bad, I have not constructed my Cafe Corner yet'
p17180
aS' Otherwise, I can give you a better feel of how amazing this baby can go'
p17181
aS' I used the old road baseplate as a guide, and roughly it can goes as tall as 30 to 35cm'
p17182
aS' Look at the black hinges below'
p17183
aS' By shifting it to the last, that was the maximum height it can move'
p17184
aS' This is a very good way to adjust the height'
p17185
aS' Oh, and I forget to mention that there are 2 storage compartments for the fighters to place their equipments behind'
p17186
aS' Quite easy to access'
p17187
aS" No doors? Apart from the standard roof top on the driver's seat, there is no doors present at both side"
p17188
aS' I am quite sad to see that there are no doors'
p17189
aS' Maybe, these fighters are supposed to jump off the seat, instead of opening the doors? Well, I guess this is the only major flaws that I had found in this set'
p17190

p17209
aS" I'm quiet sure it's my envy because until now I want to believe that the 6340 is better"
p17210
aS' My reasons were these: I own the 6340 (and on the instructions of the 6358 stood "LEGOLAND" which I thought of as old'
p17211
aS') But this review induced me to get over this humiliation from my childhood ( ) and check ebay for the 6358'

p17406
aS'This sounds very similar to the first one'
p17407
aS" I'm glad I'm saving this one till later in my purchasing cycle"
p17408
aS' All the SW walkers have a skeletal fram with almost nothing inside'
p17409
aS" It's very disappointing, but I guess filling them in would up the piece count considerably"
p17410
aS' Does this beast have any good handholds for picking it up? I seem to recall a handle or something coming out of the top in the pre-release pics'
p17411
aS"So basically, you cited as faults what everybody had been complaining about since the first information of the set arrived? Skeletal interior and lack of clones? Although I didn't realize it didn't have numbered backs"
p17412
aS' That really is just ridiculous'
p17413
aS' LEGO finally comes up with a very intelligent solution to the frustration seen when building large sets, but then they neglect to implement it'
p17414
aS' WTF? Lame'
p17415
aS' Still, this may be the only Clone Wars set I buy besides the exclusives'
p17416
aS' The exterior, which IMO is the only part that matters, looks so fantastic'
p17417
aS" I don't care about clones, I have enough of those already"
p17418
aS" And at 90$ it's still a better buy than the RGS"
p17419
aS' The Torrent is cool but not as cool as the Fighter Tank or DGS imo'
p17420
aS' Awesome in-construction pics'
p17421
aS'Thanks for the reivew'
p17422
aS" Could you post a few pics of the AT-TE in all it's glory? KimT"
p17423
aS'Just picked this set up, and just took a break from building to go to Football Practice'
p17424
aS' I have just finished building all of the legs, and so far it looks like it is going to be a great set'
p17425
aS' I would have like it if more clones were included, but whatever'
p17426
aS' I find it interesting how many clone accessories they give you'
p17427
aS" I don't like it only because I can't decide what I want to use"
p17428
aS' I find it interesting that at lease 2 people are missing pieces'
p17429
aS' I have had multiple times where I thought I was missing pieces, only to find that they were in the bag somewhere'
p17430
aS" Other than the fact that there is a lack of minifigures, I love this set and can't wait to finish it later tonight"
p17431
aS' Edited by SWMAN, 04 August 2008 - 08:33 PM'
p17432
aS"I just got this set Sunday, and it's so HUGE that I can't put it anywhere"
p17433
aS" It is pretty sturdy and heavy, that's where the handle comes in"
p17434
aS" I'm pissed that you only get 2 clones"
p17435
aS' Rex has to fight on the ground while you need more clones to man the guns/cockpit'
p17436
aS' The legs were the most annoying and time consuming part of the build'
p17437
aS' And yea I agree, that if TLG had made numbered bags, it would have taken only 2 hours rather than 4'
p17438
aS' Edited by iH Master 13uilder17, 14 October 2008 - 11:38 PM'
p17439
aS'I bought this a few weeks ago and absolutely loved making it'
p17440
aS" It's amazing how the paneling comes together to make such a tight fit, but can easily open up"
p17441
aS" The legs could have been a bit more poseable, and the guns don't launch easily unless you push hard and fast"
p17442
aS" I'd like the firing mechanism to launch more smoothly"
p17443
aS' But it looks absolutely amazing'
p17444
aS" About price, it was 13,000 where I am, but I'm used to Lego being expensive in Japan, so it was good value"
p17445
aS'Funny minifig actions there'
p17446
aS' I do love the AT-TE, a definite buy for walker fans'
p17447
aS"Probably my most wanted set(RGS is too much), but this seems a 'lil overpriced, I mean $90 for a skeleton? II'll wait fr it to go on sale(which i doubt it will)"

p17475
aS" They've planned this for quite a while"
p17476

aS'7676: Republic Attack Gunship Number of Pieces: 1034 Number of Minifigs: 5 Price: 119'
p17479
aS'99 USD Brickset Hey everyone, I just got the RGS yesterday at TRU after I came home from camp'
p17480
aS" I saw all of the topics that I missed, and noticed a mini-review and a review with one pic, so I thought I'd make a huge, shiny new review that has lots of pictures and all of the requirements of KimT's index"
p17481
aS' NOTE: I did not apply any stickers to it, as a personal liking'
p17482
aS' So, lets start by looking at the box: A shiny, clean, and futuristic box, quite different from the other Star Wars box designs before this'
p17483
aS' There was so much Clone Wars merchandise with this font and design in the huge display at the front of my local Toys r Us store, and not just LEGO'
p17484
aS' It so beautiful, with the white and sky blue'
p17485
aS' anyways, for some reason, the boxes of the new Clone Wars sets seemed more shiny than usual'
p17486
aS" Maybe it's because they were just shipped, but once you pick up the boxes, they will feel really good in your hands, despite the fact that only about half of the space in the boxes are used"
p17487
aS' The back of the box: The back shows all of the main features of the set, plus pictures of the three other Clone Wars sets meant to be released alongside this one (although I did spot the Twilight and Homing Spider Droid, which were supposed to be released in September or October)'
p17488
aS' So, on to the Gunship: Built straight from the bags'
p17489
aS' It took me about 4 1/2 hours, with breaks'
p17490
aS' It has an overall great design, but somewhat fragile, especially when building it'
p17491
aS' The cockpits always fall apart when opened, as well as the bubbles on the wings (which I will get into more later)'
p17492
aS' The color scheme is very well done'
p17493
aS" You can always find the piece you're looking for thanks to the color diversity: Red, Dark Red, Lime Green (ooh!), Blue, Black, Tan, Light Bley, Dark Grey, Yellow and White"
p17494
aS' Also, split down the middle vertically, the ship is almost all symmetrical'
p17495
aS' Front: Side: Now, lets start with the many features that this set is hiding'
p17496
aS' The front has lots of lime green, a rare color'
p17497
aS' But more importantly: '
p17498
aS'a rotating gun is found on each side'
p17499
aS' They rotate in a pretty wide range, although fragile'
p17500
aS' Cockpits: There are two main cockpits, right next to each other'
p17501
aS' Not very detailed, and are the same'
p17502
aS' And for some reason, the whole cockpit element flips up to reveal: '
p17503
aS'nothing'
p17504
aS' Just the skeleton of the ship'
p17505
aS' Probe droid storage: Above the cockpit lies a plate that can be flipped up to reveal a storage area that holds: Two of these probe droids'
p17506
aS" At least, that's what I think they are"
p17507
aS' Hull: In this pic, two features are hidden'
p17508
aS' Mobile Command Center: The first of the two is a Mobile Command Center, but essentially just a hover chair'
p17509
aS' It is found by flipping up the two panels on either side of the hull'
p17510
aS' Bacta Tank: The second is the bacta tank found by just sliding it out of the storage area behind the MCC'
p17511
aS' One half of the tank opens: '
p17512
aS'so a minifigure can go inside and heal his/her wounds obtained in battle'
p17513
aS' Cargo hold: Now, this is probably the main feature for this set'
p17514
aS' The two sliding doors (two on each side) slide open thanks to a clever Technic mechanism'
p17515
aS' Not much in here, just a gun holder and a place where the passengers wait to be dropped off in battle'
p17516
aS' Speeder Bike: I guess you guys saw it, the speeder bike'
p17517
aS' It is found by opening the rear flap'
p17518
aS' The bike is very cleverly designed by using a brown trike body'
p17519
aS" It's only a few centimeters shorter than the bike found in the Clone Battle Pack"
p17520
aS' Rear gun: Just a gun similar to the front ones'
p17521
aS' Engines: Huge engines (or are they cannons?) that are really fun to build'
p17522
aS' They really give that cartoon feel to this set'
p17523
aS' Missiles: In between the engines are two sets of four flick-fire missiles'
p17524
aS' Bubble cockpits: There is one bubble cockpit on each wing that supposedly control the turrets at the front'
p17525
aS' Very fragile'
p17526
aS' Storage containers: Two storage containers on each side hold the clone accessories'
p17527
aS" But, I wouldn't recommend putting them in there, because the antennae can fall out, or you might forget about them"
p17528
aS' Sticker Sheet: The Dreaded Sticker Sheet (DSS) has all of the stickers you need for this set'
p17529
aS' Unfortunately, mine was crunched up'
p17530
aS" I don't like stickers much anyways, but I might still apply some"
p17531
aS" Note the Republic symbol stickers, why couldn't TLG just use that printed piece from a few years back? Also, you get to choose between a bird-rat thing or a sleeping Twi'elk as your hull decal"
p17532
aS" What they're for, I don't know, looks like the movie or show will explain it though"
p17533
aS' Minifigs: Finally, the five minifigs of this set'
p17534
aS' They are all great figs, including: Commander Cody: Amazing, especially with the gear'
p17535
aS' The orange is nice, but I thought he was yellow'
p17536
aS' Clone Trooper: Again, amazing'
p17537
aS' The gear is great, and the new helmet and torso are great! All of the clones in the Clone Wars line have the same heads'
p17538
aS' Also, you can see the flesh beneath the helmet'
p17539
aS' Asaaj Ventress: Not so happy about this one'
p17540
aS' The torso and dark blue legs are cool, but the dress is pretty ugly'
p17541
aS' The head is alright, but could do without the cartoon-y face (yeah I know, its from a cartoon)'
p17542
aS' Also has purple markings on back of head'
p17543
aS' Obi-Wan Kenobi: Pretty cool, besides the face'
p17544
aS' Cool hair and torso, though'
p17545
aS' Plo Koon: Beautiful! The true gem of this set, in my opinion'
p17546
aS" The head is the same material as Kit Fisto's"
p17547
aS' And the tosro is awesome, good for making a custom Ki-Adi Mundi'
p17548
aS" Well, that's about it, here is the"
p17549
aS' FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, very fun and easy, should take the seasoned builder about 4 hours'
p17550
aS' Somewhat fragile'
p17551
aS' Playability: 9'
p17552
aS'5/10, Lots of fun features, although some can break easily'
p17553
aS" Swooshability: 3/10, I wouldn't recommend flying it around much, as you can barely pick it up safely"
p17554
aS' But with two hands gripping the bottom firmly, it can be moved around, but not spun or swooshed, etc'
p17555
aS' Minifigs: 8/10, all very great figs, especially Plo Koon, but could have included more clone troopers'
p17556
aS' Design: 7'
p17557
aS'5/10, some excellent ideas included in here, although some spots are very fragile'
p17558
aS' Price: 7/10: Should have been only 100 USD if not for the new molds'
p17559
aS' Plus, at TRU, it was 130 USD'
p17560
aS' Overall score: 8'
p17561
aS'5/10, a great set to have for your star wars/ clone wars collection, with some flaws'
p17562
aS' Save up for this one'

p17645
aS' We had a fantastic time and it gave me the chance to pick up some of the new Castle sets and battlepacks I was really impressed by the sets I bought and decided to do my first review'
p17646
aS' let battle commence! Set name: Tower Raid Set number: 7037 Price GBP: 19'
p17647
aS"99 Pieces: 364 The Models Here's a shot of the complete set: The set is made up of two models, the Crown Knight's tower and the Orc's siege tower"
p17648
aS" Let's start with the Crown Knight's tower: A knight readies himself for battle! My favourite model from the set, the wicked Orc's siege tower: Please note that for the purposes of display I mounted the Orc's banner onto a small cone set on the top platform of the siege tower"
p17649
aS" This doesn't come with the set but saves any Orcs having to hold onto it all he time! There are other areas it can be placed without using extra parts"
p17650
aS' Features Both models look great and have excellent features'
p17651
aS" The set as a whole has great playability and seems to have been concieved with a storyline: the Crown Knight's have a captured Orc within the walls of their tower so the Orc army has been sent out to recover him"
p17652
aS" or are they merely after the gold the knights keep horded away?! The Orc's siege tower has a powerful ram - spring-loaded by the simple arrangement of an elastic band - so pulling it back sends it flying out the front, knocking down the wall on the side of the knight's tower"
p17653
aS"and releasing the captive Orc! The floor panels inside the prison are laid over a lip on the inside of the collapsible wall, so fall in when they're not supported"
p17654
aS" There's a string at the rear for extending the boarding ramp"
p17655
aS'and letting a fearsome Orc warrior charge across! Flick-fire action! The battle heats up as the Orcs close in! The Minifigures The Crown Knights: I really like the Crown Knights'
p17656
aS" They're metallic helmets look great and they come with nice accessories"
p17657
aS" The archer has a double printed head with a frightened look on the other side too! I'm not surprised, I'd be frightened when staring over the ramparts at these"
p17658
aS' The Orcs: These guys really do look the part, worthy advesaries to the Crown Knights! The details are superb: the printed elements, weapons and helmets, all set the Orcs aside on the battlefield'
p17659
aS' The set comes with a great new molded armour neckpiece too'
p17660
aS" The mighty Orc leader looks wicked in his full battlegear! Overview There's so much to this set it's hard not to be impressed"
p17661
aS" The Orc's siege engine is a thing of beauty (or terror!) and would look great on any battlefield"
p17662
aS" The Crown Knight's tower although basic, looks good and has great playability"
p17663
aS" I'm a big fan of the new Castle knights and fantasy minifigures and the inclusion of five of them is just enough for this set and as a booster to any army"
p17664
aS' At 19'
p17665
aS'99 in the UK this set is well worth the money for content and quality'
p17666
aS" I'd highly recommmend this set as a must-have purchase for anyone A final shot of the siege tower with a host of Orcs ready for battle: I hope you enjoyed my review, I'll be posting my next one for 7040 Dwarves Mine Defender soon!"
p17667
aS'I got this set in the spring during my "buy every new Castle set available"-season'
p17668
aS" Granted, I couldn't afford all of them, but I do have most of them now"
p17669
aS' Anyway, I love the action elements to this set, and the siege tower really does look wicked'
p17670
aS" I'd like to attach the Crownie tower to the King's Castle to see how it fits, but I unfortunately don't own that set (yet)"
p17671
aS" I also love the turning head of the soldier, and I've used it in my Princess Quest-comic as well, along with the turning head of the princess"
p17672
aS' The Troll Leader brings good variety to the army of trolls, but they still could use another face type and more torso options'
p17673
aS" It's a nice review, in any case, although the set pretty much speaks for itself"
p17674
aS'Hey, good review and good photos'
p17675
aS" I also got this set just recently, and I wasn't very enthusiastic about it at the beginning, but after I built it I could appreciate it"
p17676
aS" The siege engine is very nice, but my complaint has do with the proportions of the knight's tower in respect to the trolls' machine - it's a bit smaller, and less bulkier"
p17677
aS' That complaint has to go with some other sets too'
p17678
aS" For example the troll warship is really humongous - it feels like it can load the evil wizard's tower and sail off"
p17679
aS' Other than that - a good set, I like it, 4/5 from me'
p17680
aS'Excellent review and your pictures are very good, I look forward to seeing more review'

p17705
aS" Besides knocking down the wall at the side, can the battering ram do any other damage to the tower (ex, reducing it to rubble bricks)? And why can't the orc just jump out of the hole in the back? Do they need to do that much unnecessary damage to the tower?"

aS' This is an amazing review - bits of humor, great photography, and detailed descriptions/photos'
p17722
aS" Based upon this review I've placed an order for this set (along with some convincing from Amazon's 20% sale )"
p17723
aS' The only drawbacks in this set that I can see concerns the tower with it being 1) small compared to the seige tower and 2) missing a few walls'
p17724
aS" However, this is also the joy of LEGO as one can simply purchase a few bricks and build their own walls and/or expand the tower's size (or even attach it to a castle)"
p17725
aS' Of course, this increases the price of the set, but considering how cheap bricks are on BrickLink, Tower Raid is still a very good value'
p17726
aS' I hope you continue doing reviews, pedro'
p17727
aS'Th set was fantastic becuase it was cheap and supplied a very good amount of pecies and had rather good minifigures'
p17728
aS'I have one of these and must say that this is THE best Castle set in the theme, and the most useful parts pack for its size yet'

aS'Name: Jungle Duel Set ref: 7624 Number of minifigs: 3 Number of pieces: 90 Price: $9'
p17730
aS'00 A basic review of 7624 (my apologies for the blurry and grainy pictures my camera is acting up ): The build is nothing speicial on to the figs Indiana Jones, Mutt Williams and Irina Spalkoi, nice array of minifigs although I think they should have included a russian soldier or two'
p17731
aS' If you look to the right on Mutts jacket it has his name in script, the tent is great aside from the fact that the fabric bends easily a nice amount of speicial pieces the weapons rack is pretty nifty so is the table when you swap the white piece with a black one overall it is a very nice set, the $10'

p17769
aS' I have mine set up differently than in the instructions'
p17770
aS' I put one cone over the hump on one end of the staff, and the other in the original spot'
p17771
aS' Then, to load them onto the fighter, all you do is push the original placed cone down and put it right in'
p17772
aS' This way, the staff looks better and it works the same! See? It slides right in: Skeletal parts of sides attached: Close Up: Bottom: Both Wings Attached: Hidden Missle Launcher: Raised Up: Another Shot: Staffs Attached: Complete: Side Panel: Side Pods: Complete: Swooshable!: Finished!: Time to complete: >2hrs'
p17773
aS' Okay, Overall rating time! PRICE: 9/10- Could have been 40'
p17774
aS'00 USD, but due to new molds, this is understandable'
p17775
aS' PARTS: 9/10- Could have hade more Dark Red, but thats IMO'
p17776
aS' Plus, I love Dark Red! BUILD TIME: 8/10- I took my time on this and enjoyed the techniques the designers intricated'
p17777
aS' Also, taking pics added to the time quite a bit'
p17778
aS' PLAYABILITY: 7/10- The main playability functions are the missle launchers in the back and the sliding cockpit'
p17779
aS" My only gripe with these is they don't set right with the other slopes on the top"
p17780
aS' Also, the inside of the cockpit is easily modded for regular size minifigs'
p17781
aS' Just pop a handlebar piece in the already provided arm in the cockpit and bam, your favorite figs can have a ride! It also helps keep the Magnaguards in place if they hold it'
p17782
aS' MINIFIGS: 10/10- IMO, the new molds are great! The only downfall is the right arm on both is less moveable due to the hard plastic turban-thing connected to the head'
p17783
aS" SWOOSHABILITY: 9/10- The starfighter is pretty sleek, and very swooshable! DESIGN: 9/10- The most important aspect, and this one's a winner! It's only a nine because it needs to have smoother edges in a few spots, but they are easily MODable"

p17851
aS', that was a weird race! Anyway, I love the look of both sets, but i\'ll have to go for the Dino Attack Quad for a couple of reasons: It is post-apoc, which I love, features tan and dark red colours which are far more useful than yellow, you get more "bang for your buck" with the Dino set, you get a little dino (sure you can hate it but better than not having one right?), and the fig has much more useful pieces and a better face'

aS" It's bigger and more detailed than the Coast guard one"
p17855
aS' Plus, I think there is a hinge in the back of it, so there is apparently some more playability to it as well'
p17856
aS" I love the post-apoc style fig! It's detailed and simply looks cool! Also, while the Digger fig has quite an individual look to it, the Coast Guard driver has the generic hero head and Coast Guard uniform"
p17857
aS" It's an overal better deal, especially if you count the LUDP which gives the set a whole lot more playability, no matter how U the LDP may be"
p17858
aS' Tan & post-apoc figs ON!'
p17859
aS'that was an intresting race And i was split between the two until i saw whitefang`s reply and the fact you can use the sprinter as a militery thing(which you could do for both but sprinter just pulls it off better) and i like the radar on the back of it so i`ll have to go with the street sprinter'

aS'I like the Coast Guard one, but Dinos eat Coast Guard people, so Dinos ftw'
p17867
aS' And I think the dino bike would fit in with my collection pretty well'
p17868
aS'i like the dino thingy because of the pieces and the dino is a lot of fun on its own (i know, thats akward)'
p17869
aS'Dino Attack for me! You just cant say no to a huge Bazooka! Though the tan and dark red works for me too'

aS"The Rancor, on Aug 2 2008, 09:39 AM, said: I wish I had that but I'll have to make do with the much less violent European Version (Dino '2010' not 'ATTACK') Here's a comaprison"
p17871
aS' European Version: USA etc'
p17872
aS" version: There's a subtle difference, but I prefer the US one I did not know that Europe had a different quad (or at least one without the bazooka)"
p17873
aS' Interesting that the gun was removed from the European sets, or added to the US sets'
p17874
aS' I sort of like the chain'
p17875
aS' I also notice a big difference in the boxart'
p17876

p17877
aS' I wonder if the story was different as well? Thanks for sharing a good picture'
p17878
aS' ----------------------------------------- Well, it does look like the Dino Quad has the upper hand; almost double the votes'
p17879
aS'Dino Attack quad for me'
p17880
aS" No, this isn't because I own it and not the other one, but because I think just about everything is better in it - the design is better, the colors are cooler, and it has a better figure"
p17881
aS" I don't like the figure in the coast guard quad at all - but since it was from World City, I'm not suprised"
p17882
aS' I also kinda like the dino, actually'
p17883
aS" It's flexible and fits in with the previous dinos a lot better than the cruddy bigger ones with bright red, yellow, and green highlights"
p17884
aS'ooooooh! this is a very hard choice,i like this new coast guard theme but i LOVED! Dino Attack'
p17885
aS'The Dino Attack set has a weird looking gun,but IMO the Coast Guard set looks'

aS'cleaner if you get what i mean'

p17899
aS' It is getting dark here right now, so some of the pictures are a bit dark'
p17900
aS' 1) Minifigs: The set comes with two of the new Clone Wars clone troopers, which in my opinion are pretty cool'
p17901
aS' It also comes with two short blasters and a bag of clone accessories'
p17902
aS' Figs with helmets: Figs without helmets: 2) The tank: This thing is HUGE (25cm long and 22cm wide), and far oversized in my opinion, but looks great nonetheless'
p17903
aS' I very much like the white and dark red color scheme, mixed with a bit of lime green (even though there is no lime green bricks ;) )'
p17904
aS' Left side: Right side: Back side: Both of the wings contain a hidden compartment to store the blasters and a part that rotates to reveal three flickfire missiles'

aS' The front opens up as well to reveal the engine'
p17906
aS' The side guns and the gun on the top rotate'
p17907
aS' Inside the cockpit is space for two figs; one seated in front of two computer screens and one placed in a moveable seat, which moves up and down, allowing the fig to pop up the top hatch and staying hidden while the hatch is closed'
p17908
aS' This function is triggered by opening the backdoor'
p17909
aS' Hidden compartment and missiles: Engine: Top hatch (open/closed): Interior: 3) Rating: Build: 9/10 Not much to say here'
p17910
aS' Minifigs: 7/10 An extra fig or two would have been great; eventually a Jedi or a commando'
p17911
aS' Design: 8/10 This only looses a couple of points for being oversized, but its a great looking model'
p17912
aS' Parts: 10/10 At 592 parts, this is one of the CW sets with the best parts/price ratio'
p17913
aS' Price: 8/10 Sure this thing is great, but I think its overpriced at 569 kr'
p17914
aS' (approx'
p17915
aS' $120)'
p17916
aS' When build it feels more like a 450 kr'
p17917
aS' Set'
p17918
aS' Final verdict: 9/10 Despite some flaws this thing is definitely recommended, and it looks great on your shelf, too ;)'
p17919
aS'I know it would really go well with the RGS but it is not enough for 50'
p17920
aS' Ill wait for the Sales at Christmas'
p17921
aS'Nice review , for Portugal it costs 60'
p17922
aS' I also consider it oversized, it shold be the third of that size'
p17923
aS' Portugal and Spain may have good prices but 90 for the V-19 must be a tippo'
p17924
aS"Finally a review of this, thanks! 120 bucks? This tank looks tiny and though it's amazingly detailed it should have been smaller and only 40/50 bucks at most"
p17925
aS" It just doesn't play that big a part man"
p17926
aS" Good pieces and mechanisms but no one's going to both buying a 120 buck tank, no offence, not unless it it's the AT-TE"

aS'One question'
p17937
aS' Do the top panels on the rotating rocket assembly mounted in the skids pop off regularly when you flip them back and forth? The ones on the version I built from the instructions posted online seem to eject with the slightest provocation'

aS' To me it does feel a bit fig light, for 50 Id expect maybe one or two more clones'

aS" Overall: 4/10 There just isn't enough here"
p18130
aS' It could at least have a better color scheme and instead of DV it could come with a Stormie like the old one did'
p18131
aS'Thanks for the review'
p18132
aS' I actually like the older Tie better, since it had a stand for the Tie'
p18133
aS' Not really a fan of the LU figs either'
p18134
aS' No matter - a Tie is a Tie and this is a must have fighter for any LEGO SW fan out there'
p18135
aS" Never can get enough Ties, except the Tie Advanced or Vader's Tie"
p18136
aS"they don't rock"
p18137
aS' KimT'
p18138
aS'Great review! Really shows off the main aspects of the set'
p18139
aS' Wish I had picked up a TIE when they were around'
p18140
aS' DSR'
p18141
aS'And now for something completely different: Tiny Turbos belonging to the racers line! When I saw 8147 bullet run on S@H for half the price I couldnt resist buying it'
p18142
aS' We had a lot of fun celebrating a bag-build at our event using the 8150 ZX Turbo of that theme so I knew what would expect me with this "extended" set'
p18143
aS' Price: normal 49,99 now 24,99 (well I paid 34,99 in a Lego store but thats another story'
p18144
aS') Bricks: 796 Minifigs: - Hey, this is tiny turbos, stupid! Stickers: Dont ask (or read further) The open box reveals seven polybags, some with more smaller polybags inside, the instruction booklet, 2 ramps and the sticker sheet'
p18145
aS' Of course I put all of the bags on the table and not on the floor Hey, TLC didnt print this on the first page of the building instructions! And you wont see any piece callouts as well'
p18146
aS' On the other hand this is not adifficult build, so why show them? Still there is an inventory list of all bricks at the end of the instructions'
p18147
aS' Note the giant sticker sheet! We all now the DSS, but that is a new kind of extra super large sticker sheet'
p18148
aS' It holds 82 stickers! More to that later on'
p18149
aS' The build is quite basic'
p18150
aS' The only non-conventional parts of the build were the two slammers'
p18151
aS' And the most annoying part was fiddling the rubber band of the holder without destroying it'
p18152
aS' Bag 1: Easy beginning: Building the lime car, the limo and the two slammers'
p18153
aS' Nothing exciting about the lime car, but the limo was neat'
p18154
aS' Its an 18 studs long car! The normal racers are abot 10 studs long'
p18155
aS' Nice way to put the horns on the back! The slammers'
p18156
aS' Mmmmh'
p18157
aS' Nice invention if they would actually DO something'
p18158
aS' They are supposed to give the Tubros a kick in the butt to speed them up, but the result is a 80 cm long "run" and thats it'
p18159
aS' I had expected more acceleration from the slammers'
p18160
aS' But its also fun to play with the cars without slamming them'
p18161
aS' Bag 2: Convoy time: The tow truck and the fuel truck The tow truck is a great idea and a good addition to the set'
p18162
aS' The cars are supposed to crash - how do they get back home? Well, heres the answer'
p18163
aS' Quite american layout of the truck and its very well done: Horns, 5 flashing lights and a right color choice'
p18164
aS' You can move the arm up and down and pull out the hook'
p18165
aS' Note the metallic silver antennae'
p18166
aS' The fuel tank has got a "secret" function'
p18167
aS' It may break on the middle of the trailer'
p18168
aS' Therefore it has a hinge build in the bottom'
p18169
aS' City fire mayhem! And theres no fire engine'
p18170
aS' Bag 3: Long, longer, how long can a "tiny" truck be? The pipe truck, an unexpected buggy and the red racer'
p18171
aS' 36+ studs long: The pipe truck breaks every convention'
p18172
aS' The cabin is almost the same like the tow truck and the fuel truck and that is the good part of it'
p18173
aS' The trailer has to carry pipes and is functional as well as it can commute sidewarts'
p18174
aS' It looks quite unrealistic as well and you cannot drive this beast on tiny roads'
p18175
aS' Good for another crash'
p18176
aS' But there are more cars in this bag'
p18177
aS' Now this was a surprise: A buggy? This is the only 6(+)-wide car, but just because the wheels are large'
p18178
aS' Monster truck madness? I dont care for those cars'
p18179
aS' Personally a disappointment, I would have preferred another racer'
p18180
aS' + for variety though'
p18181
aS' Did I say another racer? Here we are: The red devil'
p18182
aS' Great looking, a real fast shape and red'
p18183
aS' The best racer in this set'
p18184
aS' Vrooommm! This is the most "played with" car of the set'
p18185
aS' (Not only from me )'
p18186
aS' As you may have noticed I didnt put any stickers so far'
p18187
aS' I dont like stickers especially when placed over two or more bricks! And here you are supposed to do it several times'
p18188
aS' Of course the cars look better with stickers on, but they are also great without stickers'
p18189
aS' Only the fuel truck looks boring without'
p18190
aS' My sons didnt know there were supposed to be stickers and they didnt ask for them'
p18191
aS' So everything is allright! Heres a closeup of the sticker sheet (did I already mention it was 82 stickers? ): The only exception I made using sticker was for bag 4: Bag 4: You go here? You pay! The highway toll booth'
p18192
aS' The only immobile part of the set, but great to brake though the barriers'
p18193
aS' That is fun! I only put on stickers on 2x2 plates where I had the idea to use those plates further on on different other MOCs'
p18194
aS' This looks a bit boring without the other stickers I admit'
p18195
aS' But still no cut off to the playability! There are also two ramps belonging to the set'
p18196
aS' These only make sense if you are able to speed up the racers with the slammers and hit the ramps correctly'
p18197
aS' I had problems with that, so they are on the shelves now'
p18198
aS' Could be a lot fun making a contest though'
p18199
aS' Like this (picture of the inventories frontpage) All cars put together: The usual leftovers: All in all this is a great set to call ones own! I did not regret buying it, especially when it was 50% off! Even normal price would not have been too much'
p18200
aS' Build: Great for smaller children, boring to AFOLs: 5/10 Special bricks/colors: None, all basics: 3/10 Design: I love the tiny turbos size and design: 9/10 Playability: -1 because of the slammers, another -1 because no minifig-scale'
p18201
aS' But that is not the intention of the set: still 9/10 Price/piece ratio: Dang! Its not on sale any more'
p18202
aS' But if you hurry you could still grab one in the Lego stores'
p18203
aS' 10/10 All in all: 8'
p18204
aS'5/10 and a clear recommendation! It was and still is a set to play with your children'
p18205
aS' The size fits perfectly to Matchbox cars and that was exactly what my younger son did: Can you find all of the cars included in the set? P'
p18206
ag264
aS': After buying this set I won an ebay auction with another tiny turbos set - 8135 bridge chase'
p18207
aS' This is even more fun! I will soon care for a review with some never seen photo-tricks as well'
p18208

p18210
aS'This set was on my wanted list for a long time and the sales at S@H came just in time I also loved the set, and like you only put the stickers on the toll both (it looks great on a town layout with almost no modifications)'
p18211
aS' The racers are great'
p18212
aS' The trucks and the limo are the best in my oppinion'
p18213
aS" The sticker sheet is huge, but I've seen bigger"
p18214
aS' Stickers over multiple pieces are the worst The slammers are ok, but not great'
p18215
aS' I played with my 4 years old son and we tryed to do what shows in the box (the cars passing the toll, jumping the ramps and crashing the trucks) but it is very difficult to get it right'
p18216
aS' But the crashes are very fun'
p18217
aS'Thanks for the review'
p18218
aS" I'll definately get this set sooner or later"
p18219
aS' IMO the Tiny Turbos are awesome'
p18220
aS' I actually bought nearly every set so far, built the models, added the stickers and packed them away in zip-lock bags in the attic'
p18221
aS" Sadly I don't have display room for them (yet)"
p18222
aS' A fine set, carwise'
p18223
aS' Dump the slammers and buildings into the spare bag and keep the cars'
p18224
aS' KimT TINY TURBOS ON!'

aS"Tiny Turbos are good for parts, but I'm not so keen on them as they have no minifig drivers"

aS' I crossed the German border and bought me this one mainly for the parts'
p18241
aS' To get time going, I built the models and made this small review for you to enjoy (or hate) High resolution pics can be found here when public'
p18242
aS' Set# 4994 Title: Fierce Creatures Price: 9'
p18243
aS'99 EURO / 12'
p18244
aS'99 USD Pieces: 193 Minifigs: 0 The Box: The box looks awesome! It has some great animations of the 3 models in the instruction'
p18245
aS' The rear of the box shows some nice up-close-and-personal drawings of each model'
p18246
aS' I think it works better having the models drawn instead of a mere photo of them'
p18247
aS' Somehow it allows the great colour-scheme to really show'
p18248
aS' The Instructions: The instruction is easy to follow and shows which pieces are used in each building step'
p18249
aS' That makes it all a lot easier, especially with so many small pieces as in this set'
p18250
aS' The bricks are divided into 3 polybags and the instruction is a fine small book, which can be easily stored along the rest of your ever-growing amount of booklets and pamphlets printed by TLG'
p18251
aS' The models: Model 1 is a spider and its nasty'
p18252
aS' The 2x2 modified brick with the hole would allow one to hang it from a string'
p18253
aS' This beast is sure to give you several nightmares, were it hanging from a string in your bedroom'
p18254
aS'  So I wouldnt do that (plus the fact that my wife threw away the box and ordered me to take the spider apart when she saw it  Shes an arachnophobian and does not take spiders lightly)'
p18255
aS' It looks real, in a brickish-non-real-way'
p18256
aS' Model 2 is a snake'
p18257
aS' Theres not much to say other than the head is awesomely designed and the rest is bad'
p18258
aS' The body is poorly designed and does not live up to the coolness of the head'
p18259
aS' Build the head, ignore the rest'
p18260
aS' Model 3 is a flying scorpion or something'
p18261
aS' Not as realistic as the spider, but still a great model with a cool head'
p18262
aS' The tail is a bit poorly designed, but itll do and it does offer some good ideas on how to use bricks'
p18263
aS' All in All Verdicts: This is an ok Creator set'
p18264
aS' It holds a lot of fine pieces and the models are an ok inspiration'
p18265
aS' Given its size, its an ok set'
p18266
aS' But its nothing more than that'
p18267
aS' Ill give it an average score'
p18268
aS' I enjoyed building the models and fumbling with the bricks in the shade during a siesta on my vacation'
p18269
aS' And thats what it is, an enjoyable build and a little inspiration on a hot day with a Erdinger Dunkel Weissbier in my other hand'

aS'I once bought a entire Lego collection including this set'
p18330

p18331
aS' Seeing this fine review has given me new motivation to do so'
p18332
aS' Nice work again Skipper!'
p18333
aS'My review gave you motivation to build a set'
p18334
aS' My review was better than I thought'
p18335
aS'Skipper, thanks for doing up all these SW Reviews'
p18336
aS' It certainly had given me some valuable insights on these sets especially on the Snowspeeder'
p18337
aS' It kind of making me regret to pass off this set'
p18338
aS' However, I had bought the hoth base instead but had never built it'
p18339
aS' I am just wondering if the snowspeeder had any difference? Keep up the good work and always strive your best to make each upcoming review a better one'
p18340
aS"There isn't much difference apart form it has stickers on and is grey"
p18341
aS' Also the guns and tow cable gun are different as well as the engines'
p18342
aS' But if you look at pictures of the Hoth base speeder not to much is noticeable'
p18343
aS'I have mixed feelings about this set'
p18344
aS" It's one of the sets that sent my into a dark age (the birth of my son contributed heavily)"
p18345
aS' When I first saw this set I was convinced that the earlier Snowspeeder (7130) was superior in every way'
p18346
aS' I liked the look of the 7130 version better, I liked the coloration of it better'
p18347
aS' The turret was better (it used a webbed 6 x 6 dish)'
p18348
aS' After seeing this review, I realize I was wrong on some accounts'
p18349
aS' The cockpit is much more movie accurate'
p18350
aS' The 7130 version had two separate compartments'
p18351
aS' This version also came with a tow cable, something that was lacking from the previous set'
p18352
aS' While I still am unimpressed with the overall look of this set, it is much less blocky, which is always a good thing'
p18353
aS' Overall, I still prefer 7130 to the 4500 version'
p18354
aS" But the 4500 isn't nearly as bad as I first assumed, and I regret never buying one of these when I had my chance"
p18355
aS'Great review! I bought this set when it came out but sold it a couple years later for some extra cash'
p18356
aS' I have no regrets selling this one, as I was never really impressed with it (different story for the 4483 AT-AT - oh how I wish I still had that one)'
p18357
aS' The snowspeeder was alright, just didn\'t have any sort of "wow" factor to it'
p18358
aS' The best part of the set is probably the Rebel Trooper'
p18359
aS" Looking at the last photo in your review, looks like you're about to have a major battle in your hallway"
p18360
aS" Apart from the snowspeeder & motorized AT-AT, I see the ARC-170 Fighter, Grievous's starfighter, and is that a podracer I see -- and what is the set with the treads? It's not Star Wars, but looks like a pretty cool set (maybe a Mission Mars vehicle)"
p18361
aS"Podracer not sure where you got that from (I didn't have them out)? The set with treads is a Dino 2010 thing which fits in well after a bit of modding"
p18362
aS' Also there are some of the old EXO-Force sets out there like the Fire Vulture because I always saw them fitting well with Star Wars'
p18363
aS"Skipper 24, on Aug 4 2008, 12:52 PM, said: Podracer not sure where you got that from (I didn't have them out)? I noticed the minifig between the Grievous starfighter & the mod-Dino2010 vehicle and it looked like a little person sitting in the pod of his podracer"

aS' Guess my eyes are playing tricks on me -- my eyesight is shot & my wife keeps pushing me to go visit the optometrist'
p18365
aS'Nope there is a guy sitting there'
p18366
aS" He's there because on Dine 2010 there were no guns like on Dino attack, so so I made a big gun like on the Dino attack set"

aS' Design: 5/10 Not really to scale but otherwise okay apart from Boga which just looks like any old dinosaur'

p18420
aS' Playability: 10/10 You can easily recreate the movie scenes with this set'
p18421
aS' Overall 7/10 It would be better if the bike and Boga were more to scale and more accurate as well as the set having more parts'

aS'Not one of my favourite SW sets'

aS" I got this set for a very low price as well, and for that, it's a very nice parts pack with 2 neat, exclusive figs!"

p18532
aS" I haven't seen the first one so i cant really comment"
p18533
aS'That was indeed a set that never appealed to me'
p18534
aS' Its build was just plain wrong and awful'
p18535
aS' I only bought it because I found it on clearance at around 15 (and they had 4 of them'
p18536
aS" If I had known better then, I'd have bought all 4; Seeing how much that Jango Fett minifig is worth now"
p18537
aS' ) But I ended up heavily modifying it in its propoions and now it looks ok next to the new Slave One (which is the best one of its 3 incarnations, I think)'

p18563
aS' No printed pieces - No accessories (a wrench, gas can, and other extras would have added to the set) - No extra tire for blow outs SUMMARY: I picked this set up new a number of years ago as a true "Impulse Buy", after buying one of the larger Outback sets (Amazon Crossing or Outback Airstrip)'

p18730
aS' I\'m still a bit freaked out by the yellow ones! When I emerged from my Dark Ages I kept thinking "gee, I miss the people packs", but now that I have over 500 mini-figures I don\'t feel that way anymore'
p18731
aS' Even so, I wish they would re-release some of the classic old ones'
p18732
aS'I voted "above average" as well, but back in 1983, I would have probably gone much lower'
p18733
aS" Sadly, I wasn't as interested in minifigs at the time"
p18734
aS' I appreciated the ones I had, but I really just wanted ships or bases, and would have gladly passed this by for something with one or two figures and a small moon rover'
p18735
aS' I skipped all of the classic minifig sets, space, castle and town'
p18736
aS' It was only upon coming out of my dark ages that I went minifig crazy'
p18737
aS' For me, this is above average because of the accessories'
p18738
aS" Without them, it's an average set"
p18739
aS' With a small brick built droid or a rover, it would be outstanding'
p18740

aS' I never had any of these classic space figs before'
p18747
aS' If TLG could ever released this again, I am pretty sure I will grab multiple packs without a glimpse'

aS'7674 V-19 Torrent Number of Pieces: 471 Number of Minifigs: 1 Price: 49'
p18777
aS'99 The V-19 Torrent starfighter was an assault fighter with exceptional speed and maneuverability used by the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars'
p18778
aS'It was a predecessor of the Alpha-3 Nimbus-class V-wing starfighter, in terms of purpose and usage'
p18779
aS' It first appeared in the Genndy Tartakovsky?s Clone wars 2D series'
p18780
aS' Basics Box front: The box art shows the torrent flying above Tatooine, with the new blue and white ?clone wars?? style packaging, Box back: The back shows some of the features of the set including the lifting mechanism and adverts for 7679 Republic Gunship, 7675 AT-TE and the 7673 MagnaGuard starfighter Inside the box, there are 2 instruction books, a very small DSS and 9 bags that are not numbered'
p18781
aS' Bags: Instruction books Random manual shot Parts list Book one is mainly the construction of the body and one of the engines, Book 2 is the other engine and the wings'
p18782
aS" For better pics of the manual look on lego's website"
p18783
aS' Sticker sheet: A very small sticker sheet is included, which includes 2 republic insignias and a nose sticker'
p18784
aS' Minifigure One minifigure is included, a clone pilot'
p18785
aS' The whole "OMG only one minifigure in this set" and "Its not movie accurate, i hate you TLC!!!11one2" has been beaten to death, so please don\'t make this review turn into that and to be honest i don\'t care because its an awesome figure'
p18786
aS' TLC have made the effort to print the life support device onto the chest plate so props to them'
p18787
aS' He has the "clone head" like the rest of the clones have in the CW releases, there are no extra clone bits apart from a long blaster, that\'s not included here'
p18788
aS' Interesting/other pieces Printed piece! Rare/unusual pieces: there are 2 pistons included, as well as 2 weird looking technic pieces that serve as the landing gear during the build'
p18789
aS" which might explain why the set is quite expensive, it musn't have been cheap to manufacture them"
p18790
aS' The build It starts off relatively simple, the first 16 steps is getting the basic shape of the cockpit and the mechanism to make the middle wing move up and down'
p18791
aS" After that the next few steps are getting the landing gear/wing folding device done, it's actually the same thing so when the wings move into attack mode the landing gear retracts"
p18792
aS' This is then locked into place by the white beams that form the basic shape of the fuselage'
p18793
aS' Up to step 46 is the fuselage, as well as fitting the hydraulics'
p18794
aS' This is what it looks like when the fuselage is complete'
p18795
aS' The cockpit is not "air tight", there\'s is quite a big gap Top: Bottom: The final few steps of book 1 is the construction of one of the engines, here it is attatched : The yellow bar is not permanent, its used to keep the white bit at the top from moving downwards'
p18796
aS" The steps are repeated in the second book so that both engines are now in On to the wings! First one attatched, The middle one is attached now: and finally the last one: It is now finished! The pieces that are left: So, you're probably wondering, how does it enter attack mode? well can you see this bar? push that bar to the center, and pick it up, the hydraulics move the central wing downwards as well as the side wings to enter attack mode: The outer wings have flickfire missiles on them, they obviously don't work, but it increases the playability of the set"
p18797
aS" The cockpit opens in a similar way to General Grevious's starfighter released last year, using a sliding mechanism For other pics see here : http://s25"

aS"eview/?start=20 and i'll be taking other requests for pics, maybe a video of it switching between modes"

p18801
aS' Minifigs: 5/10 1 fig in a 50 set, however it is a starfighter Design: 9/10 very accurate to the source material, Lego have really made the effort to make the movement feature work'

aS'First, thanks simonjedi for a great review'
p18825
aS" I'm interested in what you think of the hydrolics"
p18826
aS' I could spend hours just deploying and undeploying the wings and landing gear'
p18827
aS" I'm a little worried, the very first batch of the hydrolic piece for, umm, I think it was the off-road 4x4 Technic set, was very fragile and broke after a few uses"
p18828
aS" These seem to be holding up but I'm anxious to see if they hold up after 100-200 uses"
p18829
aS" quote name='Walter Kovacs' date='Aug 4 2008, 11:47 AM' post='337841'] Those black pieces used on the landing gear look very Bionicle-like"

p18831
aS" Not that I'm a Bionicle expert or anything"
p18832
aS' [/quote] Right you are'
p18833
aS' They are Bionicle Bohrok head pieces'
p18834
aS' So pretty old in Bionicle terms and fairly useless in my opinion but they do make interesting looking landing gear as I deploy and redeploy the wings and landing gear'
p18835
aS" Hopefully, we'll get a pilot in the battle pack to help mitigate the fact we only get one here"
p18836
aS' -Tohst'
p18837
aS"The printed part isn't new it came with 10178 motorized AT-AT walker"
p18838
aS' Also nice review, I would get the set if it was a little cheaper or came with more than 1 fig'
p18839
aS" Whyhas it got 2 instruction books the set isn't particularly big?"
p18840
aS'Thanks for the review'
p18841
aS" I've added it to the index and added a poll in which members can vote their opinion on this set"
p18842
aS' I think this is a very good set'
p18843
aS' I like the colours and the very playable feature that allows the wings to lock in attack formation'
p18844
aS' Now all I need is to buy this baby'
p18845
aS" Edit: I gave it an Above Average rating, since it's well designed, looks sturdy and fits the SW theme sets perfectly"
p18846
aS'Nice review Simon Jedi'
p18847
aS" The V-19 has been one of my favourite ships since the release of CWA and this is one of the sets I've been considering most about buying"
p18848
aS" It's great to see TLG's treatment of it"
p18849
aS" It looks like no expense was spared making it as aesthetically and functionally accurate as possible - though I think the cockpit windshield could maybe have been slightly bigger, but that's just me I'm sure"
p18850
aS' It looks pretty big compared to other starfighters too'
p18851
aS' Did it take a long time to build?'
p18852
aS'Great review simonjedi -- I really like that you included lots of photos of your build'
p18853
aS' I put together my V19 Torrent last night, and I was surprised by how heavy the completed ship is'
p18854
aS' It has some real heft'
p18855
aS" Once it's finished, WOW! it is a really cool ship"
p18856
aS" I was disappointed that the central wing doesn't really lock into place once it flips down"
p18857
aS" It just kind of droops there, so I attached a technic pin to the locking arm so it could plug into the 2x4 brick that's on the underside of the starfighter (this brick can be seen in your photo of the bottom of the ship)"
p18858
aS" Overall, the build is one of the more confusing that I've seen (I had to dismantle and re-build the first engine after I realized I'd left out a piece) and I kept thinking of the poor 7-year-old that gets this set as his/her very first LEGO set ever"

aS" It just didn't work out for me is all"
p18914
aS'I love this set and I gave it "Outstanding"'
p18915
aS' I might note though that the cylinder is just there as a dampener; when disenegaged the wing function still works, just not as smoothly'
p18916
aS" Interestingly though the cylinder is an old piece, (I have a few others) it's just that this is the first time it's been used without a spring"
p18917
aS' I had no problems assembling this set'
p18918
aS'Having just bought myself a copy of the wonderful metroliner (4558) I felt like doing a review'
p18919
aS" Before we start I'd like to thank Greenhair for selling me one of his metroliners for a mere 80 euros"
p18920
aS' Granted, the motor, "trainstation" and tracks weren\'t included but I did get an extra railcar instead'
p18921
aS' - * (please note that I have included the fourth wagon in the final pic but that the official set includes just three wagons'
p18922
aS') The metroliner was released in 1992 and was extremely popular amongst lego fans'
p18923
aS' The set A picture of the box showing the set completely'
p18924
aS' (pic taken from peeron) and one of the minifigs and the accessories'
p18925
aS': As you may notice, TLC was extremely generous, supplying us with a grand total of 11 minifgs amongst which no less than 4 female minifigs'
p18926
aS' Ah, the population crisis is finally over We also have three suitcases, three cups and a small freight parcel and freight handling thingy'
p18927
aS' Normally this would include two bicycles; a red and a black one'
p18928
aS' A general side view of the three carriages'
p18929
aS" (thanks to Greenhair and the Brickster) And here's one of the extra carriage"
p18930
aS' (thanks to Greenhair and the Brickster) Moving onto the front and back carriage, which are externally identical'
p18931
aS" Please note that Greenhair changed my back carriage's headlights"
p18932
aS' These would be yellow in the normal set'
p18933
aS' All the doors in the entire set are printed pieces'
p18934
aS' (sorry for the bad picture quality in this one) The interior of the two however is laid out a bit differently'
p18935
aS' The space in the front carriage is occupied by a cockpit (or whatever it is called in trains) and some space to store your cable connecting the front lights with the engine'
p18936
aS' I can imagine it must get quite cramped and dangerous for the minifig driver with all the cabling'
p18937
aS' Further back we have a quite random, weird looking engine'
p18938
aS' One part reminded me rather of a jet engine on a commercial airplane'
p18939
aS' The engine is accessible by means of the two side cargo doors'
p18940
aS" At the end of our first carriage we hit what looks like the train's restaurant, two tables and no chairs"
p18941
aS' The two middle carriages are identical, both have a small sink nicely hidden from the intervening and impolite looks of fellow passengers'
p18942
aS' The carriage further contains two tables and four seats'
p18943
aS' Two cargo spaces are nicely tucked away from view below the tables'
p18944
aS' Our final carriage has a back cockpit as well but differs from the front carriage in the central cargo area - where our train employee is hard at work earning his lego nickels - and the rear sleeping area'
p18945
aS' The bed is a double one, the upper one able to be flipped up for somewhat difficult access to the lower one'
p18946
aS' The train station I could not take photos off since it was not included in the purchase'
p18947
aS" Judging from the building plans however I feel it was thrown in at the end just to add 'something' to the set"
p18948
aS' Its construction is very simple, consisting of a few grey plates on top of a few pillars'
p18949
aS' Access is provided by a plate which is connected to the platform with a few hinges'
p18950
aS" There are however two lamp posts, a timetable and a few chairs so if you don't like the platform you can still use these parts in a variety of other constructios"
p18951
aS' To end off I took a pic of the complete set (with extra wagon) and a friendly surprised train driver opening the door and greeting the camera man'
p18952
aS" Conclusion Being a '90s set, the train basically builds itself"
p18953
aS' The entire build cost me two hours and a half (I lost quite some time simply admiring the set) and was extremely straightforward with no suprises at all, but I need to admit it has its charm'
p18954
aS' The exterior is simply amazing'
p18955
aS' The sleekness of the design, the colours, it matches perfectly! I believe however that a width of 8 studs would be more to scale but 6 wide still looks amazing'
p18956
aS' The interior is somewhat simplistic but is easily moddeable with a few extra pieces'
p18957
aS' I basically bought the train as a parts pack'
p18958
aS' The standard set (three wagons) includes no less than 8 train doors with windows, 14 train windows, 4 smaller longer ones and 4 freight doors'
p18959
aS' The front and back of course count as unique pieces as well'
p18960
aS' One feature I am displeased with are the printed doors'
p18961
aS' I like printed pieces and while the blue-white-red stripe looks beautiful on the side the printed doors kind of limit MOCing capabilities to carriages with a stripe on the side'
p18962
aS' I considered simply removing the stripe but I found out I could just get normal grey ones from bricklink for a fair price'
p18963
aS' I am very pleased with the train but since you already know my opinion, feel free to tell us yours of this fabulous set! Edited by TheBrickster, 09 July 2009 - 01:51 PM'
p18964
aS' Poll question was not multiple choice, switched to radio group'
p18965
aS'I voted outstanding, this is simply an amazingly good looking train and comes with indeed 11 minifigs! I sold this one because i need a budget to build my ship, but i kept one because i love it! Not bad for a first review Ruben!'
p18966
aS'Ah, i wish modern trains had 11 figs'
p18967
aS' But seriously, why is there a civilian train stop in a CAVE?! did 1 too many people get lost playing ZORK? Edited by maiq the liar, 04 August 2008 - 10:21 PM'
p18968
aS'I remember to literally jump of joy when my grand-father offered it to me for Christmas'
p18969
aS" It's an amazing set, the train is really beautiful and it comes with 11 (!) MFs, so can somebody ask for more?"
p18970
aS"Thanks for the edit Hinckley! It's my first poll (and review) and I wasn't quite sure if I got it right maiq the liar, on Aug 5 2008, 12:20 AM, said: But seriously, why is there a civilian train stop in a CAVE?! did 1 too many people get lost playing ZORK? Yeah, I also wondered why the included timetable includes not only real life cities, instead of brick ones"
p18971
aS' Even more so since the train track just goes round'
p18972
aS' =D'
p18973
aS"Oh Ruben you lucky so and so this set is one of the most beautful i have ever seen! Splendid looking build and 11 figures, all the same faces like but still you get that old woman pig-tail head piece which is just great! I thought you meant the monorail set when you told me about this but guess i was wrong (don't laugh i've been away from lego for quite some time) and for 80 euros it was a real bargain from a great friend! Really nice review hope this sets brings you years of joy!"
p18974
aS'Cool Review'
p18975
aS' I actually have two of these'
p18976
aS' I got one for christmas when it was rereleased in 2003 and another one in a charity shop a few months later for 5'
p18977
aS' I love the minifigs even if they all have smileys, and having two sets of them can really fill up a town'
p18978
aS"It's great to see someone reviewing a TRAIN! This set is definately a FIVE! Lego hasn't made a complete train SET like this in a long time"
p18979
aS' The Metroliner is really a legend among classic trains'
p18980
aS' The great level of playability and detailing makes it a terrific model'
p18981
aS' Specifically, I was just noticing the details of the passenger car'
p18982
aS' It has a sink! - How cool is that? And 11 minifigs - when was the last time Lego included 11 figs in a single set? A truly outstanding train set'
p18983
aS" Thanks for sharing images as I've always wanted to see it up-close"
p18984
aS' It would be awesome if you could share some single side shots of the cars'
p18985
aS"I'm not normally that big into trains but this set has a real coolness factor that sets it apart from most of the others"
p18986
aS' The color scheme is the same one that Amtrak and many local subway systems use'
p18987
aS' I picked it up along with the club car expansion when they were re-released in 2001'
p18988
aS' I have made various modifications to mine, rearranging the car layouts and adding a second train motor into the rearmost car along with another set of lights, so that both ends light up'
p18989
aS' As you said, it would be great to have an 8-stud version of this, so you could fit in two rows of seats side by side'
p18990
aS' That might make a nice mod project at some point'
p18991
aS'Outstanding train set'
p18992
aS' The LEGEND of the entire train series, is the Metroliner'
p18993
aS' This is a "Super 5" set'
p18994
aS' The color, design, minifigs is just so perfect and lovely'
p18995
aS' It resemble the trains which we see on our rails in our daily life'
p18996
aS" I can't find any flaws on this at all"
p18997
aS' The only flaw I noticed is my mistake of not able to buy this set at all'
p18998
aS' In fact, I had never seen this set in the shops before in my entire life'
p18999
aS' TheBrickster, on Aug 5 2008, 09:23 AM, said: How cool is that? And 11 minifigs - when was the last time Lego included 11 figs in a single set? There is another set fufil the criteria above, which is also a well known LEGEND'
p19000
aS' It has 12 minifigs which is the 10159 City Airport aka Century Skyway Airport'
p19001
aS'Nice review I collect all metroliner i can, i have 3 metroliner and when i can, i buy a other '
p19002
aS" My aim : Have the more big metroliner collect, in France ( in first time ) It's my favorite set"
p19003
aS'Ahh, the good old train theme'
p19004
aS' How i wish TLG would make such great trains today, now that the quality of city sets has improved so much'
p19005
aS" That really brings back memories, even if i didn't have this one, but a cargo train that came out about the same time period, maybe plus a few years"
p19006
aS" I don't have any trains myself at the moment, mostly because i'm afraid i haven't got enough space to put in on display with all the rails and stuff"
p19007
aS'Really Nice Train, I always wished TLG would have made the passenger IR train longer and maybe used some of the nice features of this train, I still love that faucet piece'
p19008
aS'This is a great review of a great set, Hairy Ruben! I voted for Outstanding since the only thing you can say about this train set is that it is outstanding'
p19009
aS" It has been the best passenger train in all the time from Lego's beginning on until now"
p19010
aS' I bought the rereleased version of it in 2003 - and I really, really do not regret it! Klaus-Dieter'
p19011
aS'I also voted "Outstanding", for the simple reason that I\'ve owned this set for a long time, but for most of the time it\'s been an anonymous heap of bricks mixed with all the other bricks I have'
p19012
aS' So about a year ago I started rebuilding it, and it now sits proudly next to (also rebuilt) 2150 on my shelf'
p19013
aS" IMO; It's an excellent set, best of the 9V passenger trains, no doubt"
p19014
aS" And it combines the best of the 80's trains with that of the 90's - it's not some futuristic panorama-glassed low-slung train, but an honest, realistic-looking train that captures many of the features that passenger trains used to (and in some cases; still) have"
p19015
aS'Hairy Ruben, on Aug 5 2008, 12:00 AM, said: The interior of the two however is laid out a bit differently'

aS' The space in the front carriage is occupied by a cockpit (or whatever it is called in trains) and some space to store your cable connecting the front lights with the engine'
p19017
aS' I can imagine it must get quite cramped and dangerous for the minifig driver with all the cabling'
p19018
aS' Further back we have a quite random, weird looking engine'
p19019
aS' One part reminded me rather of a jet engine on a commercial airplane'
p19020
aS' The engine is accessible by means of the two side cargo doors'
p19021
aS" At the end of our first carriage we hit what looks like the train's restaurant, two tables and no chairs"
p19022
aS' There shouldn\'t be so much of the light cable in the front section or "cockpit'
p19023
aS'" Most of the cable should be in the central part of the train'
p19024
aS' Then it is not so crowded for the engine driver'
p19025
aS' I have never had a problem with the cable and the space available for it'
p19026
aS' The only problem I had was that the cable had a loose contact after some time'
p19027
aS" When the train went into a curve (can't remember if it was a left or right curve) the light went off"
p19028
aS' I have now got the same problem with the cable that I put into my Santa Fe Super Chief'
p19029
aS' Always when the engine turns into a right curve, the light goes off'
p19030
aS' My dad could repair the cable for the metroliner'
p19031
aS' Even though he is quite skilled at repairing electronic things, he found it very difficult to repair since there were no screws to open the electronic plate'
p19032
aS' It annoyed him a lot'
p19033
aS" So I've been asking myself if I should really bother him with a second cable with the same problem"
p19034
aS" The train set itself is outstanding (and that's what I voted for)"
p19035
aS" I only have the legend 10001, but it's 99% identical to 4558"
p19036
aS' I also have club car 4547'
p19037
aS" I don't have the legend club car 10002"
p19038
aS' The reason for this is I always had the choice between one big LEGO set or several small ones for Christmas when I was a child'
p19039
aS' I always went for several small ones'
p19040
aS' Metroliner 4558 would have been a big train set, but I really wanted a passenger car'
p19041
aS' So I bought 4547 with my savings without having the metroliner'
p19042
aS' I was quite happy when the metroliner was re-released'
p19043
aS' I bought it with my own money'
p19044
aS' Then I could finally use the club car with the train it was created for'

aS"I don't like the set and I do like the set"
p19047
aS' The reason why I like it: it looks good'
p19048
aS' The reason why I hate it: this train was the first train for the new 9v system and it means to me the end of the beautiful 12v series'
p19049
aS' For this last reason I own this set'
p19050
aS' I voted average'
p19051
aS' Only strange they named it metroliner'
p19052
aS' In Holland when we speak of a metro, I need to think at short distance trains only used in big cities like Rotterdam'
p19053

aS' In Holland when we speak of a metro, I need to think at short distance trains only used in big cities like Rotterdam'
p19056
aS' It was only named Metroliner in the US, because of the color scheme is similar to the real-life Metroliner'
p19057
aS' I believe in EU it was called the Euro-Express, and probably just "passenger train" wherever that would be suitable'
p19058
aS' The product-number 4558 is universal, though'
p19059
aS" Hairy Ruben, you don't have a review of the double-decker/club car on the way, do you? I myself never got it, and I am seriously considering buying one from Bricklink, plus it is more-or-less an requirement for this train (one of very few double-decker cars to actually stay within the general outer dimensions of the train)"
p19060
aS'My favourite, favourite, FAVOURITE old set'
p19061
aS" It's too bad I was born 2 years after its release, I would have had a major interest in Classic Town"
p19062
aS' I might actually get this one on Bricklink'
p19063
aS" not that it'll go for a good price (I'll only buy if it does you see)"

p19086
aS' It has however remained one of my most sought after items but Ive still never got around to getting one'
p19087
aS' The set generally makes me rather nostalgic for a time when the trains were painted in simple liveries like that one! Anyway it seems an excellent set from what Ive seen and the figure selection is amazing'
p19088
aS' I hope Lego produce something as good as this when the new trains are released next year'
p19089
aS'I got my Indy exclusive in the mail today'
p19090
aS' Packaging Front: Back: Instructions: Mini-figs This set comes with 1 mini-fig, the standard Indy with hat and whip-no satchel: The build I am really happy with the amount of frown headlight bricks that come with this set'
p19091
aS' 12 in all: The mudguards are cleverly built with 1 x 2 panels and 1 x 1 panel corners in dark green'
p19092
aS' In the first 2 pages of the instructions, there are a lot of great pieces'
p19093
aS' This set would sell like mad if it were released for sale'
p19094
aS' Parts monkeys alone would go insane buying these up for the dark green and frown pieces: The body of the car consists of black plates, brackets and modified bricks with curved tops that allow the dark green mudguards to just peak out'
p19095
aS' Cool technique: The grill looks cool using only six pieces'
p19096
aS" I wish all small sets were this unique and cool: Here's the completed jeep"
p19097
aS" It looks a little small for an actual jeep, but for a brickmaster set, it's awesome, IMO: Some more detail shots of the set with Indy in the driver's seat: I hope they take BrickMaster exclusives overseas because it'd be awesome if everybody could get these"
p19098
aS" My buddy CopMike would probably love to be the first to review this set, so I've dedicated my review comic to him: My rating Playability: 8/10 (You need to add some other sets and characters to really play with this set) Design: 9/10 (Great techniques and inclusion of rare parts, but loses a point for being an unrealistic size for a jeep) Price: 10/10 (Part of the BrickMaster package, it is a reasonable prize for an exclusive set and everything else that comes with the subscription) Overall: 9/10 (Great, but not perfect and definitely needs to be offered overseas"
p19099
aS' LEGO would make a ton of money releasing this for sale, IMO as it really is a terrific small set'
p19100
aS'Super review, thanks'
p19101
aS" Simply put, I'd have to admit this is one of the best Indy sets"
p19102
aS' And in such a small package'
p19103
aS" It's a very detailed lil' jeep, and that's why I like it"
p19104
aS" I have this too, but I don't want to open it since it's exclusive"
p19105
aS' Wait, I thought we were calling it "rown" and not "frown"'

p19111
aS" However, I had not opened it yet and I left it in my friend's car"
p19112
aS' I gave it for an above average for that cool little jeep'
p19113
aS' For an exclusive BrickMaster set, this is certainly one of the best vehicles I had ever seen'
p19114
aS' I like its construction built'
p19115
aS' If this is ever released in the main stream, I am sure it will be a hit to get a small sized Indiana Jones set'

p19125
aS" Just give us Indy's manbag, we need it for postal employees and such"
p19126
aS" As is the running joke whenever I comment on one of your reviews, I'd give this a solid 985"

aS' I had this as a little child, and whenever any of my relatives came to visit us, they brought me some Lego'
p19207
aS' Usually it was either this set or 6844 The really nice thing about this set are the alternate builds'
p19208
aS' For the low price you got a nice range of parts and cool ideas what to build with them'

p19216
aS' This set makes for an excellent addition to your jungles, deserts, outbacks, or other wild and untamed places'
p19217
aS" Set #: 6490 Theme: Outback Year Released: 1997 Piece Count: 117 Minifigs: 1 List Price: $15 (USD) Starting with an image of the box, one can conclude that this doesn't look like the Amazon at all, but rather the Outback: On the back of the box are some great alternate models, including a creative idea for a crocodile zoo scene: The instructions have the same images on the front and back: The set comes with one Outback fig, a man dressed in green with a bright red cap - I call him the Crocodile Hunter"
p19218
aS' Also included in this set is a crocodile, some bones, a skull, backpack, pan, and a few extra trans'
p19219
aS' round 1x1s'
p19220
aS" The tools are pictured on the truck: Now here's a great desert/rugged terrain truck: Ready for some 4-wheel'n fun"
p19221
aS' I love the liftable top window/sun roof and the windshield'
p19222
aS' I like the use of these colored trans'
p19223
aS' blue pieces that contrast against the yellow, rather than hide like regular clear pieces: The truck has a few hooks/clips to attach a pick, rifle, antena, and camera'
p19224
aS' Also attached is a water/oil can and an extra tire that just rests in the back section: The front end of the truck has a great winch and hook to help the truck out of hard places: Working suspension helps the vehicle travel on rough terrain: The truck is just half the fun'
p19225
aS' This set also offers a nice bridge/creek bed for the truck to drive across: I like the use of six fence/ladder pieces for the bridge'
p19226
aS' The two in the center have double open sides'
p19227
aS" Here's the left side: And the right side with a single burp as a mountain/hill: I really like the use of the tan and brown baseplates representing desert and water"
p19228
aS" The complete set as the Crocodile Hunter tries to climb back into the truck after attaching the winch: Final Thoughts: I've always liked this little set"
p19229
aS' It offers a great amount of playability with the wonderful little 4-stud wide truck and bridge scene'
p19230
aS' A few years ago, Playmobil offered a Desert Racing Theme and had this set as my favorite of the collection: Desert racing and adventures through dry creeks and rough terrain make for a great theme'

p19240
aS' I had lots of fun with this when it came out eleven years ago in 1997, the bridge scene could also be used in the Adventurers serie of 1998'

p19242
aS'A nice set to go with the outback theme'
p19243

p19249

p19309
aS' Right side'
p19310
aS' Keep an eye on that flap in the center'
p19311
aS' and we have a folding ladder! The back'
p19312
aS' Probably the weakest point of the set, apart from the dino'
p19313
aS' The turret, turned and tilted'
p19314
aS' The mechanism works extremely well, and the gun seems to work better than others for some reason (or maybe it just seems that way)'
p19315
aS' The front of the cockpit'
p19316
aS" I'm at a loss trying to figure out how those TINY windshields defend them against 40-foot mutant tyrannosaurus rexes with radioactive breath, laser eyes, and what have you"
p19317
aS' Anyway, another one of those neat steering wheels, some Viking horns, and some stickered control panels (oh yeah, this set has a good amount of stickers'

aS' Probably around 20-ish'

p19385

aS'Nice review Cobra'
p19389
aS' Thanks for sharing'
p19390
aS' I think Arctic was one of those neat themes that never really took off'
p19391
aS' I like these little poly-bag sets as they make great starters/introduction sets for themes (or) serve as a nice supplement or add/on to an existing collection'
p19392
aS" I've always liked the thick green hood piece used in the Arctic theme and have thought about using it in a SW Hoth scene"
p19393
aS" In any case, nice review! I've got an Arctic set that I built recently and will share a review soon"
p19394
aS'Here we are, my first Clone Wars set, and my first Star Wars review'
p19395
aS' Here we have the wonderful Droid gunship, one of the cheaper of the Clone Wars sets'
p19396
aS" This set is exclusive to Wal-mart, and its one of the better Exclusives out there (I'm looking at you, Twilight )"
p19397
aS' First off we have a Shot of the entire set with the Box'
p19398
aS' A random Page shot, along with pics of the Parts list'
p19399
aS' The build is split up into three sections: The Back, The cockpit, and The Missles'
p19400
aS' The back has a lot of nice dark blue plates, and is the only part of the set which uses stickers'
p19401
aS" The bottoms shows Various technic systems, which I'll get to later The cockpit has many details (Mostly guns), and the Rotating Guns are a nice touch"
p19402
aS' The cockpit can fit a battle droid, but not a Minifig'
p19403
aS" I'm not sure why a Droid would want leather though The last part is loading this baby with the missles There are four Black(small) and two Dark Bley (large) missles which are loaded in groups of three as SLS"
p19404
aS' the middle mechanism is for the missiles, and the back part with the Bionicle teeth are used ad landing gear The knob on top turns'
p19405
aS' to release the missiles on the Clones '
p19406
aS' Leftover bits and the used SS(not so D this time around) The gunship versus a time traveling Agent Charge '
p19407
aS' OVERALL Build: 8/10 A basic build, but at some points repetitive'
p19408
aS" Minifigs: 10/10 Just your basic droids, you can't go wrong"
p19409
aS' Design: 7/10 A basic design, with some Interesting techniques'
p19410
aS" Pieces: 9/10 A mix of old and new pieces, along with the return of THIS lovely piece which hasn't been seen for almost 10 years Price: 8/10 $30 for a Gunship? I'll take it! Final Verdict: 8/10 A great price for a small set like this, and It has a great bit of Swooshability"
p19411
aS'Nice review AgentRick'
p19412
aS"$30 is a good price, but TLC think thats 40 so i'll have to pass"
p19413
aS' BTW I thought this ship was supposed to hold many droids like in SW Battlefront'

aS' Back to the set, I think the colors on this are great (I love dark blue) and the design is pretty good too'

aS'Emergency Evac Set #: 6445 Theme: Town Res-Q Year Released: 1998 Piece Count: 97 Minifigs: 1 List Price: $8 (USD) In 1998, Lego introduced a new theme called Res-Q'
p19486
aS' The theme was really a quasi-Coast Guard sub-theme of Classic Town'
p19487
aS' The theme included boats, helicopters, emergency vehicles, and even a water hovercraft'
p19488
aS' Most notable was the black and yellow color combination that predominated the sets'
p19489
aS' I only picked up a couple of sets from the theme including this Emergency Evacuation vehicle that I consider a van'
p19490
aS' I never got into the theme, but looking back at these sets, I have gained a better appreciation for their value in Classic Town'
p19491
aS" Let's take a look at 6445 in greater detail"
p19492
aS' Starting with the box: The back of the box providing a few alternate models: And similar imagery on the instructions: The set includes one small sheet of decals for the van: 6445 has one Res-Q minifig that I find pretty nice'
p19493
aS" I like the neon orange reflectors: He has a nice printed backside with the word RES-Q prominently displayed: This little set includes an abundance of tools: A black walkie-talkie is not pictured Here's the emergency van: I like the back section that has a nice winch with turning wheel and a few hooks for tools: Here's the minifig pulling the grappling hook for some Res-Q action"
p19494
aS" This is my favorite part of this set: The van isn't too fancy but has some neat features: While I like the blue windshield piece for maybe space sets, I'm not really fond of its use for the van: The van has no steering wheel, but rather two levers for steering: On the top of the vehicle are two emergency alarms and some extra lights: The back of the van has a large opening piece that allows wide access to the back section: It comfortably fits a long gurney/stretcher: Here's the driver resting on the gurney: He should never have tried to pick up the gurney without a 2nd Res-Q minifig"
p19495
aS' And a shot of the back section without the gurney: Lastly, a picture of the complete set: Final Thoughts Res-Q is really a neat theme that has great play value for kids'
p19496
aS" While it's not one of my more favorite town sub-themes, it does offer some nice pieces and an abundance of black and yellow pieces"
p19497
aS' I think a few of the Res-Q sets go nicely with the Divers theme released one year earlier in 1997'
p19498
aS' I had a chance to purchase the largest set of the theme, 6479 Emergency Response Center, at half the price, but passed back in the late 90s'
p19499
aS" I'd be interested in finding out what other EB members think of this set and the Res-Q theme"
p19500
aS'Wow, and people complain that a military type line would be to violent'
p19501
aS" Here we have half dead soilders and a space shuttle bombing people with severed skeleton heads! i have to say this is the first time i've heard of this theme"
p19502
aS' I like the colors as most have pointed out'
p19503
aS' The base plate is preety cool two'
p19504
aS' Could use it to moc up some garages'
p19505
aS'I am a proud owner of this set'
p19506
aS" Like others, I got it discounted and couldn't resit the parts pack"
p19507
aS' This is the type of lego sets that bothers me'
p19508
aS' When you look at it now, you\'d be tempted to say "hey not bad", but at the same time, some years ago, it wasn\'t good enough to buy it full price'
p19509
aS' I was kinda disappointed because usually sets using that kinda baseplates are excellent (castle, paradisa), and this one is just "ok"'
p19510
aS' One really minus point would be the lack of any opponent faction in the set'
p19511
aS"That's IT! Thanks for the review but now you make me want to build my own one! THANKS A LOT! ON a more serious note, I really like this set and have always wished to aquire it"
p19512
aS' I have two broken Tie Interceptors, so this should be a easy build'
p19513
aS' And as someone in the pirate forum, I think, said, It would be a great baseplate for building cave to hide the booty! Thanks PMG and welcome!'
p19514
aS"Thanks for the welcome everyone! Though I'm still wondering where the Drone Minion/Commander idea came from"
p19515
aS'Thanks for the review PMJ '
p19516
aS' I like the play value in this set even if I dont own it '
p19517
aS' The way the orbs are put into the rocket is awesome and I really like it, but at the end the set have some lack of detail '

aS'Set: 7680 - The Twilight Theme: Star Wars Year Released: 2008 Piece Count: 882 Price: $AUD149'
p19519
aS'99 (or $159'
p19520
aS'99 if you buy at TRU!), 99'
p19521
aS'99 Euro, $US99'
p19522
aS'99 Pity the Twilight'
p19523
aS" When rumours of the set name first circulated, speculation was swift: 'Twilight - that suggests something sleek, elegant and mysterious"
p19524
aS"' Anticipation mounted! Fan-frenzy grew! Finally a pic leaked! And the verdict was"
p19525
aS" 'clunk-a-dunk' It appeared that in the Jedi off-season, Anakin was running something that looked like an intergalactic garbage scow, like Roger Wilco in the old Sierra Space Quest PC games"
p19526
aS' Blocky and bley seemed to sum it up'
p19527
aS' The set went from being one of the most anticipated to one of the least liked of 2008 pretty much instantly'
p19528
aS" It's a mark of that dislike that in the EB Clone Wars review feeding frenzy nobody has so far even bothered to post a few pics of this set even 2 weeks after it's official release! I'm here to redress that imbalance now and find out if 7680 is as horrendous as everyone originally thought Part 1: Box & Parts Front of the box"
p19529
aS" It's quite big, same size as the 10144 Sandcrawler"
p19530
aS" Annoyingly, it's the old style with the perforated corners that you have to tear to flip open the lid"
p19531
aS' Detail of the back, showing set functions: Interior of the box - a lot of wasted space'
p19532
aS' The set comes with 2 instruction manuals, each 76 pages'
p19533
aS" And no DSS sheet! Polybags! 13 of 'em"
p19534
aS' Like the other CW sets, these are unnumbered'
p19535
aS' Parts ahoy! You can tell at a glance that this set is comparable to the AT-TE, although there a large proportion of the 800+ parts here are technic pins and bley plates'
p19536
aS' Part 2: Minifigs and Build The set comes with 4 figs (or 3'
p19537
aS'5, depending on how you look at Rotta ): Anakin, Ahsoka, R2-D2 and Rotta'
p19538
aS" Very disappointing that there's nothing new here for such a high-priced exclusive, although I guess it is maybe movie accurate"
p19539
aS" Anyway, to paraphrase the wise Patsy Stone, you can never have enough hats, shoes or new Anakin/ Ahsoka hairpieces so it's not too bad"
p19540
aS' Pics of the build in progress'
p19541
aS" A quarter of the way through we can already see that this is one of those 'convoluted technic frames with some plates affixed' type builds: Half-way and the smaller wing is added: At the three quarter mark the giant single wing is added: And voila! Done! The final quarter is a race to attach all the exterior surfaces and details such as the engine and escape pod"
p19542
aS' The build itself is a mixed blessing'
p19543
aS' It is VERY technic oriented'
p19544
aS" I'm not a Technic-ally minded person and don't really have much of a conceptual grasp of how everything functions until I see the final result, so I find these type of builds a little uninteresting"
p19545
aS' Pins, axles and beams? Give me bricks any day! I really liked the 7676 Gunship and the 7679 Fighter Tank although they do contain some technic framework, they are largely brick-built ships, especially the Fighter Tank which is solid, largely brick built and full of neat functions'
p19546
aS" The 7680 build is one of the most technicy builds I've ever undergone in a System set, akin to the experience of building the 10178 Motorised AT-AT"
p19547
aS' But whereas with that set you could understand the need for a technic framework (the thing walks!) a lot of this seemed excessive'
p19548
aS' Yes, the Twilight does some have nice functions, and it is so large and heavy it does need a strong skeleton, but to me it just seemed too much and aesthetics have been sacrificed for (in some cases limited) functionality'
p19549
aS' I will discuss in more detail what I mean as I look at different parts of the set'
p19550
aS' On the upside, this is the only non-symmetric set in the CW range, so at least every page and new step brings something different! Part 3: A Closer View Close-up of the main body of the ship: Front-on'
p19551
aS' It is well-designed how the figs appear in line of sight (unlike the 6211 where Jabba and Leia were photoshopped in to the box art)'
p19552
aS" Don't ask what Rotta is doing out of the line of vision there"
p19553
aS' Some things are better left unsaid'
p19554
aS' Side view, showing escape pod (smaller cylinder) and drive: Top view: Rear view, showing back door'
p19555
aS' The rear deck is huge'
p19556
aS' Indeed, the whole ship is huge'
p19557
aS' Oddly so'
p19558
aS" I don't know if this is movie-scale or not, but I've seen people complain the fighter tank is too big (!) and that set is nothing compared to this baby! It's wider than the Gunship and in wingspan and length is almost bigger"
p19559
aS" Here's a few pics next to an MTT for comparison"
p19560
aS' Pretty big, hey? Turning to the dark side must be good for business'
p19561
aS' Even if all you can buy is a rusty old beast like this, at least you could comfortably squash pretty much every vehicle in the opposing fleet just by landing on it'
p19562
aS' At least now you can see why it costs so much'
p19563
aS' The official pics make it look smaller, somehow, by truncating the rear and wing'
p19564
aS" The ship is in fact so big you can't really pose it with wings open - only hold it that way"
p19565
aS' I was too lazy to build a giant trans-clear support strut so propped it up on a shoebox instead'
p19566
aS' The wing opens very neatly - you push a technic lever and a pin holding the bottom wing pops out quite smoothly'
p19567
aS' The little top turret can move up and down as well to get the full cross-shaped effect'
p19568
aS' Part 4: Features and Functions The front cockpit folds down very neatly, although I find the build here a little weak'
p19569
aS' Whee! It goes all the way down to the floor'
p19570
aS' The mechanism is cool, but it takes up an awful lot of space'
p19571
aS" Basically the whole front is cockpit and all Lego could manage for controls is 2 printed 1x2 tiles as well (not pictured here, but they're attached to the part that folds up and down)"
p19572
aS" There's also no way for anyone to get in or out of the cockpit"
p19573
aS' And an invisible windscreen! Technology has come a long way'
p19574
aS' Side view, looking from wing'
p19575
aS' R2D2 is here as well as some tools'
p19576
aS' You can also glimpse here one of the main problems with the set'
p19577
aS" Despite being a huge boxy ship, there's no interior! None! The Twilight doesn't even have an internal floor"
p19578
aS' All the room inside is taken up by the landing gear which folds up - again, a clever function but it really gets in the way of the set as a whole'
p19579
aS" Kudos to the designer for coming up with stable, working landing gear, but too clever by half if it means that this giant ship ends up basically being one tiny cockpit and a rear door at the back that doesn't lead to any interior! Underside showing landing gear when open: And closed - when the wing is folded down, the gear is locked in place, which is pretty neat"
p19580
aS' Space-consuming, but neat'
p19581
aS' The rear section'
p19582
aS' The door, when opened, reveals an orange cupboard and a tow-line, as Ahsoka uses in the box art'
p19583
aS' The door clicks into place when open and can be released by pressing the technic bit at the top'
p19584
aS" Again, clever, but pointless as you can't get inside! Ahsoka can indulge in a little recreational bungee-jumping if she so wishes: The rear deck is so large that it is wasted just being used so Ahsoka can bungee-jump"
p19585
aS' I came up with a much better use for it'
p19586
aS' Outdoor garden! Despite having one roboticised hand, Anakin was still quite the green thumb'
p19587
aS' And his light-saber was very useful as a hedge trimmer'
p19588
aS' So much so that he set up a side business between Rotta-rescue missions'
p19589
aS" Here's a promotional postcard: A few other bits and pieces"
p19590
aS' The gun turret on the enormous mega-wing can only hold one flick fire missile at a time (you do get two, though ) Rear engine detail: The escape pod sits neatly on the side and is basically built the same way as the Gunship bacta tank: The pod sits on these tehcnic pins and is held in place by the light bley parts: Part 5: In conclusion The Twilight is a huge ship, with a huge amount of great functions - folding wing, folding cockpit, rear door, escape pod, retractable landing gear! But this functionality comes at a price - a very complex technic build and zip interior'
p19591
aS' Compared with the Gunship, for example, which is stuffed with nooks and crannies, the Twilight suffers in this respect'
p19592
aS" I also think it is just too large - it doesn't really fit with the other craft and vehicles released with the Clone Wars line"
p19593
aS' I may be wrong and it is movie-accurate, but when you have all the CW sets laid out it does stick out like a poor thumb'
p19594
aS' Part selection is OK, with the only interesting things being a few dark orange plates, the orange cupboard and the big trans-neon green radar dish'
p19595
aS" Don't get me wrong, I don't think this is a bad set at all"
p19596
aS" It's just the other CW sets are so sweet! I would say it's an above average set in a field crammed with excellent ones"
p19597
aS" If you're a completist, buy it, but if for example you'd rather invest in another AT-TE to upgrade your Republic Army, then I couldn't really disagree with you either And to finish on a light note, I'd like to remind you that you do get another Ahsoka hairpiece, which can be used for all sorts of things"
p19598
aS" Ugha warrior upgrade: Dr Inferno hair transplant: And finally, attack of the deadly blue-ringed octopus, native to Australia's beaches and oceans! Thanks for reading!"
p19599
aS'Another outstanding review by the "awesome set reviewer"! I enjoyed reading this review very much and I felt that you have redress Twilight in an approriate manner'
p19600
aS' I have very mixed feeling about this set especially with its design'
p19601
aS' It seemed I will need to watch the Clone Wars movie in the theatre before I compared with it'
p19602
aS' Most of the time, when this LEGO set is used in a movie, you will tend to compare it and what is the actual purpose for Twilight, same as the rest of the SW vehicles and aircraft'
p19603
aS' For a high price like this, I can actually top up a little more and get the AT-TE, with the same batch of minifigs plus Commander Rex'
p19604
aS' If there is a special figure such as the V19 Torrent (Clone Pliot), it will be a much ideal scenario'
p19605
aS' At the moment, I have not bring in any Clone War sets into my collection, and I am quite sure Twilight is not in my priority list especially when I am not a full-pledged Star War collectors or I have strong intentions to complete the entire range in this recent release'
p19606
aS' Therefore, I need to prioritise my purchase, and likely to get two RGS, since that is my favourite ship in Clone War era'
p19607
aS' I am not comparing it with RGS'
p19608
aS' Both sets defintely have their pros and cons'
p19609
aS' Oh, I love that postcard you made'
p19610
aS' Certainly looks very nice! svelte_corps, thanks for doing up this superb detailed review which had given "Twilight" the neccessary attention it should have'
p19611
aS'Really awesome review svelte_corps '
p19612
aS' You did a really complete and in-depth review of this beast and with your nice pics is really enjoyable reading your review, so congrats '
p19613
aS' I like this ship even if it looks so bulky but I need to buy first other sets, so maybe this beast will be landing in my collection the next year (Or this one if I am lucky )'
p19614
aS' I can just ask for something, can you post a pic of all your clone wars sets together with this one (all the sets in one pic, not many pics with this an each set ) please '

p19618
aS' I think a lot of people feel the same way - there was so much good stuff to get in the first wave that this is probably a backburner set for a lot of people, and some are probably waiting to see the movie to see how prominently it features'
p19619
aS" I will try and take a pic with some other CW sets, I don't have all of them though and some need to be reassembled as I built them on holiday and then had to pack them away I do think this line of sets has been the best SW Lego wave released though"
p19620
aS' All of the recent releases have been amazing in their own way'
p19621
aS'Thanks for the review'
p19622
aS' Now I thinnk I will buy this set'
p19623
aS' BTW, I really like what you did to the back'
p19624
aS' I might do the same to mine'
p19625
aS"Wow certainly much bigger than I would have thought, thanks for the great review and pictures =] Well for some reason i was drawn to this set, but with the lack of interior and quite a bit of technics, i think I'll pass, or at least get the At-te first! Thanks again!"
p19626
aS'I read the Visual Guide recently and learned a bit more about the Twilight'
p19627
aS" I won't get into spoilers but it seems that the ship becomes a sort of endearing family van for the characters which is neat"
p19628
aS' Big bulky, uncool, but it gets you from one place to another'
p19629
aS' If it factors into more than just the 90 minute film, I may pick this up'
p19630
aS" It seems that there's room for a lot of personality in this ship once you see the film"
p19631
aS' It is a Corellian freighter smuggling spice for the Hutts'
p19632
aS" That's cool right?"

p19640
aS"This is probably the best review I've ever seen"
p19641
aS" Why? It put the set in context with people's changing thoughts about it"
p19642
aS' It commented on the box, why do such expensive sets have such ordinary boxes? The photography was outstanding'
p19643
aS' Every issue that a builder could have with it was discussed in a calm and rational manner'
p19644
aS' I have the same issues with technic structured sets, and svelte_corps summed up my feelings on this beautifully'
p19645
aS' This was an even handed review, so thoughtful'
p19646
aS' Finally, you gotta love a bit of humour in a review, that gardenis brilliant'
p19647
aS" I was probably never going to get this set anyway but it sets a new world's best standard for reviews"
p19648
aS" I strongly encourage anyone that's going to review a set to have a good look at this to see how well it can be done"
p19649
aS' Thanks for the magnificent review!'
p19650
aS'Oh no! Anakin has gone over to the green side of the force! Well, I guess someone had to review the Clunkadunk eventually'
p19651
aS' And you did a good job at it, svelte corps! I liked the punchline with the Ahsoka-hairpiece swapping'
p19652
aS' The "Ugha warrior upgrade" is an interesting way of creating male Togrutas'
p19653
aS" And Ahsoka looks even hotter with Inferno's hair! Matteo Kenobi, on Aug 11 2008, 09:30 PM, said: If i am really impressed with it in the film i suppose that would change things, but i will have to see =] I wouldn't count on it"
p19654
aS' Spoiler After its first flight, the Twilight will crash and burn! Wookieepedia says so, and you can see it in one of the trailers'
p19655
aS' So, I guess the Twilight will stay mostly unbought'
p19656
aS' Poor Clunkadunk'
p19657
aS'Thanks a lot for a very nice and entertaining review! Your photos were really nice and there have been some reviews lately that have such blurry pics'

p19663
aS' handle your camera! I think this ship is underrated, it is really nice! I love the playing features like landing gear and back door, perhaps just cause I had to get along with so called landing gears in the past, that did not work at all (7140 for example'
p19664
aS' And I simply LOVE that there is space inside'
p19665
aS' You said there is not really some cause of the landing gear mechanism, but it seems it should be easily fixed'
p19666
aS' Do you think there is enough space to put some plates over the landing gear and add some beds, kitchen und TV? I think this set is so perfect to mod it into a Clone Wars mobile home, your back garden ist just perfect for this'
p19667
aS' I prefer this over the AT-TE and over a 2nd gunship! Thanks a lot for the review!'

aS" It does have that homely feel! There is room inside with technic beams to lay plates etc on, the only issue is that it's kind of fiddly to access"
p19672
aS' You could do it from either the side door or rear door though, maybe move that tow line at the back'
p19673
aS' I have to say, it is a set that grows on you'
p19674
aS'Thank you svelte_corps for the review! I like the inside, nice and cosey! I also like your little garden! For me, this put the twilight different in a better perspective than my first perspective of the twilight'

aS' I voted outstanding'
p19676
aS' Greets The-Force!'
p19677
aS'I will not be picking this one up'
p19678
aS' The main thing is that it simply looks akward'
p19679
aS' It is big and bulky, and seems to have random pieces on it with not reall streamline feel to it'
p19680
aS' I also agree that for an exclusive that it $100, it needs more than just 3'
p19681
aS'5 mini figures'
p19682
aS' Anikan and Ashoka and Rotta already come in the AT-TE, which is cheaper and has more figures'
p19683
aS' R2-D2 is a figure that I am sure everybody has at least 4 or 5 of'
p19684
aS' For that kind of money, I expect something with at least one unique figure, and more than 4'
p19685
aS' I also want just a cleaner and better designed set'
p19686
aS' This is probably the letdown of the collection so far'

aS" As for the price, I'd say 7090 is surprisingly cheap!"
p19781
aS'Very good set'
p19782
aS" Indeed the possibility to alter the knight's appearance hugely boosts the value! Very smart thinking of TLC"
p19783
aS' Got one of these so far, but if I ever do a Castle-related comic or animation, this will be the set I buy tons of'
p19784
aS"Argh! What I was typing kept getting deleted by my stupid keyboard!!!!! On Topic: This looks like a great little set, I could use a few of these, but I haven't seen any at a local store"

aS'99 USD Pieces: 54 Release: 2007 The Box: And as the other two sets reviewd so far (7009 and 5615), this one has a fitting box that is too easily snatched from the shelf and put into your shopping cart'
p19792
aS" - Not sure it's a great thing"
p19793
aS'too expensive in the end :D The Crossbow Attack Cart: The cart is a neat little build that actually works'
p19794
aS' And for once we\'re not given that awful technic launcher, but a "build-it" launcher! It actually works just fine for it\'s purpose'
p19795
aS' The addition of two crossbows makes it worth buying'
p19796
aS' Never can get enought weapons for the evergrowing Crownie army'
p19797
aS" The Figs: Oddly I've not taken any pics of the figs and therefore I'll illustrate using the S@H pic"
p19798
aS' The figs are great'
p19799
aS' I love the silver helmets and in this set you get 2 crownies and a skeleton plus a white skeleton horse'
p19800
aS" That's a lot of figs for a set this size"
p19801
aS' A true army builder'
p19802
aS' Thumbs up for that'
p19803
aS' The All in All verdict: Another small, yet super set in the Castle theme'
p19804
aS' I bought several of these to make a fine little army'
p19805
aS" It's cheap and often found on sale! I can hardly resist buying it when I see it KimT"
p19806
aS'Hard to find (in Italian shops); I had a friend buying one for meas soon as the set was available'
p19807
aS" I always wanted another one, so while in Switzerland (see KimT's 7009 review for the full story), I bought two"
p19808
aS" For 5 uros you get two knights, a skeleton and a skeleton horse, some hand weapons and a shooting device (please remember, don't aim at the eyes!) Just great"
p19809
aS"This little bugger brought me back from my Dark Ages! As a movie fan, I just couldn't resist the thought of making an animation with living LEGO skeletons (I'm referring to Ray Harryhausen's work on the classic Jason and the Argonauts here)"
p19810
aS' Buying the Indy sets stopped me from getting a lot more Castle sets'
p19811
aS' Though in time I added the Final Joust, the Wizard and the impulse Knight to my collection, as well as buying more unique figs (King, Princess) from expensive Castle sets off Bricklink'
p19812
aS' So yeah'
p19813
aS' Great little set'
p19814
aS" Two crownies, a skeleton and a skeletal horse, you just cannot resist that! Even if you hadn't been buying LEGO for 5 years"
p19815
aS" As far as I'm concerned, this set is One For The Ages! I love it!"
p19816
aS'This is an awesome set in my opinion'
p19817
aS' I scraped my crossbows for MOCing recently, but the set is still an amazing army builder'
p19818
aS' For the price for the SW battlepacks, which have 4 minifigs and a cheap vehicle, you get 4 knights ( this is 2 sets to equal the price of a BP ), 2 Skellys and 2 skelly horses, plus 4 crossbows, 4 good wheels, and some other good dark blue and brown pieces for my ever expanding castle town'
p19819
aS' Great Buy'

p19822
aS'99 USD Pieces: 62 Release: 2007 The Box: And yet again TLG has put the bricks in a box, that somehow corresponds with the amount of bricks in it'

aS' The Castle theme has got well designed boxes :) The whole set (build): 2 knights, jousting fence and weapon rack'
p19824
aS' The Weapons Rack: Another great addition of weapons'
p19825
aS' Flail, halberd and skeleton scimitar'
p19826
aS' Super weapons for those close encounter melee battles fought when tipped off the horse : :grin:P The Jousting Fence: Not much to say'
p19827
aS" It's a fence"
p19828
aS" Simple, yet it serves it's purpose very well"
p19829
aS' The Crown Knight: Gotta love that guy'
p19830
aS' He looks like nothing can hurt him'
p19831
aS' He even got a selfsufficient smile on his face'
p19832
aS" I'm sure he's convinced that no skeleton can defeat him"
p19833
aS" Also the horse, it's barding and the headcover looks awesome"
p19834
aS' A great old school sword and the ever cool normannic shield'
p19835
aS' What could possibly go wrong for this knight? The helmet I really love'
p19836
aS" IMO it's a lot better than the old knight helmets (see review of 5615 The Knight for a pic of one of those)"
p19837
aS" The Skeleton Knight: The black skeleton horse ROCKS! I love that design and in black it's even badder than than the white version"
p19838
aS' The shield reeks of dread and the knight is one bad skeleton on the rampage'
p19839
aS" I do find that the helmet is a little off! I'd rather have a black knights helmet instead"
p19840

aS' The All in All verdict: This is another great army builder set'
p19842
aS' It holds a lot of great weapons, some cool minifigs and great pieces'

p19847
aS' I finally decided to buy it on the net (2x , plus some other sets) and those morons at the Custom charged me quite a lot'
p19848
aS' After I bought it, while waiting for it to arrive, I found out it was available in a store in Switzerland, not far away from home'
p19849
aS" That's for the storytelling"
p19850
aS' As for the set, I thought it was great, and still think so'
p19851
aS' A good army builder (as quite a few sets in the 2007/2008 castle line), and a time traveller (6021 being my first Lego Castle set ever)'

aS' Rating? 5/5! Edited by The Cobra, 13 August 2008 - 09:04 PM'
p19853
aS'Lovely set'
p19854
aS' Nice collection of weapons'
p19855
aS" Cool horse-accesoires for the white knight, cool black skeletal horse on the dark knight's side"
p19856
aS' Loving the printed armours of both knights! And, as opposed to KimT apparently, I really dig the black helmet'
p19857
aS" I feel there's a Lord of the Rings-flavour to it with those curves"
p19858
aS' Well designed!'
p19859
aS"Another small set my local Target doesn't have"
p19860
aS" They don't have the best castle selection, they only really have dwarven mines and Castle Seiges"
p19861
aS" I'll buy this if I see it there though, because it looks like a great little set"
p19862
aS' I could use the awesome knight, and a skeleton that has a regular body so he looks like he is in armor!!!!!'
p19863
aS'I should really get one more of these for the figures, shields, and weapons'
p19864
aS' This set is the only one with the scythe in pearl-grey, by the way'
p19865
aS' "The only thing that puzzles me is; why would a Crown Knight joust a Skeleton?" Good question'
p19866
aS' For a joust to make sense, this set should contain two human knights instead -- which would be fine with me so long as they had differing armour and colours'

p19868
aS"I'm not a huge fan of this set but it is a great way to nab a fully mounted knight complete with a very attractive barding"
p19869
aS" Given that in prior years it wasn't possible to get a barded horse in such a small set, this set is actually a decent way to build a mounted cavalry for your kingdom"
p19870
aS" Looking at bricklink, it would probably cost as much to buy the Knight, horse and weapons separately, and that doesn't take into account the skeleton or the extra bricks"
p19871
aS" Despite my indifference to this set, I actually have purchased four of them in the past year simply because there isn't a cheaper way to acquire a mounted knight"

p19876
aS' Feel free to comment on the review and/or set also'
p19877
aS'This set is a great little bundle, the kitted out knight, skellie knight, weapons, and the few bricks for the fence and weapon rack'
p19878
aS' The Castle 07 barding here is very nice, indeed the colour scheme of the new Castle guys is great IMO, the light blue and blue work nicely together and against the grey background'
p19879
aS" I don't really like the pearl grey helmet - it would be nicer in metallic silver like the visor I think"
p19880
aS" Interesting comment re: the skellie helmet - I guess black normal knight's helmet with visor would be quite nice for him"
p19881
aS' I got this set as part of the Complete Castle Collection from S@H'
p19882
aS" However, I have extras of all the smaller sets and Skeleton Tower, except I don't have another one of this set"
p19883
aS" It's on my list of sets to buy"
p19884
aS" Unfortunately it wasn't on S@H for Ireland when I was making later orders - quite an odd omission"
p19885
aS" Also last year Castle '07 was exclusive to Argos (UK catalogue retailer) who only had three sets (not the joust)"
p19886
aS" I should see if the local toy store has it now though, as they did stock some '07 Castle in addition to '08 at the start of the year"
p19887
aS" I think small sets like this should be well stocked in shops for a year or two - it surely doesn't do their sales much good to be so sporadically available? Sorry, turned into a bit of a ramble"
p19888
aS" Anyways, the point is that this set is good enough I'd pick up another"
p19889
aS' The Cobra: that sucks about customs'

p19895
aS' Thanks '
p19896
aS' The set is average'
p19897
aS" It's useful for picking up a few knights, but I'm not really partial to the skeleton"
p19898
aS' The idea of a knight and a skeleton tilting just strikes me as being odd'
p19899
aS' My biggest issue with the current castle line is that most sets force you to purchase a mixture of skeletons/knights orcs/knights orcs/dwarves etc'
p19900
aS' This is fine for those of you who love your fantasy, however it makes the line a bit underwhelming for the rest of us'
p19901
aS' Still, as mentioned earlier the set does have an upside so it is worth a purchase'
p19902
aS' The review on the other hand is aces with great photos and a detailed description of the set and its contents'
p19903
aS' Nice work'
p19904
aS'You know what I think this set has? Charm'
p19905
aS' Lots of it'
p19906
aS" I'm not a big fan of castle, having very few sets, all of them spanning different nations/armies, but I couldn't resist this set"
p19907
aS' And while not obvious at first, it really is backwards compatible with every castle set with a horse in it'
p19908
aS' Nonetheless, I think this set is great'
p19909
aS" It's simple, cheap and has charm"
p19910
aS" That's good enough for me"
p19911
aS' Plus it has that fantastic grinning knight and the black skeleton horse'

p19923
aS' Pictures are clear and show each of the pieces in great detail'
p19924
aS' I agree with your comments as well'
p19925
aS" I'm a bit curious, does the knight's helm have a hole for plume? I've been debating whether to purchase this set or not"
p19926
aS" I'm not a big fan of horses so I'll likely barely use them, but I do like the unique minifigs, weapon rack/weapons, and the fact that the divider has a few useful pieces that can be added to other sets"
p19927
aS" However, I just don't feel the set is worth $8 when compared to Crossbow attack and the Knight's Catapult unless the buyer is really wanting some mounted minifigs"
p19928
aS' Luckily, Amazon just lowered their price of this set from $8 to $6 (along with another 20% if using Bill Me Later'
p19929

p19935

p19941
aS' Now, I really like this set and it was the first one I dug into when I got my collection in the mail'
p19942
aS' It has a great selection of equipment for good or evil figures and the barding for the horse is outstanding'
p19943
aS' My only wish was for one of the long chrome swords for the knights'
p19944
aS' I think the new knights with the tall shield and chrome sword look excellent on foot and on horseback'
p19945
aS' It would definitely be neat to revisit this set with another human knight instead of the skeleton'

aS"INDEXED Name: Holiday Villa Theme: LEGO System / Town Year: 1988 Pieces: 197 Minifigs: 2 Price: USD ? There were quite a few sets in the 1980's that weren't sold in the US"
p19948
aS" I remember reading once that it was because they contained wine glasses and TLG felt they wouldn't be able to market a toy that encourage the drinking of alcohol"
p19949
aS' This set was one of them'
p19950
aS' I remember seeing this in a catalog that came with a Fabuland set and wondering what it was and where I could get one'
p19951
aS' I wrote to LEGO and got an overseas catalog which had the Futuron 6990 Monorail Transport System in it before it was available in the US'
p19952
aS' I was amazed'
p19953
aS' I ended up buying 6349 Holiday Villa from that catalog but, for some reason, gave it to my best friend for his birthday'
p19954
aS" I've always wanted this set and finally bought it from Bricklink this year"
p19955
aS' My purchase included everything except the box'
p19956
aS' I really like the boxes'
p19957
aS" But, in lieu of a boxshot, here is the instruction manual: I imagine this was the image on the front of the box: The parts One of the things that appealed to me about this set is it's abundance of rare parts"
p19958
aS' This base plate is an excellent piece and was only available in two sets: Classic LEGO telephone: Technically, these blue windows 1 x 4 x 5 windows are only available in this set, according to Bricklink'
p19959
aS' It was available in different form (with and without fixed glass, trans blue glass) in other sets'
p19960
aS' Regardless this size and color window is rare and the blue door was only available in 4 sets'
p19961
aS" This was a huge selling point for me as I'm a window monkey"
p19962
aS" Never heard that term? It's like a parts monkey (a collector who buys mulitples of sets just for parts or large lots of bulk from BL and sorts them into bins) but just for windows"
p19963
aS" Tell your friends I coined the term: These sloped windows have endless possibilities in many themes (maybe not with the curtain decals applied) but are another great rare part that appears in this set: The build Remember this piece? I'd like to see a badass Agents car built on this car base! : I am a fan of the six-wide car but I see the appeal of the four wide"
p19964
aS" It has a very nostalgic feel to it: There's no denying that this is a beauty of classic LEGO 4-wide cars: This set comes with two mini-figures, one of which appears to be a painter"
p19965
aS" Classic vintage LEGO figs: Onto the house which begins with the basic floorplan: A kitchen that's open to the rest of the house and a little oven and hood vent is one of my favorite touches"
p19966
aS" It's one thing to throw an oven into a house set, but the designer of this set made it a cool part of the architecture of the house which gives it a unique feel: The completed first floor and carport: I do wish the sides of the roof were white with a little overhang like an actual roof"
p19967
aS" This method of white on bottom, red on top looks more like a child's drawing than a real house"
p19968

p20088
aS' Look how confident she is, with those witty eyes of her'
p20089
aS' I am very sure she will survived the course of her entire journey'
p20090
aS" Raft's Design This is a very simple design, with just a big piece of wooden plank and a couple of logs tied together on the side, and it is ready to take it down to the water"
p20091
aS' Speaking of some real adventure, do you dare to take this raft in the unknown waters? There is a small holding area, where she is able to place her critical equipment to ensure her safety throughout the journey'
p20092
aS' Bottom of the raft Excellent range of equipment This set actually provides very good range of equipment'
p20093
aS' There is a pair of oars, hammer, life vest and backpack'
p20094
aS' The most wonderful piece of equipment is the pair of dynamites'
p20095
aS' First of all, they are printed'
p20096
aS' Next, they can be used in Wild West or any playing possibilites which involved in explosives'
p20097
aS' This is a very good impulse set to stock up these accessories'
p20098
aS' I wondered what she need to use these dynamites for? Her Extreme Team black jacket is very nicely designed, with their logo "X" or another way of saying "Xtreme"'
p20099
aS' I find the green arms and black jacket matched pretty well, with that blue cap'
p20100
aS' Front view Relaxing herself, listening to the calm sea To summarise, this is one of the better impulse sets ever produced'
p20101
aS' It comes with a simple raft with tons of good accessories, and a very cheap way to obtain dynamites'
p20102
aS' In fact, these are my only 2 piece in my entire collection'
p20103
aS' Somehow, this set managed to find its way to my collection in my Dark Age, and I am very pleased to have this'

p20117
aS' perhaps an easy way to go fishing or perhaps to clear a rock in the forseen future? Or is it that she is just a suicide bomber attacking the white house water (joke not ment to be tasteless or offensive to those lost in the act of terrosim, greatest respect to those who have lost loved ones) Great Review, Regards Cpt'

p20122

p20123
aS'Overall, an excellent set concerning the price range'
p20124
aS' Nice review, WhiteFang!'
p20125
aS'Good set, I laughed at the dynamite, but not as much as that axe'
p20126
aS' not many trees on the rapids'
p20127
aS" Looks like she's got more than dynamite to cause havoc in the harbour"

p20133
aS" The raft's design is quite good"
p20134

aS'Aerial Recovery Set #: 6462 Theme: Town Res-Q Year Released: 1998 Piece Count: 201 Minifigs: 3 List Price: $25 (USD) My personal favorite of the Res-Q theme released in 1998 was this helicopter, 6462 Aerial Recovery'
p20140
aS' The set offered a pretty modern helicopter, raft, three-wheeler, rescue gurney and net, and three figs including a diver'
p20141
aS' The set is action-packed and offers a high degree of play value'
p20142
aS' Starting with the box, front side and back: Front Back I always liked the rough ocean/sea water pictured in the boxart'
p20143
aS' The same image from the front of the box appears on the cover of the instructions: But the back of the instructions picture a plain view of the copter: One sticker sheet with a few "Res-Q" stickers is included, mainly for the tail section of the helicopter: Interestingly, the set includes three figures, one being a diver'
p20144
aS' What I always found strange is the inclusion of an "X-Treme Team" Diver who has the logo on his torso (although it\'s a very nice fig): Back shot: I think this was my first set with a Lego three-wheeler'
p20145
aS" I always liked it a lot: The set includes a yellow raft (also found in the Divers sets) and some scuba gear: NOTE: the raft has a black piece in it's center for lifting up by the helicopter For sea and emergent rescue, a gurney can also be lifted by the helicopter: The set also includes a net with hook to lift the three-wheeler and other items"
p20146
aS" An extra string pulls the net closed: Here's a shot of the helicopter: The front section has a large trans"
p20147
aS' blue piece enclosing the cockpit: Inside is a printed radar slope: A smaller trans'
p20148
aS" blue piece appears a bit higher for access to the middle section of the helicopter and/or a small storage area: In the middle section is an place for the gurney and a box for storing some of the adventure gear: Here's a picture showing the gurney: On the side is a pulley mechanism that swings to the right when not in use: On the opposite side is the winch to raise and lower the grappling hook: Here's a picture of an open storage box: I like the tail section with propeller: Decal is not shown Here's another shot of the copter from a different angle: And the final image, the entire set: Final Thoughts Personally, I think this is pretty nice set"
p20149
aS' I like the thought of using the helicopter to rescue people at sea using the working winch'
p20150
aS' Extras like the trike/three-wheeler and the rescue net make the set even more fun'
p20151
aS' Hope you enjoy this Res-Q review'
p20152
aS"Thanks for this review TheBrickster, i also have this set and think it's one of the best helicopters TLG made in the 90's"
p20153
aS" It's quite big and has got place for 2 minifigs in the cockpit"
p20154
aS" I also like the fact that there's a victim included in form of the x-treme diver, which also is a theme i always loved as a kid"
p20155
aS' Do you have any other Res-Q sets left to review? It would be an honour for me to also do a review of one or more sets which are left, but unfortunately i got not much time at the moment'

p20157
aS' This and the Emergency Evac set are the only Re-Q sets I have'
p20158
aS' I would encourage you to share a review as you have done some very nice reviews'
p20159
aS"Cool, then i think i'll do a review of 6451 River Response later today or tomorrow, stay tuned!"
p20160
aS'I got this set as well as a Res-Q hovercraft'
p20161
aS' This set is cool because of all the accessories and it come with a X team guy'
p20162
aS' Your set is also in much better condition than mine'
p20163
aS' You have made me decide to rebuild it'
p20164
aS' Another great review TheBrickster'
p20165
aS' Keep up the good work'
p20166
aS'Looks like a nice helicoptor, I love the 2 cockpits'
p20167
aS" I love the diver's head, I really need one of those"
p20168
aS'This helicopter is so cool and I agreed with you that this is a high playablity set'
p20169
aS" It's not common to see such a big scale helicopter which has two cockpits back then"
p20170
aS' The color scheme works well for me'
p20171
aS' With so much features such as the lowering of the grappling hook, storage box, storing of the gurney and etc'
p20172
aS' One thing which can be improved onto the helicopter is the rotors'
p20173
aS' It could be extended a little longer as the size of the helicopter is too big'
p20174
aS' It makes the rotors rather weak as it is not able to support the weight'
p20175
aS' I am confused why there is an extreme team personnel there'
p20176
aS' I thought he was supposed to be recovered from the Res-Q team? Although there is so many questions in my head such as why include the black tri-cycle bike, Extreme Team, and etc but this is still one very good set to play with'
p20177
aS' Too bad, I had never seen this before'
p20178
aS' Somehow, through your review, I like it very much'
p20179
aS' The only big scale helicopter which I owned is the 7738 Coast Guard Helicopter and Lift Raft'
p20180
aS' Neverthless, I gave this a "4"'
p20181
aS' Thanks Brickster'
p20182
aS'The helicopter looks nice and the RESQ minifigs were nice'
p20183
aS' The diver minifig had once been a personal favorite of mine'
p20184
aS"Thanks for the review brickster, I do own this set in it's original form, The only drawback that I have noted previously is the lack of rotor's and the cobraesq of the copter body I wish it had a larger fuselage but I still have it and I still like it despite my criticism"
p20185
aS'Which I am sure is in my eyes only'
p20186
aS' Thanks again Brickster'
p20187
aS' I wish I had bought some of the other Res Q sets but of course I only bought three'
p20188
aS'A neat set with lots of accessories, but I never liked any of the LEGO helicopters with long streamlined canopies, as they are obviously more influenced by military helicopters and space ships, than by real civilian transport helicopters'
p20189
aS" I'd give it a 3 at best"
p20190
aS' Very good and thourough pictorial review though!'
p20191
aS"I've always wanted this set and the hovercraft"
p20192
aS' too bad I never did'
p20193
aS' Great set'
p20194
aS'I stopped collecting LEGO sets in the early 90s because of this kind of sets'
p20195
aS" I've always been a classic town fan and I really didn't liked the futuristic design of TLC's newer sets"
p20196
aS"I think the set is too unrealistic, I like the new ResQ sets better (and I'm somewhat a Lifeboat freak so I'm always following such a sets with interest)"
p20197
aS' I would like to see some rigit inflatable boats some day ;) but about the chopper, I like the accessoiries'
p20198
aS"What exactly makes you feel this set isn't realistic? It has got nothing what wouldn't be on a real helicopter, imo"
p20199
aS' and for the futuristic design, yes, it looks modern, but it works'
p20200
aS" And actually, most of today's real helicopters also don't look like in the 70's anymore"
p20201
aS"metalandi, on Aug 24 2008, 04:17 PM, said: What exactly makes you feel this set isn't realistic? Since the question was asked"
p20202
aS' 1) tiny rotors 2) dual cockpits (only seen on a few military copters) 3) stretcher extends beyone edges of fuselage when inside the vehicle 4) Extra long canopy (really only seen on military helicopters), and "military" design'
p20203
aS' 5) Black colorscheme for rescue vehicle'
p20204
aS' The the stretcher, minifig designs and rescue logo are the only things about this copter that really suggest that it is a civilian rescue aircraft'
p20205
aS" It's a toy set with alot of play value, but I agree with Karto that these kind of desgins really turned me off to alot of the TOWN and CITY sets of the 90's"
p20206
aS' On the positive side, the new CITY sets, with thier realistic non-futuristic designs have really tempted me to buy more vehicles'
p20207
aS"It took quite some time, but now i'm finally continuing with city reviews"
p20208
aS' This one beeing about a really good set of the RES-Q theme, and also one of my favourites of this theme'
p20209
aS' It brings a lot of playability and an incredible amount of useful pieces, even with only 145 bricks in complete'
p20210
aS' Set Nr'
p20211
aS": 6451 Name: River Response Number of minifigs: 3 Number of pieces: 145 Release Year: 1998 Price: ~20 USD (Back then, when it was new) Unfortunately i haven't got the box of this set anymore, but the instructions are still there in good condition: We get 3 RES-Q minifigs in this set, from which i really love the detailed torso's: A shot of the complete set with both the boat and the little car off board: The before mentioned car is really, really little, but it still got enough space to transport 2 minifigs: A closeup of the rubber dinghy: The speed boat as stand-alone: As already said before, this set brings a big count of equipment and accesoires with it, which is really good for a set this size: In the middle section of the boat there is enough space for a minifig to sit in and put on his diving equipment: And last but not least, a shot from the whole set wirh everything attached, at the front section you can see a wench which also adds a lot to the set: When i got this set back in the day, i was really happy about it and for sure spent a lot of tie playing with it, because of it's great features as the wench in the front of the boat, or the car the boat can transport"

p20267
aS'Very nicely done - this cart is a striking resemblance to the crossbow cart we got in 2007'
p20268
aS'Nice review I agree with Thok its quite similar to the more recent crossbow attack, though this one has the added benefit of two shields'
p20269
aS' This set would I fleet be more useful to army builders than most of the modern castle sets, even though many people dont like frightknights'
p20270
aS'Quote even though many people dont like frightknights'
p20271
aS" I don't really like Fright Knights either I just happened to have this set"

p20275
aS" I've added it to the index"
p20276
aS" I'm not a fan of this theme"
p20277
aS' But I have to say that this is a neat little set, that does hold some good things'
p20278
aS' Figs and weapons are always welcome and one can never have to many wheels'
p20279
aS' So I rate this "Average'
p20280
aS'This is a pretty nice set'
p20281
aS' I really like the torso and its "genericness" so it can be used for other factions'
p20282
aS" And at least this set has 2 shields (althought I prefer the triangular ones) instead of just 1 shield you get from crossbow attack (from the wrong fraction, I'd have liked a crown knights shield 100x better)"
p20283
aS' Some improvements for this set would be a normal bow and a sword instead of 2 of the 3 crossbows, smaller wheels and triangular shields'
p20284
aS" 4/5 from me (actually 3,5 but I'll round it up)"
p20285
aS'I gave it Above Average'
p20286
aS' It was a nice set and included some nice pieces, but it is only an impulse set after all'

p20289
aS' 1) the set makes a great little adventure airstrip for Adventurers and more recent, the Indiana Jones theme (see also German Headquarters and Port Adventure)'
p20290
aS" I've also used the set as an addition to my Wild West town"
p20291
aS' The tan baseplate and windmill works great, just subtract the plane, modern equipment, and figs'

p20295
aS' I love the swamp boat: The building is my favorite part of the set'

aS' It is simple, has a little detail, two great roof pieces, and a single green window (great piece!): Check out the great windmill piece'

aS' I used it for the Barnhouse of Barnabas Higgens and Spring Valley Ranch On the side of the building is a great radio and a clear glass: Unfortunately, no furniture can be found within the building: And now the airplane: Front view; I love the twin propellors: Side view: And the rear section: The back has a small cargo hold for some boxes/freight or some gear needed in the Outback: The set includes three figs, two with cool shades: And some great equipment'
p20299
aS' I love the boom box: A shot of the whole set: And another: Summary: As I mentioned above, this set is very versatile and can suplement a few different themes'
p20300
aS" It's my personal favorite of the Outback collection and I'm really glad I was able to find the set in the late 90s (I almost didn't buy)"
p20301
aS' Sets like this are timeless and so much fun to build and display'

p20304
aS'Great Review! This set has cool features'
p20305
aS' I just wish that Lego would release this as a Lego Legend and release it to Australia too, since this is a set about Australia'
p20306
aS" I would've bought two if this were a Lego Legend"
p20307
aS' That is how good it is'
p20308
aS' I like the building with latticed window and windmill'
p20309
aS' I also like the cargo airplane, windsock, and radios'
p20310
aS" Plus it looks like it's got great minifigs"
p20311
aS'This is really an ideal small set'
p20312
aS' In spite of its size, it has nearly everything:  Three minifigs  A vehicle  A building  Numerous minifig accessories  Numerous rare and useful parts  Nice model design (especially for the time period) Too bad Outback came out during my dark years'
p20313
aS'This is probably my all-time favorite LEGO set'
p20314
aS' It was originally given to me for my birthday by a close friend of mine back in the release year of 1997'
p20315
aS' The cargo plane was, by far, my favorite vehicle ever'
p20316
aS" Unfortunately, someone stole the plane from me when our families went on vacation and the rest of the set was given to my cousin's oldest son when I was no longer interested in my LEGO collection"
p20317
aS" Now that I'm back into LEGO, I use that building's construction for various projects, especially as a Dr"
p20318
aS' Inferno look-out shack using parts from extra Mission 3: Swamp Raid'
p20319
aS' The shack compliments the original set greatly'

aS'This was a cool set I thoght of it as i was building The post plane'
p20322
aS'The Building is great and detailed, with a few mods it could be added to my Castle town'
p20323
aS" I don't really like the plane though, seems kind of abstract, not really good in my opinion, but I bet it would be easy to mod to look better"
p20324
aS'One of the best in my humble opinion'
p20325
aS' As far as I know it was never released in the UK so the only reason I managed to get my hands on it was on a family holiday to the US, I think theyd only recently opened the Lego store in Disney'
p20326
aS' Arguable the best feature is that it seems to fit into a wide selection of themes, is it a airstrip in the middle of nowhere, is it next to a only mining town thats not deserted the possibilities are rather open and thats truly great'
p20327

aS' Interesting thought'
p20329
aS" I have the post plane but I haven't opened it yet"
p20330
aS" I suppose it's the yellow"
p20331
aS' The plane in this set is much different than most of the other Classic Town airplanes in that it has the double tail section'
p20332
aS" Here's a shot of the new 7732 Air Mail set - definately a nice set:"
p20333

p20336
aS'com Introcomment: I remember getting this set solely because I collect Star Wars'
p20337
aS' As I rebuild it and took pics of it, I found that I actually like this set for different reasons'
p20338
aS" Dooku's speeder is pretty cool and the lightsabre rocks"
p20339
aS' The Dooku minifig is also great'
p20340
aS" What's not so great is the flythingy and getting another Yoda"
p20341
aS' Though that\'s kinda hard not to get in a set focused on their duel "You can\'t see the wires, because they digitally removed them'
p20342
aS'" "Be careful or I\'ll digidally remove your head" - Steven Seagal [I hope I quoted that one right ] So to get the review on the move, I\'ll impress you all with a box picture: Neat, huh? One of the smaller boxes, but still kinda big when consider that you only get 74 pieces and 2 minifigs'
p20343
aS" The instruction isn't that big As I said, the Dooku minifigs is awesome I love the print on his torso that combines the brown cape with the torso and also the head is neatly designed"
p20344
aS' Not a fleshie, though'
p20345
aS' This was before the flesh-license-facelift A sideview of the light blue speeder'
p20346
aS' Mmmm that crome light sabre hilt is nice The design of the speeder is also ok, and without the usual off-colour-scheme bricks'
p20347
aS" No tan or yellow sticking out there Yeah, I'd panic too if this came right at me"
p20348
aS"who wouldn't when noone's driving? And a rear shot"
p20349
aS' I think the design is a little off'
p20350
aS' The shields makes it all a little too open in my opinion'
p20351
aS' The printed bricks are a kick and thus evens the score here'
p20352
aS' This hideous design is meant to flip Yoda around the air'
p20353
aS' Put him in this funfair from Hell thing and give him a twister he and Dooku will never forget'
p20354
aS" My guess is that it's there to add some playability, but it's just odd and quite useless"
p20355
aS' Much like the playability soccer thingies in the Ultimate Light Sabre Duel The Verdict: Ups and downs'
p20356
aS' This set offers both'
p20357
aS' I rate it as "Average" since the size and price of the set make it acceptable to have odd things'
p20358
aS" Confused? Good so am I Making a small set isn't that easy and remeber this set is from 2002 and a lot has happended since then, designwise that is"
p20359
aS' What do you think?'
p20360
aS'Whats wrong with another yoda and some nice light blue bricks? I probably would destroy this set, and keep the minifigs intack tough, chrome lightsabers on!'
p20361
aS'Thanks for the review KimT! Oldies reviews(old sets ) Are always appreciated'
p20362
aS" I feel this set isn't that great"
p20363
aS' 1- Yoda: He is by far the best part of the set'
p20364
aS" Although, is his weapon blue? 2-Lord Tyrannus: Pretty nice! I feel the middle part of his torso is a bit bland, but that isn't a problem"
p20365
aS' I wish they would make a fleshie one too'
p20366
aS' 3- Speeder bike: I always hated this design'
p20367
aS' The back looks terrible to me'
p20368
aS' Way too bulky in my opinion'
p20369
aS" It jusn't give me the image that it's the same as the movie"
p20370
aS' The lightsaber is amazing! Why is it only in this set? 4-Yoda-Lifter: What? That is terrible'
p20371
aS' But at least it has some nicely colored parts'
p20372
aS' A fine set, but not the best IMO'
p20373
aS'You think it\'s not a great thing that we get a Yoda fig in an affordable set like this?!? That was the main reason why I got this set! And what do you mean by "another"? Wasn\'t this the only one that was ever released except for the one in the Dagobah/X-Wing set? Sure, he is not the best fig with the unmovable legs and all, but still: It\'s Yoda! Besides, he doesn\'t move his legs a lot in "real" life either'
p20374
aS' Nice review, though, and thanks for telling me what that liftarm-thingy was meant to be for'
p20375
aS' I never got that and thought it was supposed to lift up the speeder for some reason'
p20376
aS' I got two of this set, and the printing on those blue parts were off in the second one I got'
p20377
aS' Edited by Oky Wan Kenobi, 18 August 2008 - 08:45 PM'
p20378
aS'No, Yoda was released in no less than 3(4) sets'
p20379
aS' Ok, so I remembered wrong'
p20380
aS' I just have plenty Yodas and one is more than enough For the set list click here Thanks for pointing that out'
p20381
aS'Nice review I realy like this set, two nice minifigs in an affordable set and i do like the speeder but that lift thing is strange, but now at least i know what it is, thanks for letting me know!'
p20382
aS'Thanks for the nice review KimT '
p20383
aS' I like this set especially by the fact that it is the only set containing the Dooku minifig and the curved lightsaber , I also think that the minifig is cool but I also own the Dagobah x-wing and the wookiee catamaran sets so I have enought minifigs (A clone wars version would be very cool ) and the extra-thingy is well, just OK'
p20384
aS' The bad part is that I don?t buy the set when it is out and now is go for $40 on ebay and bricklink '

p20387
aS'runs to check Brickset'
p20388
aS" yep, there's a Yoda in that set, as well"
p20389
aS' But the Jedi Duel is the only reasonably priced set with the green Force-guru'
p20390
aS" Nevermind, looks like a couple of other members already covered Yoda's availability in other sets"
p20391
aS' Back on topic: Great review, and a real blast from the past'
p20392
aS" I never did get this set, just didn't care for the speederbike or the weird piece of equipment"
p20393
aS' Thanks for explaining that it\'s supposed to be used to "force-jump & spin" Yoda all over the place'
p20394
aS" I never knew that's what it was for"
p20395
aS" Anyway, wish I had known Yoda and Dooku were going to be impossible to get later; I may've picked this set up just for the minifigs"
p20396
aS' Edited by bamaker, 18 August 2008 - 10:39 PM'
p20397
aS'I think this is a pretty lame set'
p20398
aS' It came with Dooku, who I think only came in this set, plus a unique Lightsaber'
p20399
aS' Still, they could have made it much bigger, added Anikan and Obi-Wan, and added structures and made it more like the scene from the movie'
p20400
aS" Also, the speeder doesn't seem very accurate"
p20401
aS'I missed out on this set but it looks pretty good IMO'
p20402
aS' Thanks for clearing up what that thing was I thought it was something they flung at eachother in the movie I like the lightsaber also but why did they stop making chrome ones'
p20403
aS'I wonder how expensive this set would be on Ebay'
p20404
aS' (Shop Victoriously)'
p20405
aS'I missed this set'
p20406
aS'But i reallly like the yoda and count dooku'
p20407
aS"I especially like count dooku's lightsaber"
p20408
aS"One thing though,is it me oris yoda's lightsaber blue in the picture? Edited by pr0visorak, 20 August 2008 - 12:21 PM"
p20409
aS'I was very lucky to get this set and I love it, I dont have it built cause i bought it for parts but it was fun while it lasted'
p20410
aS'I got this set a long time ago'
p20411
aS' The review pretty much says all there is to say about it'
p20412
aS' (Never knew what the red/brown thing was anyway, I used it as a canon'
p20413
aS") Isn't this also the only set up until now that had Count Dooku in it?"
p20414
aS'Great review, KimT! At that time, it was still in my dark age and I hated myself not to get this set earlier'
p20415
aS' This is quite inexpensive and you are able to get two greatest characters especially Count Dooku'
p20416
aS" The minifigs are excellent, especially the unique design of Count Dooku's lightsaber"
p20417
aS' I have no problem with the speedbike, as it looks quite alright to me'
p20418
aS" As for the elevation of Yoda's jump adds some playabilty, but that does not work well for me"
p20419
aS' Nevertheless, the main attractive factor is Count Dooku and I have to rate it a "5"'
p20420
aS' I never own a Yoda, except for the magnet version'
p20421
aS'Cheers for the review KimT! Of the initial Episode II Lego releases this set was the least inspiring, but the minifigs were must-haves'
p20422
aS" You can't go wrong with Count Dooku and Yoda! I like the design of Dooku's speeder in the movie but Lego missed the mark a bit with it here and gave him a dodgy flying boat instead! The speeder cradle/Yoda jumping mechanism was just a waste of parts unfortunately"
p20423
aS" I'd like to see Dooku's speeder re-imagined by Lego"
p20424
aS" They've come a long way in the way they design a lot of the new Star Wars sets"

p20531
aS": 6584 Name: Extreme Team Challenge Number of minifigs: 4 Number of pieces: 354 Release Year: 1998 Let's start off with a few quick shots of the box & instructions: Inside of the box: We got some ideas for alternative models on the backside (the same ones are also on the backside of the instructions): Instructions: Here's an overall view of this huge set: We get 4 minifigs, each with different heads and color patterns, which i really like: "
p20532
aS'and also a good amount of equipment for them: Let\'s move on with the cool vehicles, there are 3 (!) completely different ones in this set, first is the neat little trike: Next, the not less neat "4-wheeled off-road-thing" (don\'t know what\'s it called really ): And finally the huge Monster truck, i love the chrome sidepipes and the wench with the hook in the back, which adds a lot of playability: Oh, i almost forgot our brave adventurers also have got a raft to ride the wild mountain waters: Now let\'s focus on the many details of the mountain base'
p20533
aS" We got a bridge over troubled waters, but be aware, it's very unstable! Love the wood patterns on the yellow 1x6 tiles: On a corner a camera is mounted to document the wild life: For the evenings we also got a little campfire: Down by the river sits a grey falcon and watches the guys on their challenges: What's that? Seems not very safe, to be honest"
p20534
aS'be aware when you pass by these rocks'

aS"cause it will collapse! Let's move up again where the tent is placed, inside is plenty of space to take a rest for the figs and to store their equipment: But i think they should have built the tent on another place cause the ground isn't very good there: When you pull the mechanism, a trap door opens: Will the guys all come back home safe and not injured? You decide! All in all this is a really great set, ome may say it is a bit juniorized because of the baseplate, but it really isn't"
p20536
aS" It's got a LOT of playability and some rare parts, the biggest beeing the baseplate which is only available in this set"
p20537

aS'Thank you for that very interesting review, metalandi'
p20554
aS' A cool set with a lot of features and some nifty vehicles, very playable and well designed indeed'
p20555
aS' Perhaps a bit too colorful for my likings, but pretty impressive in its conception for sure'
p20556
aS' I wish we could see some more landscaping coming along with todays vehicle sets as well'
p20557
aS'Set data 4920: The Rapid Rider Year: 1999 Subtheme: Rock Raiders Pieces: 37 (+1 extra - TrNeonGreen Plate 1 x 1 Round) Price: Euro 3,50, used, not including S/H, on eBay Building time: less than 10 minutes'
p20558
aS' More info: Bricklink - Peeron'
p20559
aS" I could have owned the 4910 Hover scout (see Metalandi's review here), but while I was buying some used sets, I forgot to buy that one too! So, here's my only RR set, the second smallest one (if we don't count Japanese promos; sweets are surely sweeter if they come with a Lego set!) Pieces: Face and torso closeup; I like the torso, the face is good except for the bandanna"
p20560
aS' Building is based on two big pieces: Landing Skids and Plate 6 x 6 x 2/3 Cross with Dome'
p20561
aS" Let's go! Building is over: Review: Pros: Small set (= cheap), 1 fig, two accessories, some interesting pieces like the rock and the Crystal"
p20562
aS' No stickers but 3 printed pieces! Good color choice'
p20563
aS' Cons: Tipper Bucket is fixed, no hinge'
p20564
aS' No levers or steering wheel, it probably moves by using the buttons on the 2x2 tile'
p20565
aS' It deserves a 4/5'
p20566
aS'This was the first Rock raiders set I got'
p20567
aS' I really like it, and I think I got all of them except the huge cargo airlift thing'

p20569
aS' sadly'
p20570
aS' Nice Review'
p20571
aS'When I first saw this review title, I thought it said "Rapid River Review" thinking it was an Indian set (6766)'
p20572
aS' Nice review though'
p20573
aS' I never got into Rock Raiders'
p20574
aS' I would have loved the large drill bit piece for set #s 4970 and 4940'
p20575
aS' This set looks like a little boulder hawler, and a nice set to introduce someone unfamilar with the theme'
p20576
aS' I esp'
p20577
aS' like the fig and the little 2x2 drill bit tile'
p20578
aS' The overall set looks like it has some very useful mining-type pieces'
p20579
aS' Nice review and thanks for sharing'
p20580
aS'I have never seen this set before but the minifig head would be perfect for a Solid Snake from MGS 2!'
p20581
aS'Rock Raiders was the shit back in the day'
p20582
aS' Awesome theme! I had this set as well as the Tunnel Transporter, which was amazing'
p20583
aS'Thanks for the review! Rock Raiders was one of the last new themes i knew as a kid before my dark ages came'
p20584
aS' Unfortunately i never managed to get any sets from it, beside a few months ago the 4910 The Hover Scout, which i review a while ago'
p20585
aS' Wish i can get some of the bigger sets in the future'
p20586
aS'I always thought that this set was under-rated'
p20587
aS' It contains a really interesting collection of parts, a decent fig, and introduces an odd theme in only one set'
p20588
aS" Very well designed for one of the 'not greats'"
p20589
aS' God Bless, Nathan'

p20592
aS' This outlet is one of the most favourite eatery for any LEGO citizens living in their town'
p20593
aS' When they are driving on the road, they are sure to look out "PIZZERIA" signage'
p20594
aS' They offer the best pizza in town'
p20595
aS' No one in town can resist the delicious aroma of Pizza, coming out from the red chimney'
p20596
aS' Let us find out why is this shop so popular among so many LEGO citizens and was one of the famous sets that is re-released under the "LEGEND" theme'
p20597
aS' Pizza To Go is my favourite set of all time'
p20598
aS' I believed there is no other pizza outlet lying around in any LEGO city apart Pizzeria'
p20599
aS' It seemed there are the sole outlet that is selling pizza for many years'
p20600
aS' This set was re-released in 2002 and it is part of the LEGEND theme'
p20601
aS' This is one of the few sets that are highly demanded to be brought back by many fans of LEGO around the world'
p20602
aS' I owned the 6350'
p20603
aS' Any members whom had owned both sets before? Is there any difference between these two? Because when I searched through Peeron, it shown 144 pieces instead of 194 pieces for the 1994 set'
p20604
aS' Name: Pizza To Go Theme: LEGO System / Town Year: 1994 (Re-release: 2002) Pieces: 194 Minifigs: 3 An image of a 6350, Pizza To Go Let the delivery begins! Pizza To Go is the regular pizza outlet that sells nothing but pizza'
p20605
aS' They deliever pizza to every household in town, with their trusty delivery van'
p20606
aS' Walk-in are welcomed too'
p20607
aS' There is a stand for customers to dine in their pizza quickly before making their way to their next destination'
p20608
aS' In my opnon, no town can ever survive without the Pizza Tradition! Devoted "PIZZERIA" staff Every outlet comes with 3 dedicated staff, making sure that operations will run smoothly'
p20609
aS' On the left, we will have the Pizza Boy, whom is wearing the regular blue dungarees and its white cap'
p20610
aS' I wonder who is that boy? On the middle, we will have the Pizza Girl'
p20611
aS' She looks like any typical sweet girl in town that the boys will look at'
p20612
aS' She is wearing a suntop strapless on her'
p20613
aS' She reminded me of one person though, I think her name is called Alice'
p20614
aS' Taking a careful look, I wonder if ImperialShadows is the Pizza Boy back then, without that black patch on its left eye? On another note, this mini-figure was my favourite'
p20615
aS' Female mini-figures are very uncommon back then'
p20616
aS' I am glad I have this figure, adding to my town population'
p20617
aS' On the right, we will have the hardworking chef, preparing the pizzas in the oven'
p20618
aS' He wears the regular white chef outfit, but he wear a grey pants instead of the usual full-white outfit in most resturants such as Breezeway Cafe (6376)'
p20619
aS" Let's take a closer look at the Pizza Boy's van! This van is very very small looking and very fuel efficient"
p20620
aS' It is able to cut lanes very fast due to its small size'
p20621
aS' The pizza van is made up of 4-studs wide design'
p20622
aS' No doors by the side'
p20623
aS' However, in this vehicle, I think the doors is not a must to be included in this design'
p20624
aS' Our Pizza Boy will need to leave vehicle pretty fast, and ensuring that the pizza delivery is on time'
p20625
aS' Common mechanism This van has the regular rooftop that can be lifted up to place the Pizza Boy into the driver seat'
p20626
aS' There is a sun roof on its top, which enable him to let him have some sunlight from above! The logo on the side of it, is actually a transparent sticker, which have the PIZZERIA itallian logo and a tasty looking pizza on both sides of its van'
p20627
aS' I like that sticker very much'
p20628
aS' Mine looks quite worn out over time'
p20629
aS' If its a printed piece, It will be a terrific bonus'
p20630
aS' Nevertheless, I can still accept the sticker'
p20631
aS' Our pizza van can deliever up to 2 pizza at a go! At every trip, 2 piping hot pizza will be stored at the back of the van'
p20632
aS' The pizza is fitted in perfectly in each compartment'
p20633
aS' Furthermore, the white window shutter, is terrific in this design'
p20634
aS" You don't see this kind of design anymore"
p20635
aS' I think, I have not seen much delivery vans on the street anymore too'
p20636
aS' Base of the van From the base, you can see that it is using of the regular red car base that is common in most 4-studs vehicle design'
p20637
aS' In fact, this car base served as a foundation for its vehicle design'
p20638
aS' Back of PIZZERIA Alice and the Chef will be showing you around at the back of the kitchen'
p20639
aS' There is an oven on the left, a water tap and a holder for the oar stick'
p20640
aS' Looks pretty empty right? Look below for a surprise! My favourite feature! This oven can be used to heat up 2 pizzas at a go'
p20641
aS' Now, I understand why, this set is named "Pizza To Go"'
p20642
aS' I have been using their slogan unknowingly'
p20643
aS' This feature is superb nice'
p20644
aS' Now, we know that the pizza is prepared from the outlet instead of using delivery van to collect it from a factory'
p20645
aS' Alice, what are you waiting for? Help the Chef quickly! PIZZERIA! The signage sure looks big from far and catches their attention easily too with its pleasnt looking design'
p20646
aS' As you have already noticed, this is made up of sticker'
p20647
aS" I don't mind, for this set, it contains sticker"
p20648
aS' Sometimes, I do hope they can give us spare sticker for us to change, after a long period of time'
p20649
aS' Distinct red chimney This is the front of the oven, and that is where the smoke comes out'
p20650
aS' Using only bricks to construct this, is simply wonderful'
p20651
aS' I like the use of their white bricks to construct the wall layout, and a combination of red parts, especially on the top'
p20652
aS' I like the look of this very much'
p20653
aS' Another picture on its side Printed parts In this set, you will get a total of 5 pizzas! And, I believed no other sets offer so many pizza'
p20654
aS' You can placed up to 4 pizzas in the van and oven'
p20655
aS' Alice will be carrying the last pizza around'
p20656
aS' The green and red round dish is a printed part'
p20657
aS' Most Exclusive part in 6350/10036 The most unique and important printed parts that is only exclusive in this set'
p20658
aS" It's at the front of the Pizza van"
p20659
aS' It is none other, but the Pizzeria logo, standing at the front of the delivery van'

aS' Comments and Critics are strongly welcomed'
p20672
aS' Pictures can be found in My Brickshelf(When moderated)'
p20673
aS'Easily one of the best town sets ever (and pretty expensive for its size too, is/was it that rare?)'
p20674
aS' I hope I still have all the pieces from mine, unfortunately, my stickers are in pretty bad shape (took them off because I needed the bricks, stupid stickers covering multiple parts , only downside to this set)'
p20675
aS' The design is simple, yet so detailed, and the pizza van looks great'
p20676
aS' 5/5'
p20677
aS"I do like the set, although I don't own it"
p20678
aS' I do remember lusting after it when I was a kid, though (mainly because of the female minifig and the colors)'
p20679
aS" It's a bit simplistic, but comes with a few great parts"
p20680
aS' You also did a great job on describing the set, and the pictures give the full impression of the appearance'
p20681
aS' For the review, I just have to point out a few things, to give you constructive criticism: first of all, it\'s chef, not "chief" (entirely different professions), and secondly, the scale you give in the poll isn\'t very even'
p20682
aS' "Above average" jumps to "outstanding", which is a too big of a gap in my opinion'
p20683
aS' You should\'ve used "Good" or "Great" in between them'
p20684
aS' But these are only minor faults, this is a good review anyway!'
p20685
aS'I rate it a full 5 too'
p20686
aS' And I wish Lego would make a set like this in 2010'
p20687
aS" A town needs pizza! Edit: don't always trust Peeron"

aS' I had amended the word "chief" to "chef"'
p20698
aS' You might want to check it'
p20699
aS' I did not notice that I was using the wrong word'
p20700
aS' As for the poll definitions which have been used, for 1 to 5'
p20701
aS' We used "Poor" to represent value "1" while "Outstanding" to represent value "5"'
p20702
aS' We need to use clear definitions to illustrate and demostrate non-bias towards the review for the readers to cast their vote depending on their individual liking'
p20703
aS' Therefore, we used a common word which is known as "Average"'
p20704
aS" In surveys, for measuring its sample size's liking, we have to use words which is neutral such as Strongly agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, Strongly disagree"
p20705
aS" That's why, we used this rating approach to represent the terms"

p20714
aS'got this one as well, not much surprises in such a small set, but the fast-food pizza idea is pretty cool'
p20715
aS" as far as i know only the small mcdonalds promo and this set are related to food/restaurant thing (until the cafe corner that is) But since i have a classic lego city i can't miss this set"
p20716
aS'This set looks really cool, especially for one this inexpensive'
p20717
aS' The van is neat, and the hidden storage compartment i back is the icing on the cake'

aS'One of my greatest lacks in my town'
p20727

p20755

aS"INDEXED Allright, hi everybody again! Today, i'm gonna review the biggest set of the RES-Q Subtheme, 6479 Emergency Response Center"
p20839
aS" With this one i think, the reviews of all the RES-Q sets are complete now, and while i'm in a reviewing mode right now i thought i'd bring that up"
p20840
aS' This set hast got many nice aspects and also some very rare pieces, and comes with a wonderful amount of vehicles, including a speedboat, a tow truck, a helicopter, and a trike which can pull a little boat'
p20841
aS" So sit down, get your popcorn and beer, we're off to stormy weather at the coast! Sub-Theme: RES-Q Set Nr"
p20842
aS": 6479 Name: Emergency Response Center Number of minifigs: 5 Number of pieces: 420 Release Year: 1998 Unfortunately i don't have many of the boxes of my res-q sets anymore, so i'll start right off with the instructions this time: On the backside there is no alternate model as usual this time, but only a different shot of the whole set: Next, a general overview, sorry about the slightly bad picture quality on some pics this time: Originally this set has 5 minfigs (which all are really nice!), but the guy who drives the tow truck has been lost in the flood Here's a picture of the missing fig: Let's move on to the vehicles, we have something for the water, the ground and the air in this set, first the great tow truck: I love the mechanism with the hooks in the back: Next on, da Speedboat! At the rear, it's got a stretcher and a wench, which adds a lot of playability: If there's a a little accident near the coast, the trike comes to appearance: For more complicated stuff, we have a little helicopter (i broke the rotating piece at the top yesterday, ouch! : ) No space for a victim you say? Well, not really, but the helicopter also got a wench with a hook in the back: Now it comes to the station itself, at the docks a neat life belt sign is mounted (remember, at this time there weren't real ones as today): A little more right an equipment holder is placed, with various tools on the front"
p20843
aS"and fire fighter equip at the back: At the very front a little lighttower secures the shelter: I haven't quite found out what this thing is supposed to be, maybe somebody knows Another equipment holder, this time with all the stuff you need for diving: More equipment"
p20844
aS'and even MORE! We come to the hear piece of the station, the control room with lots of buttons and scrrens: Last but not least, a quick shot of all the accesoires and tools that you get, which really is an A-MA-ZING amount! This set might have a few junioriced pieces, as the big window in the front or the "briedge" on the roof, but that doesn\'t matter, because there is nearly one other set in which you get so much rare pieces and such an overwhelming amount of accesoires, so i can recommend that for everybody who is a pieces-fanatic'
p20845
aS' Not to forget the playability, the great figs and the, in my opinion very good color scheme'
p20846

p20855
aS"I have this set and it's pretty nice"
p20856
aS' I love the Res-Q theme in general'
p20857
aS" I think that tow truck is easily the highlight of this set and is probably the best such vehicle I've seen in any City set"
p20858
aS' The other vehicles are also great'
p20859
aS" The base itself is lacking though, as it basically consists of one room that doesn't even have side walls"
p20860
aS' It does include a cool 3x6 computer sticker and a vast array of minifig tools and equipment though'
p20861
aS' I have some plans to modify the building and make it larger but have never gotten around to doing it'
p20862
aS'I just built this set in MLCad as a requestfor a fellow Eurobricks member'
p20863
aS' Somehow I missed out on this set completely when it came out'
p20864

aS'Hi everyone, this is my first review on LEGO sets here'
p20871
aS' Hope you guys like it'
p20872
aS' And I would like to apologise for the bad quality pictures'
p20873
aS" Hope you guys don't mind"
p20874
aS' First I will start with the box art'
p20875
aS' Box art: I guess this is the first time that LEGO Star Wars sets use white and blue colour for their box'
p20876
aS' I like the new colour scheme, a nice blend though'
p20877
aS" Here's the front: The back: Not to waste space on the box LEGO do some advertisement to attract us to buy more sets"
p20878
aS' :grin:the more The side: At the top side there is this minifigs scale picture'
p20879
aS' It is great as we get to know the real size of a minifigs'
p20880
aS' Contents: The contents consist of a sticker sheet, instruction book, and 8 packet of bricks'
p20881
aS' The packer are not numbered'
p20882
aS' But it is ok as there is not much pieces'
p20883
aS' Instruction book and random page: As usual the instruction book have brick checklist, other sets pictures, and tutorial on how you should assemble your set (I mean the very first page)'
p20884
aS' Sticker sheet: There is not much sticker sheet and is a great news that the Republic logo on the round plate is printed unlike Republic Gunship'
p20885
aS" Anyway, I didn't apply the stickers"
p20886
aS' The Commander Gear: This is a new thing to minifigs as well'
p20887
aS' Well is like Batman accessories, they pack it in one small packet'
p20888
aS' However, you only get one commander gear pack in this set'
p20889
aS" Anyway, i didn't use them"
p20890
aS' The minifigs: Well, we get the the new minifigs'
p20891
aS' The ugly face clone, new printed torso and new mold of helmet'
p20892
aS' However i not really like the new head stud, i prefer a black one or at least the one like Jango Fett, black colour with face'
p20893
aS' The helmet: Everything is printed, no holes at the visor there, but there are hole on the both side'
p20894
aS' This new helmet mold also made the headgear turn 360 degree freely'
p20895
aS' Without helmet: With helmet: You can see the flesh tone at the hole beside'
p20896
aS' The blasters: @ short blasters were given instead of long one'
p20897
aS' Is great, at least they give us two blasters instead of one'
p20898
aS' The tank: Here is the pics of the tank'
p20899
aS' It was not badly design nor nicely design'
p20900
aS" But it looks great if you didn't saw the beneath or under the tank"
p20901
aS" View from front: View from side: View from back: What's beneath? Under it was 4 wheels, to make it move fluently"
p20902
aS' It is made by the thread supporter like the one we fet from TIE Crawler or Bat-Tank The functions: Well firstly, you can open up the hood (I guess) to see the engine'
p20903
aS' Secondly the side cannon that can move upwards'
p20904
aS' The thing is quite tight (see random instruction page) and there is barrier to block the cannon from going downwards'
p20905
aS' The cockpit: Well the cockpit is small and the space is limited'
p20906
aS' The monitor stuff is printed brick and is another great news'
p20907
aS' You have to remove the piece (pic below) to reveal the cockpit and put your clone to pilot it'
p20908
aS' Pop-up gunner mechanism: Well the backdoor have a thing to attack to the seat of the gunner'
p20909
aS' The top hatch is very loose'
p20910
aS' So it there is a clone as a gunner and you open the back door, the clone will pop-up and automatically open the hatch on top'
p20911
aS' This is how the top looks like without a clone'
p20912
aS' There is this movable cannon (upwards, left and right) and a little keyboard thing with it'
p20913
aS' But the cannon fall off quite easily'
p20914
aS' The flick launching missile mechanism: The mechanism is on both side and you need to turn the thing inwards to reveal the flick fire mechanism'
p20915
aS' Below are the pic of how it is turned'
p20916
aS' You can keep you blaster at the front of the side'
p20917
aS' There are place for you to store them'
p20918
aS' It close nicely'
p20919
aS' Completion: This is how it looks like'
p20920
aS' Extra parts: There quite a number of them'
p20921
aS' Overall: This set is not bad'
p20922
aS' The price is quite expensive but you will like it'
p20923
aS' The pop-up mechanism is something new (to me) but this set have more function and 2 Clone Trooper with a pack of Commander gear'
p20924
aS' Pros: -2x Clone Troopers -high playability -nice design Cons: -a little expensive -sticker sheet -cannon on top falls off quite easy Edited by KimT, 27 August 2008 - 12:16 PM'

p20947
aS' I have to admit that I love this Fighter Tank very much'
p20948
aS' The downside of it which is overpriced, and two Clone troopers do not really justify the purchase'
p20949

p20957
aS' I recall Jake saying something about it being new LEGO policy to supply the minifig heads and torsos separately'
p20958
aS" What with the expenses-trimming and all, it's apparently one of the many little quirky things they've discovered in the manufacturing and packaging process that people have done for years without thinking (in this case, putting the heads on the torsos) but that turns out to be a surprisingly significant expense (timewise, I suppose)"

p20967
aS" Its a darn shame that it can't be extended"
p20968
aS" However, I see no reason why LEGO couldn't produce a special middle hull piece that is compatible"
p20969
aS" Although the way they've made the hull is a bit stupid"
p20970
aS' The old system was a lot more flexible'
p20971
aS" Better still why can't LEGO design a hull that can be extended in length and width"
p20972
aS' Then they could be as made as long or wide as desired and that would be great!'

p21007
aS" Now I don't HATE the hull, my problem is that is doesn't connect with bricks like the old Pirate ships"
p21008
aS" There are pros and cons to this, on the plus side its more secure, and your whole ship doesn't need to be taken up with support structure"
p21009
aS" The negative side being, you can't really make it bigger (as they've only released a megablocking 4+ set with the right piece, and its the wrong color)"
p21010
aS' I also like how its wide, meaning you can fit LOADS of minifigs on the main deck'

aS' My only gripe is the design of the top cabin'
p21053
aS' When you want to open it up, you have to remove the mast'
p21054

aS' After opening the box we find a single instruction booklet Inside the instruction booklet Now we come to the man in the black visor the Mark I Blacktron and black and industrial he look'
p21224
aS' In my opinion I think he probably has the second best Lego Space torso'
p21225
aS' Before the focus group decided they needed to be brighter Now turning to the walker itself, it?s a simple build which I don?t think even I with my great skills for messing up could get wrong'

p21241
aS' A set which in my opinion showcases what Lego was about in the 1980?s'
p21242
aS' The set has an excellent design ethic and looks great, with very limited parts it retains great action and functionality'
p21243
aS' Twinned with the great main model you?re shown that there are a number of other great models you can make with the same parts'

p21271
aS' Not so ready to take on the empire was he? So overall we have a well designed model, which is in my opinion far superior to the original we were offered with Darth Vader way back when Lego Star Wars was new'
p21272
aS' This Y-wing is sleek and looks great in my opinion, the firing missiles are also a great touch'

aS' So finally the answers to the questions youve no doubt want to know is the set worth the price'
p21278
aS' Ill be frank 39'
p21279
aS'99 is too much for this set'
p21280
aS' Despite this I currently have a squadron of three Y-wings, the reasons is this set has been on sale a number of times at 30 its certainly worth the money'
p21281
aS' Lego recently placed them online with a price of 20, this I think was a great price for the set and well work picking one or more up if you wanted to start your own rebellion'
p21282
aS'Thanks for the review'
p21283
aS" I'll add it to the index"
p21284
aS' The Y-wing is one of my favourite Rebel fighters and this set justifies the coolest fighter'
p21285
aS'A wonderful set and a really charming design, well detailed and pretty smooth at the same time'
p21286
aS' Perhaps that small gap at the cockpits an a little weak point, but we can always MOD a little'

aS'I like the model, it is one of the best rebel sets out there'
p21332
aS" But I don't like it that there is no landing gear"
p21333
aS' When you set this one on the floor/ your rebel base it looks like it crashed or something and looses its look of superiority actually quite fast'
p21334
aS' It needs to be at least 2 studs high, if not more, from the ground'
p21335
aS' TLC is in these days afraid of flimsy landing gear, as they gave to us in the early SW time'
p21336
aS' Now they want something sturdy for playability'
p21337
aS' But I think there should have been some details on the bottom, especially a landing gear that unfolds'
p21338

p21339
aS' The old yellow version of Gold Leader even had a headgear'

aS' I hope TLC realised this year that we want more detailed faces'
p21341
aS' Well, the licenced sets we got proved that, but who knows'
p21342
aS' The upsides of this set are the amount of pieces and detail, especially the engines were fun to build and perhaps the most interesting construction I have seen in years'
p21343
aS' Also it is big, bulky and looks sleek at the same time, just wonderful'
p21344
aS' And next to the 4502 X-Wing it looks in the perfect size! I gave this the highest rating, even if the underside disappoints'
p21345

aS' The instructions to help you through the build'
p21409
aS' Now the reason you probably bought the set, well at least why I did the Knight'
p21410
aS' This features the new torso for 2008 and is the height of fashion'
p21411
aS' This brings the number of printed torsos from the Crown Knights to three, which allows for a greater variety in building your armies'

aS' A new fashion sensation and all the must have accessories for this season'
p21413
aS' With a more heavily armoured look hes ready for anything'
p21414
aS' The rest of the set is a weapons rack, I assume that once youve got a few of these set youll probably like me give up building them and part them out'
p21415
aS' But anyway here are some pictures of what the rest of the elements are spent on'
p21416
aS' A long and complex build begins'
p21417
aS' After 360 hour finally its finished sadly five minfigs were hurt in the construction of this rack'
p21418
aS' Now the money shot, where we can see it all come together'
p21419
aS' It looks great even the rack doesnt look to bad'
p21420
aS' Sadly are hero wasnt ready for other themes just yet'
p21421
aS' In total we have a good army builder which castle fans have wanted'
p21422
aS' However there remains a question in my mind as to if this set is good enough on its own'
p21423
aS' Without any other castle sets I cant see it being to much fun so its not a good present'

p21431
aS' So lets answer the question, is it the army all castle fans have wanted? Well yes and no is the answer'
p21432
aS' While it is a great set and at the now reduced UK price of 2'
p21433
aS'00 amazing value'
p21434
aS' I still think its inferior compared with the army building capability of Cross Bow attack, I much prefer army building both factions at once'

p21461
aS' This set is yet another in a long line of Lego digger and to be honest its not the best in my opinion'
p21462
aS' I still hold nostalgic memories for 6504 which I still think is a great digger'
p21463
aS' From my point of view the set sits to high off the ground and make me wonder how the worker gets in'
p21464
aS' I really dont like the digging arm action it will never be smooth and while it poses better I just think its inferior'
p21465
aS' Despite this I still think its not a bad set, Id just like it to be so much more'

aS' I think that I would only recommend this set to anyone who wants the yellow, and hardcore Exo-force fans'

p21514
aS'Thanks for the review, ~VBBN~'
p21515
aS' I have to say, EF has never really caught my attention, but this set seems alright'
p21516
aS' To be honest, when I saw the topic title, I was expecting a tiger- looking mech'
p21517
aS' The mech itself is cool, except for the huge leg pieces'
p21518
aS' I think the minifigs are great in EF sets, with the dark colored outfits, like dark red or dark green'
p21519
aS'Thanks for that good review, ~VBBN~'
p21520
aS' Thats really a fine and pretty solid looking mecha'
p21521
aS' I think that the designers did a good job on this last wave of EF sets, and the inclusion of these mini robots was also a pretty smart idea!'
p21522
aS'Nice to see a well done review'
p21523
aS" This set is one of the few Exo-Force sets I haven't built myself yet, but I will get it on sale, guess soon"
p21524
aS" I'm do not like the use of Slizer-style ball-joints in Exo-Force, even though they are modified to 2x2 bricks"
p21525
aS' In this particular set I think the arms look weak, and they lack elbow joint like the "green 2008 mech" set'
p21526
aS' (forgot name of this years green mech)'
p21527
aS' Quite a shame, I find it really hurts the functionality of that "green" set and could imagine the same with the "Tiger"'
p21528
aS' I guess with the new pyramide brick as cockpit, the cockpit is still open from the sides and the back'
p21529
aS' I modified my "green 2008 mech", which use the same cockpit design, with a few green bricks, and it is now completely closed from all sides'
p21530
aS' I rate the Tiger at average, but I may change my mind when I get to build it myself'
p21531
aS' Front'
p21532
aS'This was my first Exo Force set and I was quite skeptical towards the mecha theme, so I got it because it seemed to have nice parts'
p21533
aS' It turned out however that the mechas are quite nice :) I really like the poseability of it and since then I got another EF set'
p21534
aS'Thanks for the review!!! One of the best sets in the entire line'
p21535
aS'the assult tiger is pretty cool'
p21536
aS"Since my last post I've had the chance to build the Tiger, and I was surprised in a good way"
p21537
aS' A much better set than I actually thougth'
p21538
aS' Front'
p21539
aS'I just bought 2 of them since they were 5$ each from lego'
p21540
aS' I really wish they did not cancel this series'
p21541
aS'I voted "average"'
p21542
aS' I think this is the least attractive among the 2008 Exo-Force sets'
p21543
aS' I saved my money to buy some of the 2006 Mechas'
p21544
aS'I think this is almost the best set in the exo force line'
p21545
aS' I really like the orange cockpit peice'

p21554
aS' Now for whats inside'
p21555
aS' The contents of the box, it doesnt look like much'
p21556
aS' Now for the troll himself, Im glad they selected this troll torso rather than the other one for the impulse set I think this one is the superior one'
p21557
aS' Also he comes well armed with a spear and sword but no shield sadly'
p21558
aS' Someone really needs to look at the rodent problem in the Castle sets'
p21559
aS' Now the cart, nice easy construction as with all impulse sets, Im still not convinced by the flicking missiles'
p21560
aS' A line of those would do some damage'
p21561
aS' What an oncoming army can expect to see'
p21562
aS' All together now and it looks rather good'
p21563
aS' So there we have it a cheap way of bolstering the troll army and outfitting them with some more weapons'

p21569
aS') Grand Total 34/50 (Lack of a shield and to small to stand alone for my rating system'
p21570
aS') Conclusion'
p21571
aS' Castle fans got a great army builder with The Knight and theyve been lucky enough to receive another one with this set'
p21572
aS' Im glad weve got a troll impulse as it allow for enlarging the armies of evil some the Crown Knight dont totally outnumber all their opponents'
p21573
aS'Best Impulse set so far'
p21574
aS' Thanks for sharing your thoughts and yes, someone should look into that rodent issue'
p21575
aS" I'll add this to the index within long"
p21576
aS'Good review'
p21577
aS' I got 2 of those'
p21578
aS" Wheels are very useful, especially if you don't have any :) As for shields - I don't imagine trolls use them too much"
p21579
aS' I think that they fight berserk style - all out assault'
p21580
aS' One complaint is the piece that the wheels are attached to - its a single piece, with smaller than the standard pin connection'
p21581
aS' So you cant change the width of the cart for your MOCs using the wheels'
p21582
aS" I don't know if a piece with such a connection only on one side exists though "
p21583

p21584
aS" Agreed, I love this little sets, I can't wait for it to hit shops here"
p21585
aS' The rodent problem is funny but I lov always getting more animals, so that is a plus'
p21586
aS' The cart is a nicely formidable machine that I will keep together so I can maximise their fire power'
p21587
aS' The troll figure is one of my favourite ever too, I love that torso and helmet, and I want that sword in grey, I only have it in bronze'
p21588
aS' Thanks for the review! Batbrick Away!'

aS'Thanks for the interview, i nearly forgot this set is out yet'

p21592
aS'Wow'
p21593
aS' I like this set'
p21594
aS' But have no money to get it'
p21595

aS' The regular sized green guys (such as is included with this set) are Trolls'
p21600
aS' Yes, they look like Orcs but LEGO calls them Trolls'
p21601
aS"Nice review! I never new trolls had fireworks, at least that's what it looks like to me"
p21602
aS' Maybe I shall build a trollish fireworks company! Fireworks on!'
p21603
aS"I'm not really impressed by this set as much as other impulse sets"
p21604
aS' The Knight impulse set #5615 offers more in my opinion since it gives two helmets, two weapons, a shield and an armor piece along with the weapon rack'
p21605
aS" I'm not a fan in the slightest of flickfire missles and projectiles like on the cart, and the previously mentioned one piece axle limits the wheel usage in other MOCs"
p21606
aS" I would've liked to see an added chest armor piece at the very least and a shield would've made this great"
p21607
aS" Those things are so rare and it would've bumped the piece count up to 21 to match the Knight set"
p21608
aS" Since both are showing the same price on S@H(in US dollars at least), it would've made sense"
p21609
aS'Thank you for the nice review'
p21610
aS' The set is not that bad, but a shield would be a nice addition'
p21611
aS" I also don't like the flickfire missile"
p21612
aS" A camp site with a fire and a chickenleg would also be nice about the rat; Isn't it just foodsupply for the troll? The only problem would than be that the food is running away"

p21633
aS' This isnt a set Id necessarily buy, but while I was at Bluewater today I decided I should try to review every impulse set myself, so that why I bought it'
p21634
aS' Still I think it has some good playability and a good set of accessories if you need more firefighting kit, I just cant get passed the lack of breaking apparatus, that would have made it a better set in my view'

aS' Now the finished set! First we have the attack truck The truck looks very good'
p21762
aS' It looks very military like with the colors and the design'
p21763
aS' It is designed wonderfully with really nice mudguards and a well-detailed front'
p21764
aS' The only fault of this is I think the top part where the gunner stands is a bit bare'

p21766
aS' The front ridged piece works well here'

aS' The actual area where the guy stands is pretty bare, but not too bad'
p21770
aS' Backside of the truck The spare tire here is a simple, but nice touch'
p21771
aS' A side view The mudguards are smartly built by clipping wing flaps on to handle plates'
p21772
aS' This part gets a bit tedious, but the end result is worth it'
p21773
aS' The big boy cargo truck! This is another really well built truck'
p21774
aS' It has a lot of the same design elements as in the smaller truck, such as the mudguards'
p21775
aS' Front view The front of this truck is as nice or better than the other truck'
p21776
aS' It uses good SNOT building, and everything fits in well'
p21777
aS' A close-up view of the tire area Just behind the tire you can see those silver 1x1s being used as the suspension'
p21778
aS' This is a really nice addition and it looks great'
p21779
aS" NOTE: It's only visual suspension"
p21780
aS' It is not supposed to work'
p21781
aS' The canvas cover in action Now the canvas attaches by putting the holes in the canvas, on some little blue technic pins and then clamping them down with the hinged pieces'

p21874
aS' Why do they make us wear those silly hats anyway'

aS' This is a nice set that I can definitely recommend and I think TLG should certainly release a post office to go with this and the Air Mail set'

p21883
aS'Good review, thanks! For the mail van, while it certainly adds interaction and fun to a LEGO town, it alone lacks details and playability, and thus not a good set, especailly taking its price into consideration'
p21884
aS' Its value is pretty much just like, if not less than, some impulse sets, in my opinion'
p21885
aS'It\'s a good set, but I think the first sticker shouldn\'t say "7731"'

p21887

aS" I don't hate the piece, but I did object to the way this set fills in the middle recessed area with a 2 x 2 plate that is nearly impossible to get out again without doing some damage to it"

p21956
aS' It looks like a fun little beach set'
p21957
aS' The new Coast Guard theme is very nice! EDIT: This set could almost pass for Classic Town, except for the use of orange and the lack of opening doors on the car'
p21958

p21970
aS'Thanks for this review'
p21971
aS' I was thinking of getting this set and having read your review went out today and got it'
p21972
aS' What a great little set'
p21973
aS' What I particularly like: Very sturdy build'
p21974
aS" Feels very solid as you build the pickup (compared to the Fire pickup & trailer I also have) The orange pieces (my first pieces in this colour!) The tyres which give the smoothest ride of any Lego Town/City vehicle I've ever built The raised suspension and side runners The Coast Guard dude (again a first for me) and his mega-cool flippers and aqualung The jetski controls - The handlebars actually move left to right which is a great detail Little details that Lego didn't have to do (the grey handle by the ball joint; moving handlebars; the new tyres) As you can probably guess, I have voted Outstanding for this set!

aS'Thanls for the review, I was looking at this set last time I went to the Lego store, but in the end decided not to get it'

p21988
aS' I just finished building mine yesterday, and I love it'
p21989
aS' But here is one suggestion'
p21990
aS' Trim the large sticker that goes on the roof of the vehicle by cutting along the angles at the front of the sticker'
p21991
aS' If you use it as it is, it will extend beyond the "flat" surface of the roof and will overlap the lower sections'
p21992
aS' Past experience with stickers has suggested that this sticker will "lift" at the front corners'
p21993
aS' Lego stickers are probably the best that there are, but sometimes modifications must be made'

p22020
aS") Pieces: 123 Minifigs: 5 Off we go! Unfortunately, I don't have the box because I didn't like the idea of spending over $50 for a set with under 200 pieces"
p22021
aS' So sorry, no box pics'
p22022
aS' Instructions I think the image on the front is very good'
p22023
aS' It seems less setup somehow than the instructions these days'
p22024
aS' It looks more like someone snuck up on them while they were going about their duties and snapped away rather than something that was planned'
p22025
aS' The Parts A nice selection here'
p22026
aS' There is a pretty good amount of printed pieces in this set which is always nice'
p22027
aS' For example, the zebra print tile, as well as the pirate flag nowadays would almost certainly be stickered'
p22028
aS' The set also comes with a nice dark grey BURP and a red boat for the Pirates'
p22029
aS' The Minifigs The main buying point of this set for me were the minifigs'
p22030
aS' This set comes with 5 of them which is quite good for a small set like this, especially when compared to the sets of today'
p22031
aS' The set comes with 1 alligator, 2 Pirates, 2 Islander Warriors and King Kahuka himself'
p22032
aS" I really like the Islanders' torso and leg prints"
p22033
aS' The leafy skirts are a nice touch and the make-up on the faces is superb'
p22034
aS' Some Parts I Liked These shields have a nice design on them and I always like the treasure chests'
p22035
aS" A Picture Inside The Manual This is a feature that I liked in the manual, it shows an overhead view of the baseplate so it's much easier to find where to put the piece"
p22036
aS" I certainly could have used this feature in last year's Aquabase Invasion set"
p22037
aS' A Close-Up Of The King The face print is nice'
p22038
aS" I wonder who Kahuka's make-up artist is"
p22039
aS" The finished set! First, The Pirates' Boat The boat is really nice"
p22040
aS' The sail is made out of a nice cloth, and connects simply to the mast'
p22041
aS' And now, the main part of the set, the throne! This is a really nice model'
p22042
aS' I think the colors and the design make it really feel like a different part of the LEGO world'
p22043
aS' The rock sculpture looks fantastic as well'
p22044
aS' The throne, which is sort of a stretcher thing attaches here'
p22045
aS' It connects on a 1x2 tile with a stud in the middle for easy removal Here is the treasure that the Pirates seek The treasure rests on tiles inside of the rock'
p22046
aS' The zebra print tribal drum This is simple but nice'
p22047
aS" One thing that's great about this which I mentioned earlier, is that this and all of the other pieces with designs on them are printed"
p22048
aS" That's right, no stickers to be found here! I have used these zebra-print tiles many times for MOCs, as they make a great exotic detail piece"
p22049
aS' The lovely rock head I think this is wonderful'
p22050
aS' It really adds a lot to the set'
p22051
aS' It is well built with grey slopes, curved pieces for the mouth and nose, headlight bricks for the eyes and feathers and horns for detail'
p22052
aS' The backside The complete set! Overall, this looks great in my opinion with great landscaping and some fun parts'
p22053
aS' Well, it looks like the Pirates walked all over the Islanders and stole their treasure'
p22054
aS' In fact, it looks like it was pretty brutal'
p22055
aS' Brickshelf Folder Now, for the the ratings! Price: 8/10 (for $17 not a great price per piece value'
p22056
aS' But when you add 5 figs in, it makes it a decent price'
p22057
aS" Plus this set hasn't been in stores for 14 years so that adds some cost) Parts: 9/10 (The set has some really nice printed parts, as well as a baseplate, which in my opinion, is great) Design: 9/10: (No flaws that I can think of right away"
p22058
aS' The rock face is very well built) Playability: 8/10 (Not really anything to play with, although you can sail the ship and steal the treasure) Build: 9/10 (Rock face uses nice techniques and the rest of the set is simple but looks good) Minifigs: 10/10 (The minifigs are just fantastic'
p22059
aS' Great prints, and just overall fun'
p22060
aS' Overall: 53/60 Bricklink Entry Peeron Brickset It looks like the Pirates have picked up a new recruit from the island'
p22061
aS" Summary The older LEGO sets have a really different look to them than the new sets, and I think it's nice to have a mix of new and old"
p22062
aS' This is definitely a great set with a nice build and great minifigs'
p22063
aS' Add to this the great printed pieces and that old Pirate charm, and you get a very nice set that I can certainly recommend'
p22064
aS' Thanks, and happy building! Edited by Erdbeereis, 17 August 2009 - 02:39 AM'

aS"Erdbeereis1, I've had a quick look your review and I must say it's quite superb! I'm dead tired so I'm going to take a nap but I'll be back later to read it more thoroughly"
p22066
aS'I had to vote outstanding on this set because it simply is, great minifigs, a cool head sculpture and a nice little boat means unlimited playability, great review though man!'
p22067
aS"As I've already said somewhere on this forum, this is the largest Islander set I own and therefore my favourite"
p22068
aS' Thankyou for your great review'
p22069
aS" I picked mine up for only 5 pounds along with Crocodile Cage and King Kahuka, but I can't help you with the original price"
p22070
aS" I would search the web but I'm too tired right now"
p22071
aS'What a great review of an excellent set'
p22072
aS' I love the Islanders and that drum (outstanding!)'
p22073
aS' I think these Islander sets never got the credit they dserved'
p22074
aS" I really like this set and it's a great addition to the Pirate collection"
p22075
aS'I feel the same way about the Islanders sets Brickster'
p22076
aS' They are a nice change from the regular pirate versus soldiers that is the norm'
p22077
aS' I think it would be interesting to see some new Islanders sets released in the new pirate line to see how TLC would make them'
p22078
aS'What a wonderful review with smart (showing the right parts) and clear pictures'
p22079
aS' Fantastic job Erdbeereis1! This set is interesting for several reasons'
p22080
aS' First of all it contains a large amount of (very) useful minifigs'
p22081
aS' Not many sets of this size contain so much figs'
p22082
aS' Secondly, the throne itself can be easily combined with the other Islander sets or even with other pirate and non-pirate sets'
p22083
aS" I'm going to see if I can get this one for a reasonable price on eBay"
p22084
aS'Great review, well done for sure!! I love these reviews of old set, and this one is especially unique'
p22085
aS' I must agree with you the color scheme is magnificent'
p22086
aS' Makes me want to go to ebay and buy it now! To bad for Spongebob though, he got in with a real bad crowd'
p22087
aS'Excellent review! I want this set now!'
p22088
aS'Thanks for the great review'
p22089
aS" This set is pretty standard as Islanders go, but it is such a cool subtheme that I don't care a bit"
p22090
aS' I totally agree with your comment about old and new sets'
p22091
aS" I don't think I would enjoy Lego as much if I didn't have a decent amount of kits from pre 1999"
p22092
aS'Another very nice review, and im glad to see it has some nice pieces as well as characters too'
p22093
aS' Looks to me that no one on BL has it in Australia for sale so I may pass on this beauty'
p22094

p22095
aS' He makes an appearance in my Medium entry'
p22096

p22097
aS' I may hunt for it on ebay'
p22098
aS"An outstanding set because who doesn't love islanders"
p22099
aS' Outstanding review as well'
p22100
aS"An outstanding set, too bad that I couldn't get this set set when it came out "
p22101
aS'Very solid set'
p22102
aS' 5 minifigs and plenty of weapons to go around, adding up to great playability, what more could you want? (aspecially from a set this size) Only I would have liked another cutlass, a musket (instead of 1 of the pistols) and for 1 of the pirates to have another head, but those things are no big deal, it is still a lot better than sets nowadays'

p22105
aS'Well, for some weird reason I missed this before, so I tell you now: very good review (as we are used of you, Erdbeereis1)'
p22106
aS" I like all the Islander sets, and own quite a few myself! For people that don't own any of the Islander sets yet, the 6262 King Kahuka's Throne is a great way to start! Lots of minifigs and accessories!"
p22107
aS'Well, this is a not so old set and i bet most of you already have it'
p22108
aS' So here is another review from me'
p22109
aS' As usual, let us start off with the box art'
p22110
aS' Box art: I like the box art'
p22111
aS' They put a nice background for the AT-AP'
p22112
aS' At the side we have the minifigs scale and at the back there is the function shown and advertisement for other set'
p22113
aS' The content: The content is consist of 6 packets of bricks and a instruction book'
p22114
aS' Yeap, no sticker sheet'
p22115
aS' Instruction book: The instruction books not only show us the steps but also show us all a clear pictures of the January release sets and some sets show with their function'
p22116
aS' Well, this includes the AT-AP functions as well'
p22117
aS' Besides, there are bricks checklist as well and the how do you start off before assemble your sets and a little poster where the clones with their AT-AP battling the Droids'
p22118
aS" Here's a random page"
p22119
aS' New pieces (to me): I never see both of this piece before so I assume it is a new pieces'
p22120
aS' Anyone have any idea is there any other sets that contains this piece? The blasters: We are given a 2 long blasters which is great'
p22121
aS' Which I it is more accurate as most of the Clone troopers use a long blaster'
p22122
aS" The minifigs: The minifigs is 2 Shock Trooper but is different with #7655 clone troopers battle packs's Shock Trooper"
p22123
aS' The leg is different in colour, we are given white hip while the one in the battle pack are given a black hip'
p22124
aS' Furthermore, we get a new printed headgear, which I think they have improve it, check out the mouth printing, the colour is brighter'
p22125
aS' So here is the headgear: The headgear limit itself from turning to the side this is because the front part it is too low until it block by the torso'
p22126
aS' The Shock Troopers: Without helmet on: We are given a black stud, no face printed'
p22127
aS' How I wish that I have extra'
p22128
aS" With helmet on: Comparison with Shock Troopers from Battle Pack: The AT-AP: Here's the AT-AP"
p22129
aS' It looks ugly at a certain angle and looks great in a certain angle'
p22130
aS' Anyway I still like the set'
p22131
aS' I like the walker vehicle'
p22132
aS' Below are the pictures taken randomly: Top view: Side view: Without stabilizer leg: With stabilizer leg: Rear view: The Functions: Well, the functions are not so impressive'
p22133
aS' Just something turning around, open here and there'
p22134
aS' The only function that is say as special is the retractable stabilizer leg'
p22135
aS' The cockpit: The cockpit can fit two Clone Troopers but too bad we are only given two and is not enough as there is no gunner on top'
p22136
aS' Inside it there is a guns holders, which can hold two guns but fall off easily when you are trying to remove the guns'
p22137
aS' Well the other side have some speedometre thing and a controller'
p22138
aS' To reveal the cockpit, you have to open the top hatch'
p22139
aS" Look below: so you can see what's inside: Oops, the side hatch and back hatch as well: Open and close: I think this pieces is use not to let you open the hatch but to make some design, I mean make it able to move inside"
p22140
aS' With Clones: Beneath: So this is the pieces that hold the stabilizer leg when is not in use'
p22141
aS' This is how the stabilizer leg move: At last~ And of course the revealing cockpit from below and at the back'
p22142
aS' Guess the droids have alternative way to take this things down faster'
p22143
aS' The leg: There are pieces blocking the leg to go to the front I mean overhead and lose balance'
p22144
aS' The base in not movable The side armor: The side armor has door and this is how it is attach'
p22145
aS' It is very flimsy, when you want to adjust it to be a little steep to creat the shape, they might just fall off'
p22146
aS' So it is connected to the body with just a technic pin'
p22147
aS' and to hold it properly, here is the support: The side hatch: It open and close easily, very loose, nothing to hold it tight'
p22148
aS" Here's some view when the side hatch is open"
p22149
aS' The cannon: The cannon on top is movable and adjustable'
p22150
aS' The big cannon can move up and down while the smaller one can cove sideways'
p22151
aS' But the smaller one tend to lose balance when it is without minifigs, means the one on top and below will not b align'
p22152
aS' This is the pieces that only enable it to move up and down'
p22153
aS' To prevent it from moving freely, LEGO put two pieces to block it'
p22154
aS' Completion: I try to make the sets looks great'
p22155
aS' I think this angle is right'
p22156
aS' Spare parts: It is so few compare with #7673 Magna Guard Starfighter and it is more expensive'
p22157
aS' Overall: This set is not really a good set'
p22158
aS' The hatch is quite flimsy, top and the side since there is nothing to hold them tight'
p22159
aS' Besides, it is lack of one clone'
p22160
aS' But to complete your walker collection, you must have it'
p22161
aS' Pros: -no sticker needed -new improved headgear -long balsters Cons: -lack of clone -flimsy -expensive as few pieces are given] Hope you guys like it'

p22198
aS' The same issue concerns for example the AT-AT, The Twilight and the AT-TE (plus more sets)'
p22199
aS' What annoys me in this set is the use of the 2 tan 4x8 plates'
p22200

aS' Includes Commander Fox, Clone Trooper, Battle Droid, Super Battle Droid and Battle Droid Commander minifigures! Rotate the laser cannon on top! Laser cannon underneath bends to change direction! Measures 6" (15cm) tall and 10" (27cm) wide! Also known as the homing spider droid, this is what I would usually reckon as a mini-fig set if not for the high price point'

p22265
aS' This set is really either a miss or a hit'
p22266
aS" For me, it's a hit, due to the mini-fig count, and the wide array of accessories"
p22267
aS" It's going to probably be a hit depending on the movie that's coming out this month, since we have commander fox here(I heard that C"

aS' :D Comments: This review was done immediately after the Launch of the clone wars toys at the midnight launch on 26 July on a local starwars fan forum'
p22271
aS' And after having caught the movie only yesterday, I now only have this to say, "It\'s not part of the movie!?!"'

p22330
aS' All built This set took me forever to build'
p22331
aS' I had to take numerous breaks as it was the toughest, longest build I have ever faced! For an impulse set, this actually looks pretty good'
p22332
aS' The owl perch is nice, also the crystal ball table'
p22333

aS'Good review for a simple set'
p22341
aS' While it does come with the basics for an impulse set, I just feel that it lacks something though I am not sure what'
p22342
aS' Perhaps a printed magic scroll? I am still not a fan of the printed cap (especially the stars), but I do like the printed pants displaying his various goodies hanging from his belt'
p22343
aS' The plain torso is to be expected from a wizard minifig I suppose'
p22344
aS" Overall, it's not a bad set but it certainly feels to be lacking something, IMO"
p22345
aS'Thanks for the review'
p22346
aS' I love this impulse set, I bought two of them so I could make a Wizard and his apprentice'

p22369
aS' Now for what?s inside'
p22370
aS' The contents of the box, the impulse sets never look that inspiring'
p22371
aS' Now for the alien, I have to say I?m not impressed'
p22372
aS' I?m not a big space fan and I only bought this due to my impulse review challenge, but as the main point of the impulse sets is the alien is a little hard to build a good set round something with one point or articulation'
p22373
aS' It lacks what make Lego minfigs so great their articulation'
p22374
aS' Now for the space vehicle, as always with impulse a short and easy build ensues'
p22375
aS' Took maybe 2 mins at the most'
p22376
aS' Time to mount the alien in his craft'
p22377
aS' The craft looks a little wide for him'
p22378
aS' Slightly better from this angle but still not winning any awards'
p22379
aS' I?m disappointed of the impulse sets I?ve reviewed so far this is clearly the weakest of them, but what really disappointing is the other seem so good and useful'
p22380
aS' The Rating System Figures: 3/10 (The alien is not a good minfig) Parts 6/10 (Some interesting parts but nothing that special'
p22381

p22384
aS') Grand Total 21/50 (Less than half marks the lowest I?ve given so far'
p22385
aS') Conclusion'
p22386
aS' In many ways I?m annoyed, from the outside of the box this set looks quite interesting and certainly appears to be well designed'
p22387
aS' The idea of a small alien fighter/flying craft is in my opinion a good one, but sadly when you?ve got the finished product in your hand it looks nothing like the box art'
p22388
aS' While I think Mission Mars had some interesting sets and I might still get some of them this one will not be a repeat purchase for me'
p22389
aS"Well set out review with alot of great content! Gotta ask you though, how does the set look nothing like the box art? With so few pieces I'd have thought one could mentally put it together given the box front"
p22390
aS'Im not a great communicator but what I was trying to say was that on the box the sets looks quite exciting and well made and that the Alien fits much more snugly than it does'
p22391
aS' So I was a bit disappointed that it seemed wider and less compact and certainly less exciting when I opened it,'
p22392
aS'well now we at least know that we can avoid that set ;) Johan'
p22393
aS'Worst set of the year? Worst set of all time? The pictures say it all, no ratings necessary'
p22394
aS' A waste of paper for box and instructions, and waste of plastic for bag and jelly alien'
p22395
aS' The little alien ship that comes with the Switch Fighter beats this one hands down, as well as any other LEGO spaceship I have ever seen and I have seen many'
p22396
aS" Thankfully this set isn't available in my country, which is something I never thought I would say"
p22397
aS' Anyway, I hope TLG makes these awful jelly aliens disappear forever after this year'
p22398
aS'Thanks for the review'
p22399
aS' Considering the price, I give it "Below Average"'
p22400
aS" I didn't buy any of the space impulse sets as I don't think they are good value"
p22401
aS'Thanks for this review'
p22402
aS' As for the set? Well, I am not to crazy about this set, But I want some sort of small alien fleet vehicals, and this would work well'
p22403

p22406

p22407
aS' In fact, this is the only impulse set which I do not have it at all'
p22408
aS' After looking at your wonderful review, I am going to give it a "2" and actually consider it to buy at least one to complete the entire impulse set series'
p22409
aS" I don't really like the design and the alien at all"
p22410
aS' In fact, I prefer the Mars Mission astronaunt more than the aliens'
p22411
aS" I don't really like the set but I like your review"
p22412
aS"I already don't liked the aliens, but if the fighter was better I would already bought him"
p22413
aS' Now I will maybe buy one of it just for the 2 limegreen pieces'
p22414
aS"I rated this poor due to the fact the set is unimaginative (looks like a bunch of plates where thrown together) and it just isn't worth the money LEGO is asking for it, IMO"
p22415
aS' I\'ve never been a fan of the non-articulated "jellies" so I\'ll leave my disgust for them out of this post'
p22416
aS" However, unlike the set, the review is a fine work of art that clearly depicts the goods and provides valuable insight/opinions about the set's playability, usefulness, and overall value"
p22417
aS'Impluse sets are made good by using parts well and minifigs'

p22431
aS' Yep one accessory per person'
p22432
aS' The question is what could you do with this set, I mean it?s just spacemen in a line? Do you see the man who mugged you ma?am?'
p22433

p22437
aS') Conclusion'
p22438
aS' Until the Castle Battle Packs came out this year we?ve been suffering from a lack of minfig based sets, and from this review I think you can see why'
p22439
aS' For many of us and I include myself here Lego minifig are one of the best parts of the hobby and sets like these allowed you to build up a much larger number of figs'
p22440
aS' Lego did well with this set a nice range of figure and also a good selection of accessor'
p22441
aS'You you got it mint in sealed box? It indeed is a nice set'
p22442
aS' I am not into Space, but nevertheless this set is a good addition if you need to get your space environment a little bit more crowded'
p22443
aS' LEGO however is planning to release a minifig set again next year (city) and of course the advent calendars are also quite nice to get some figs with accessories'

aS'99 GBP Brickset Hello everyone, today I will review the extremely underrated Hailfire Tank and Spider Droid set'
p22466
aS' I hope this review does it justice'
p22467
aS" So, let's start with the box: NOTE: This picture is not mine"
p22468
aS' Standard box for Star Wars in that time'
p22469
aS" The background on the box looks like it's from Geonosis, indicating that this set is from Episode II, and not III or the Clone Wars"
p22470
aS' The back of the box (not shown) shows the playability functions and some other sets that were released at the same time as this'
p22471
aS' Overview Here is an overview of the whole set'
p22472
aS' It comes with one construction manual and no sticker sheets ( )'
p22473
aS' This is a very simple set, but with not much to it, it is still a very important part of the CIS army, especially if you are interested in army building'
p22474
aS' I like to call this set a "super battle pack", and you\'ll find out why soon'
p22475
aS" Let's get right to it, and look at the feature of the set: the Hailfire Tank"
p22476
aS' Front A front view of the very cool tank'
p22477
aS' Here you can see two triangular shields on the hull'
p22478
aS" The main body is very simple, but altogether very effective and clever, and making it really look like a hailfire tank, although a little bit sized down from it's movie version"
p22479
aS' The trans-red stud used as the "eye" makes the tank look more menacing'
p22480
aS' Side The side view'
p22481
aS" The wheels are very easy to make, but it's a real pain to connect all of those chain links together"
p22482
aS" I don't see what you could use the links for, except for another tank, but maybe someone creative will find something for these"
p22483
aS' The dark tan is nice though'
p22484
aS' The wheels are held on by Technic poles, and the tank rolls on the wheels fairly well on carpet or a hard surface'
p22485
aS' Back This is the back of the tank'
p22486
aS" Here you can see eight flick-fire missiles (four on each side) of the new type, so they don't easily fall out"
p22487
aS' Also note the modified 2x2 with extended hole piece sticking out of the back'
p22488
aS' This may be used to easily push around the tank'
p22489
aS' I just wish you could fit a droid in the body for the cockpit'
p22490
aS' Now we move on to the Spider Droid, or what I like to call "The Dwarf Spider": The front'
p22491
aS' This one is also simple, but very cleverly built'
p22492
aS' The main body is two semi-spheres connected together for rotation, and an antenna, a cannon, four legs, and eyes made out of a useful telephone piece'
p22493
aS' The picture speaks for itself as far as how the gun and eyes are built'
p22494
aS' Side A side view'
p22495
aS' You can now see the legs better, which are more sturdy then you would think'
p22496
aS' Each one is made out of two pearl bronze Exo-force robot arms, a useful bley handgun piece, and a dark bley battle droid body, all connected to the under body (a big knob-like piece)'
p22497
aS' Back The back'
p22498
aS' Not much to say here'
p22499
aS' I like this spider droid because it is very sturdy, and the legs are easy to adjust'
p22500
aS' Finally, we look at the minifigs: There are four minifigs in this set, which is quite generous for a set of this size'
p22501
aS' It comes with a yellow battle droid commander (I really like this one), two battle droids, and a super battle droid'
p22502
aS' All three battle droids have the new blaster pistols and one twisted arm'
p22503
aS" That's about it for the review, so here is the FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, Very fun and easy, besides the chain links"
p22504
aS' Should take the seasoned builder less than 20 minutes'
p22505
aS' Playability: 7/10, the flick-fire missiles are fun, as well as just zooming around the tank'
p22506
aS' Could use some clones for a battle'
p22507
aS' Swooshability: 8/10, you can roll around the hailfire fairly well'
p22508
aS' Minifigs: 9/10, a generous amount of figs, and all are pretty good'
p22509
aS' Design: 9'
p22510
aS'5/10, a really simple and clever set, although a little too small for the movie version'
p22511
aS' Price: 10/10, a very fair price considering the price-per-parts ratio and the coolness of the set'
p22512
aS' Overall Score: 8'

aS'5/10, a very neat set to have, a great army builder, and great for display next to all of the other CIS sets'

aS' I think this one of the sets'
p22519
aS' In Europe this thing is waaaay overpriced and thus makes it a crappy set'
p22520
aS' We pay nearly double the US price'
p22521
aS' So I rated it poor'
p22522
aS' Also because the figs included does not make it great'
p22523
aS" The Hailfire is well designed and looks great, but that's just about all there is worthy of a positive mentioning"
p22524
aS' Sorry'
p22525

aS" Thanks! That's my job, I'm a moderator"
p22538
aS'Thanks for the review, JimButcher'
p22539
aS' I really like that set'
p22540
aS' It combines interesting and good design with some awesome cool parts and a neat amount of charm'
p22541
aS'Great review'
p22542
aS' I agree that this set is underrated'
p22543
aS" The Hailfire is supposed to be a little taller than two battle droids, so scale-wise it's nice"
p22544
aS' The dwarf spider droid is amazing in my opinion'
p22545
aS" I just wish it wasn't brown, it makes me feel like it's on Geonosis"
p22546
aS" We never saw a grey varient of the Hailfire, so it's fine with me that it's brown"
p22547
aS'This is a great set, I have 2 of them now, and I plan to get more'
p22548
aS' It is much better than the droid battle pack'
p22549
aS' For 10 bucks more, you get better battle droid arms and some canon "vehicles", good enough for me'
p22550
aS'Thanks for the review'
p22551
aS' Is a great one'
p22552
aS' This set is not really a good set but i like the Spider Droid'
p22553
aS' The Hailfire Droid scale is not right, i think it is suppose to be even bigger'
p22554
aS' anyway, this is the first set that re-release the Commander Droid'
p22555
aS' So i grab it'
p22556
aS'Thanks for the cool review JimButcher '
p22557
aS' Actually, I really like this set, it is small but very clever and even if the hailfire droid is undersized, what in the whole line is not under or oversized '
p22558
aS' The new spider droid is the best small build I have ever done in a set and the droid commander is pretty cool '
p22559
aS' I am happy with the set and I will get another with my comic-con exclusive '
p22560
aS'This is a must have set for AOTC fans and I really love the hailfire droid but it costs like $80 or more now that its discontinued'

p22565
aS' At first glance, this ball on legs may not seem like much, but hopefully this review will change your mind'
p22566
aS' The box'
p22567
aS' This box is the standard for all of the new Clone Wars sets: sleek, shiny, and a right-out-of-the-factory look'
p22568
aS' The blue-and-white color scheme is fantastic, and portrays that the sets are based off of a cartoon well'
p22569
aS' This box has a "LIMITED EDITION" (in Spanish, too! ) seal slapped on the front, although you won\'t have trouble finding this in your local Toys "R" Us, because of the big Clone Wars display in the front of the store that you can\'t miss'
p22570
aS' Overview In this picture, you can see the contents of the whole set (minus the instruction booklet) built'
p22571
aS" You can spot five minifigures (which I'll get to later), and a very tall CIS weapon, known as the Homing Spider Droid"
p22572
aS' This weapon of destruction is a must-have for your CIS army, although the color scheme (mostly dark bley and light bley) is a change up from the regular colors (brown or blue) of the CIS'
p22573
aS" This may have something to do with the blended armies of the Trade Federation and Corporate Alliance, but I don't know for sure"
p22574
aS' The instruction manual is very thin, only about twenty pages'
p22575
aS' Homing Spider Droid This is the main part of the set'
p22576
aS' Four huge legs, two mounted guns, and a red sensor eye are the highlights of this artillery unit'
p22577
aS" There's not many playability factors to this one, but sometimes its just fun to squash the little clones, a change-up of the contrary"
p22578
aS' It also looks good next to all of the other CIS sets, but you might want to clear some room in your display area; the legs take up a lot of room! This thing is also massively tall, about the same height as the Republic Cruiser'
p22579
aS' Main Body This is the main body of the spider, which has no cockpit and is remote controlled'
p22580
aS' This spherical body (not in that sort of way'
p22581
aS') is a very quick build, and features a big, red eye connected by a red stud and hinge'
p22582
aS' Top Gun Here is the top gun (not with Tom Cruise), which is connected to the body using a clever Technic system (pun not intended)'
p22583
aS' As you can see from this picture, you can see that it can rotate a full 360 degrees, but only if you remove the eye'
p22584
aS' Also, the gun can be pulled back, and if you let go, it will snap back, like the a gun does when fired, due to the force of the shot'
p22585
aS" I'm not sure this was intended by TLG, because it wasn't showed anywhere on the box or in the manual"
p22586
aS' Lower Gun Here is the gun attached to the under body of the main part'
p22587
aS' It is attached using a hinge, which allows it to move up and down'
p22588
aS' I also like the cord (that presumably transfers power) included on both guns'
p22589
aS' Hips Here is one of the hips attaching the legs to the body'
p22590
aS' There is one on each side, with two legs each'
p22591
aS' The are attached to the body and legs with Technic pieces'
p22592
aS' Legs You can see the tall legs in this pic'
p22593
aS' They are basically just Technic poles and connectors'
p22594
aS' Feet This is one of the feet, the essential to balancing the whole vehicle'
p22595
aS' These and the legs are repetitive, so I suggest doing them all at the same time to avoid flipping back in the manual and repeating the process three more times'
p22596
aS' The picture speaks for itself for the design of the feet'
p22597
aS' All are connected to the legs using a double-holed Technic piece'
p22598
aS' One Massive Son of a Gun This thing is so tall! It frightens the skin off of even the toughest, most experienced soldiers'
p22599
aS" Run for your Lives!! Look at how much havoc and fear it causes! Family Photo Enough of the battle scenes, here is a shot of this spider with it's smaller cousin: the Dwarf Spider Droid"
p22600
aS' Minifigs Finally, here are the minifigs that come with this set'
p22601
aS" There are five in all, which include: Battle Droid: Nothing special, but still an addition to your army Commander Battle Droid: I love that yellow torso! Super Battle Droid: Again, nothing special Clone Trooper: I'm glad they gave us one in this set, I can add it to to my other Phase 1 clones"
p22602
aS' Commander Fox: I love it! Everything from the dark red markings to the accessories are fantastic! The head is just the regular anime style Clone Wars face'
p22603
aS' This set comes with two flashlights, two antennae, one visor, one pauldron, and one kama'
p22604
aS' Close-up of Fox Here is a close-up of Fox, so you can see the detailed insignia of the Republic Guard'
p22605
aS' That wraps it up for the review, here is the FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, very easy and straightforward, a little repetitive with the legs'
p22606
aS' Should take the seosoned builder around 20 minutes'
p22607
aS" Playability: 6/10, not many play factors, but it's fun to just squash puny clones with this giant arachnid"
p22608
aS" Swooshability: N/A Minifigs: 10/10, you really can't ask for more in this sort of set! Design: 8/10, not very sturdy, but it is altogether clever"
p22609
aS' Price: 5/10, yes, it is limited edition, but pumping up the price fifteen dollars more than it should be is a little ridiculous'
p22610
aS' Overall Score: 8'
p22611
aS'5/10, An excellent set for display, although not very sturdy'
p22612
aS' Minifigs are superb, but the price could be better'
p22613
aS' In the end, I would highly recommend this to any Prequel Trilogy fan looking to build up his/ her army'

aS' Which would be implied, had Jim added the EUR or GBP price in the info[hint hint ] The spider droid is flimsy at best'

aS' Making it stand or even move without tumbling over is hard'
p22619
aS' Also why the brown cylinders on the legs? Keep the colourscheme clean, please'
p22620
aS' The figs are fine, except that I dislike the clone headgear and the fact that the helmets now have holes in the sides, allowing the flesh head to show within = Goofy looking'

p22648
aS' I tought 2007 models were better, and still think 2008 models are the best'
p22649
aS" That basically means 1) It's a shame that there will be no more of this line and 2) this is my first 2006 model, yet I bought in in July 2008"

p22654
aS" Sticker sheet: and they're numbered! Random instructions page: connecting legs to the body Instructions page - sticker detail: that's why they're numbered"
p22655
aS" Instructions page - parts inventory: does anybody check if they're all there before building? Surely not me"
p22656
aS' Loose pieces: nothing rare, I think; small Techinc parts come in different colours, as usual (you often don\'t see them when the model is complete, but sometimes you do) The Iron drone: "strong and durable" (and much better looking than those crappy MM jelly aliens) Building starts'
p22657
aS' The open cockpit - front and rear view Left leg - front and rear view; right leg is built of the same pieces'

aS' Try not to put your fingerprints on the sticky side! Consider using tweezers'
p22665
aS" Posability: both legs and both arms feature three joints; and that's good, so that the weight doesn't have the Sentry falling down"

aS' Polar Explorer Bonus Pack Set #: 6569 Theme: Arctic Year Released: 2000 Piece Count: 76 Minifigs: 2 List Price: $10 (USD) In 2000, Lego introduced a new theme called Arctic'
p22687
aS' It was something completely new and different for Lego as no mini-fig scale sets and/or adventurers had ever ventured to the Arctic'
p22688
aS' The set offered new orange pieces and combined elements of blue and white pieces to provide a number of sleds, vehicles, a mobile outpost (6520), and even a large polar base (6575)'
p22689
aS' The theme was unfortunately short lived and did not see 2001'
p22690
aS' This particular set is a "value pack" that combines sets 6578 (Polar Explorer) and 6586 (Polar Scout) at a reasonable price of $10 (USD)'
p22691
aS' I may have even paid a few dollars less at a discount toy store back in the early 2000s'
p22692
aS' A picture of the "Bonus Pack" with the two sets combined within the box: The backside features an advertisement for the Lego Club and pictures of other Arctic sets: Starting with the smaller set, The Polar Explorer (just a tip of the iceberg ): Instructions Front of Box Back of Box Both sets include the same minifig, an Arctic fig with glasses and a thick arctic coat: Here\'s a shot of the fig with his hood on'
p22693
aS' I always thought the hood is a nice piece that would work well for Hoth Rebel snow scenes'
p22694
aS" The set includes a few nice accessories: The set actually creates a small ice/snow formation that can even be placed on water to represent an iceberg: Here's a close-up with the blue ice spider: The complete set: Next, the Polar Scout: Front of Box Back of Box The Polar Scout instructions picture the same image as the box: But I really like the real arctic imagery on the backside: The set includes a small sheet of decals: Included are some great arctic accessories: And some interesting arctic creatures, like this neon orange scorpion in a ball of ice: I love the polar bear, a great addition to snow scenes: But the best part of this set is the orange and black sled: The back sled attachment (U-Haul) has some tools and a removable storage cover: The top comes off easy to store tools and equipment: Here's the arctic fig with a great metal detector (or other snow research device): And the sled itself: Lastly, a picture of the complete Polar Scout: Final Thoughts: I'm a little disappointed that Arctic was a short-lived theme"
p22695
aS" At the time, I wasn't too interested in the Arctic, but I still regret not buying the large Polar Research Base after seeing it at a discounted price"
p22696
aS' I was able to pick up this set and the Mobile Outpost that I never opened'
p22697
aS" I'd be interesting in reading your thoughts in regard to this set and the Arctic Theme"
p22698
aS"I like the theme very much, but sadly, I don't own any sets of it"
p22699
aS" It brings such a great feeling, it's fresh and has great parts and sets"
p22700
aS' And it brought the polar bear! Your review is very good and informative, thanks! (I voted wrong, I meant above average, but I clicked below average )'
p22701
aS'Thank you for that fine review, TheBrickster! I really like how this two small sets create an intense and adventurous atmosphere against the backdrop of a pretty exotic region'
p22702
aS' The setsre well designed and very nice with a fine amount of rather unique and well fitting gear'
p22703
aS' The whole theme offers a lot of playability in a set-up thats a little different to TLCs standard sceneries for sure'
p22704
aS' And'
p22705
aS" it always reminded me of 'Who Goes There?', too"
p22706
aS'Hi! Great review on one of my favourite themes! I never realized how cool it was until just now, when you did your review'
p22707
aS' Anyways, I remember my one set of the arctict expedition, The Arctic Expedition pack'
p22708
aS'A nice set review'
p22709
aS' As for the theme itself, I though it was a very interesting theme'
p22710
aS' Sadly I dont think Lego put enough effort into it, I was personally upset not to se a second year even if I didnt buy any of the sets'
p22711
aS' It reminds me of the artic theme Playmobil did at one point in the distant past to be honest'
p22712
aS' I think a number of good artic scenes were missed, when it came out a really wanted to get a ski plane but it never came, I built it myself in the end but I dont know how Lego missed that one'
p22713
aS' On a slightly random note I do know that at least one Lego minifig did make it all the way to the real artic with a research team, sadly I dont have any pictures to offer you'
p22714
aS'A very nice review! I really miss the Arctic theme'
p22715
aS" I didn't own any of the sets, but after looking at the pictures in this review and reading the instructions on Brickleys words and Brickfactory, I want them"
p22716
aS"I find it amusing that the numbers on the decal (for the flag) were chosen so that it wouldn't look stupid if you put it on upside-down by accident"
p22717
aS'4645?4?N, 74121?7?W??? Those are some wierd coordinates'
p22718
aS'Nice review Brickster! The Arctic theme is very nice'
p22719
aS' The minifigs have a great look to them especially with the hoods'
p22720
aS' The colors for the Arctic sets I have always liked, and somehow the idea of minifigs exploring the arctic is fun to me'
p22721
aS'Thank you very much for this review, TheBrickster! I voted both times for Outstanding because: I really the Arctic theme'
p22722
aS' I only bought the ice sailor but otherwise no sets because of money and place reasons and because I already collect four themes (City, older Castle, Western and Star Wars Old Triology)'
p22723
aS' But a comeback of the Arctic theme - perhaps as addition to a winter sports and winter rescue theme would be very welcome! I really all sets - the little and the big ones'
p22724
aS' In my opinion they all were very well designed (not too big vehicles, not too little and not minimalitic, great minifigs and very nice and lovely details and accessory)'
p22725
aS' Klaus-Dieter'
p22726
aS'Thanks very much for this great review TheBrickster! I love the Arctic sub-theme, but unfortunately i never got my hands on any of the sets, since this theme had its time during my dark ages'
p22727
aS' This one is a really neat little set with a great amount of accesoires, especially these snow shoes and the backpack which i love'
p22728
aS'Great review, I hope TLC does another'
p22729
aS' I rember reading a book once based on the theme which stated the scorpions and thespiders and such were aliens '
p22730
aS"Wasn't there some years back a film based on aliens in the arctic? Can't remember the name and i think it was really old, but there certainly was going on something with strange creatures and a polar base"
p22731
aS"On this, the first anniversary of the news organization that has become so near and dear to your hearts, EB News is pleased to present a very special feature that we've only added recently: The EB News Review!

p22772
aS" Anyway, every airport need mechanics/engineers to maintain the aircrafts to make sure it's certified to fly"

p22790
aS' It was quite memorable, but then, a short time later, someone new joined the team, bringing it to a new level of polish and bad jokes'
p22791
aS" Still, this tribute isn't dedicated to that genius of the written word, nay, it's dedicated to the whole staff, including the new guy who is still a secret so don't bother asking, I'm not telling! Ha! I salute you, EB News, it's been a damn fine year! I hope I can survive another"

aS'2872 Witch and Fireplace Review Theme: Fright Knights Parts: 18 Figs: 1 Price: Unknown (BrickLink $5'
p22823
aS'00+) Year: 1997 Brickset Peeron Brickshelf Bricklink Ever wanted to turn into a animal, wanted to curse your enemy or just wanted to be rich beyond your wildest dreams'
p22824
aS' You should go visit the Witch and her Fireplace'
p22825
aS' She can brew you up a potion for any occasion or purpose'
p22826
aS' So head down to see the Witch right now'
p22827
aS' Although this set is from the Fright Knights theme it can easily fit in with any other castle theme due to the lack of specialised Fright Knight parts and printings'
p22828
aS' The set comes with no astounding parts but looks like the source for our good magician impulse set from the current castle theme'
p22829
aS' I think I got this as a promo set'
p22830
aS' Official Pic'
p22831
aS' The box art for the set has the standard Fright Knight background and lego system logo followed by the set number'
p22832
aS' Down the left hand side of the box a cat is attempting a head stand'
p22833
aS' Also I think this box display the contents of the set in an attractive set up as usual'
p22834
aS' 1'
p22835
aS' The whole set minifigs and all Here is the witch'
p22836
aS' On the torso there is a spider amulet which is a little hard to make out due to the low res of the image'
p22837
aS' The Witches wand is the same as the Bellville fairy wands except in trans red like a lightsaber blade although it is completely useful as a lightsaber'
p22838
aS" As you have probably noticed the witch has no legs instead she has a slope brick with the dress pattern printed on witch (get it witch-which) looks better than Asajj Ventress' from the new clone wars sets in my opinon"
p22839
aS' (for this anyway) The Fairysaber (new word) duel'
p22840
aS' This is the old run down fireplace of the Witch'
p22841
aS" At the base there are two smouldering coals instead of fire witch (it's not funny any more is it?) doesn't make that much sense seeming as it is a fireplace"
p22842
aS" The little triangular brick on top doesn't really do anything I also accidentally put the wrong one on while building, it should be a sloping brick"
p22843
aS' Here are the coals'
p22844
aS' The old trans orange studs are less translucent than the new ones'
p22845
aS' I like how they have places them above the main baseplate on a 1x2 plate so they are in line with the rest of the fire place other wise it would look wrong'
p22846
aS" Here is everything else I haven't covered yet, the crystal ball, the pets and the magical potion vial"
p22847
aS' The crystal ball is identical to the one included with the Good Wizard impulse form the current castle theme'
p22848
aS' I like the molds for the cat and the bat although if the cat had some yellow printing for the eyes like the white cat had black for the eyes it would be much better'
p22849
aS" I think the trans green tube things are a little uncommon but I'm not worried about that"
p22850
aS' 2'
p22851
aS' Overall Build: 6/10 Extremely puzzling and difficult do not attempt alone '
p22852
aS" It's pretty simple but seeming as it has a load of stuff you can move around it is good"
p22853
aS" Minifigs: 9/10 I really like the witch and it couldn't have really come with anyone else also it came with the wand which is really good too"
p22854
aS' Design: 8/10 It should have come with some fire and maybe some more orange bricks to put at the base'
p22855
aS" Parts: 8/10 The minifigure isn't bad nor are the animals or the trans green part"
p22856
aS' Price: 10/10 I am guessing this was pretty good'
p22857
aS' Seeming as I think I got this as a promo I gave it 10 because it was free'
p22858
aS" Playability: 7/10 As wth all impulse sets there isn't much here but at least it comes with some animals to have a fight with or give the witch rabies"
p22859
aS' Overall: 8/10 If it came with some more stuff for the fire place and the cat was more detailed it would have scored higher but because this set can easily be intergrated with other castle sets it got a mighty 8'
p22860
aS' 3'
p22861
aS' Mini comic ! Hocus pocus magic shocus turn my pets into dinosaurs (not to catchy is it?) *Poof* Oh know I think I might drink my magical potion glug glug glug Oh! my'
p22862
aS'Thank you very much for this review, Skipper 24! I voted for Outstanding since this set is a little but very lovely set'
p22863
aS" I really it (although I don't own it yet ) since it's very similar to today's Impulse sets: a minifig and some nice additional stuff"
p22864
aS' And I like the black cat which gives the set a more gloomy atmosphere'
p22865
aS' Hopefully TLG will include a black cat and a chimney like in this set in the new advent calendar, too'
p22866
aS' Klaus-Dieter'
p22867
aS'I chose above average'
p22868
aS' It has a great minifigure'
p22869
aS' I wish I had it'
p22870
aS'someday I will!'
p22871
aS'You already know how I feel about the review'
p22872
aS" As for the set, I'm not entirely sure"
p22873
aS" It's a fine witch, but you've already gotten her in the Witch's Windship and a few other sets"
p22874
aS' I vote average on this'
p22875
aS' A good minifig (though one does not have the need for more than one witch) and some fine additional parts'
p22876
aS'This is a very good review, no doubt about it'
p22877
aS' About this set, this is a cheap way to buy this set with a witch and some nifty accessories such as the black cat'
p22878
aS' In fact, I think this is the first time I had ever seen a black cat'
p22879
aS" It's simple, but not very useful in my collection"
p22880
aS' Because other Fright Knight sets also offer the witches too'
p22881
aS" I don't need many witches"
p22882
aS' Overall, I feel that this is an average set'
p22883
aS'Yay, another Fright Knights review! Odd comic at the end'

p22890
aS" This is one of the few unpromo Fright Knight sets I didn't get, sadly"
p22891
aS" Not 'sadly' because of Willa the Witch, I have about four of her, but the special cat, and the other bits (one can never have too many Lego bats)"
p22892
aS' I voted the set outstanding, I think it is for its size'

p22962
aS' It looks more grainy and silver'

p22971

p22972
aS' This is probably the best way to make the wheels on this small scale'
p22973
aS" The only other alternatives I can think of are using the tracks from the Wookiee Attack set or catterpilla tracks, both of which wouldn't look right"

p22975
aS" These use the new flick-fire missiles which don't fall out are an excellent idea"
p22976

p23025
aS' This will be my eighth review on the boards'
p23026
aS' Strangely enough, there was another set called the V-Wing Fighter that came out in 1997 for the Space theme'
p23027
aS' Note that I am missing several small pieces to this set, but they are mostly insignificant to the overall look'
p23028
aS' The Box This is the standard box type for all 2005-2006 Star Wars sets'
p23029
aS" I can't say that I like it as much as the 2007 or 2008 box types, but it'll do"
p23030
aS' It features a profile view of Darth Vader and silver text'
p23031
aS' Overview This is the whole set'
p23032
aS' This ship is meant to protect the Chancellor at all costs'
p23033
aS' They are usually found in groups of three or four'
p23034
aS" Front This ship is very sleek, and you'll notice that it's colors are dark red, light bley, and dark bley with a touch of black"
p23035
aS' It starts at the nose very narrow, but as the body progresses to the back, it gets wider, like a "V" (hence the name)'
p23036
aS' Back Here is a view of the rear'
p23037
aS' Note the trans-neon green discs used to represent the boosters'
p23038
aS' Also notice the dark red R4 astro droid and the hinges used as aromor'
p23039
aS' Flight All four wings (two on each side) can open up for flight/ attack mode'
p23040
aS" They can open even farther then the pic shows, but it's not an intended function"
p23041
aS" The wings a great, but it's a real pain to position them correctly, and the bottom wings close when you set the ship down"
p23042
aS' Tail fins This is what the tail fins look like on each side, with two flaps attached to the top and bottom'
p23043
aS' If you look closely, the tail fins and wings look a little bit like a mini ship themselves, maybe controlled by remote'
p23044
aS' No, this is not an intended function, either'
p23045
aS' Guns, side The guns are very simple but very clever, using a double Technic hole piece, two black bars, and two Technic pins'
p23046
aS' Also note the landing gear'
p23047
aS' Minifig Finally, here is the minifig: a clone pilot'
p23048
aS' It has light blue arms and legs, white hands, a helmet with black markings and Republic insignia on it, and a double-sided torso'
p23049
aS' The front of the torso is great, featuring shoulder straps, armor plating, and a life support system'
p23050
aS' While this minifig is not altogether accurate to the movie, it has still been one of my favorite Star Wars figs'
p23051
aS' Back The back of the fig that can double as the front of clone marines'
p23052
aS' This side features shoulder straps and armor plating'
p23053
aS' Cockpit Lastly, here is the pilot seated in the cockpit'
p23054
aS' He fits perfectly, although it is not air-tight'
p23055
aS" We wouldn't want the poor guy to suffocate, now would we? That wraps up the review, here is the FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, a nice, easy, build, and the last of the small SW ships ($10 or less)"
p23056
aS" Playability: 6/10, pretty fun to swoosh around, but that's about it"
p23057
aS" Could use a vulture droid, but that would take away the 'small' factor"
p23058
aS' Swooshability: 10/10, very fun and easy to swoosh around endlessly, without fear of it breaking'
p23059
aS' Minifigs: 9/10, there really is no need to have more, although a Palpy fig would be outstanding'
p23060
aS' The pilot is a great figure though'
p23061
aS' Design: 9/10, extremely accurate to the movie, but the cockpit is not airtight'
p23062
aS" Price: 10/10, you couldn't ask for a better deal! Overall Score: 8"
p23063
aS'6, an excellent set'
p23064
aS' Unfortunately, this is the last of the small SW ships currently'

The Box As you can see, the front of the box illustrates the set very nicely, showing the skeleton warrior attacking and the knights firing their crossbow"
p23252
aS' The Back The Back of the box shows a small battle happening between a knight and a skeleton, as well as the main feature of the set, the firing crossbow (more on that later'

p23254
aS' The Back of The Instructions This merely shows pictures of other sets in the castle line'
p23255
aS' Random Instruction page This set does not use piece callouts to tell you what parts you will need in each step'
p23256
aS' However, the set is so small you should never have trouble finding a piece'
p23257
aS' The Minifigures This is the main reason I bought this set'
p23258
aS' You get two knights, one with a standard helmet, and the other one with a new mold'
p23259
aS' You also get a skeleton warrior'
p23260
aS' The Horse The set comes with a skeleton horse that looks great'
p23261
aS' However, it is a single molded piece that has no articulation'

p23268
aS' The Crossbow Wagon and now, to the main part of the set, the crossbow wagon'
p23269
aS' It is really just a plate with some whells attached and a lot of those cheese wedge pieces to create the track for the projectile'
p23270
aS' Back View This view shows the mechanism that makes the crossbow fire'
p23271
aS' It is powered by a rubber band'
p23272
aS' You pull back on a technic piece, which creates tension in the elastic band'
p23273
aS' When you let go, the elastic pushes the piece forward, which in turn hits the projectile and makes it fire! It works fairly well, but I would have prefered it fired farther'
p23274
aS' Entire Set The Skeleton charges at his adversaries! The knights prepare to counterattack! Overall Build: 10/10 The build is simple, easy and quick'
p23275

p23279
aS' Overall Score:43/50 Conclusion Overall, this is a great set and a solid army builder'
p23280
aS' You get three minifigures for a fair price and the crossbow wagon adds some much-needed playability'
p23281
aS' I bought two of these to bolster my army and to stock up on those rare domed helmet pieces'
p23282
aS' Basically, get this set! Thank you for taking the time to read my review'
p23283
aS' I hope you liked it!'
p23284
aS'I agree that this set is worth the price considering the amount of minifigs and even a skeletal horse'
p23285
aS' It also comes with a lot of blue 1x1 slopes that are always useful and quite rare to obtain'
p23286
aS' Another weapon for the soldier operating the catapult (or a shield for the other soldier) would have been great, but that is pushing it'
p23287
aS' The crossbow itself is quite nice and is better than what most $6 sets come with, IMO'
p23288
aS' Overall, a good set indeed'
p23289
aS' Thank you for the review and the other review concerning The Knight, of which I hope to buy in the near future as it looks like it comes with a great deal of goodies'
p23290
aS' The weapon rack is useful, too'
p23291
aS'Thanks for the input!'
p23292
aS'I like this set mostly because it has some very usable pieces, but also because of the amount of minifigures in the set, which is a whopping three and one large animal (skeleton horse)'
p23293
aS" The one thing, however, that I don't like about it, is that one of the catapult operators isn't armed"
p23294
aS' In my opinion, this would have been a good time for TLG to release a suitable dagger piece (not the kitchen knife) for its Castle line'
p23295
aS' Great review, by the way, it captured the key elements of this fantastic small set'
p23296
aS'Nice review, to start off'
p23297
aS' You got all the details someone could possibly need, in my opinion at least'
p23298
aS" I do enjoy this set as well, and I've bought only one to keep my minifigs as unique as possible"
p23299
aS' Despite my personal preference, I still find this a nice army builder'
p23300
aS' Good amount of minifigs for the price, as mentioned earlier, with each being different from the other'
p23301
aS" Though I would like the catapult manager to be armed with at least something, I still feel that he can just flee if he's ever in trouble"
p23302
aS" He's a good guy to use for the Castle gimmics if you have it"
p23303
aS' One more small comment'
p23304
aS" I also love those domed helmets, even if they aren't actually new"
p23305
aS' My favorite of them all, being followed up by the racer helmet'
p23306
aS'Nice review '
p23307
aS' I still thing sets like this are the reason castle has done so well, it allows you to collect a large number of minfig for not very much cash, which I certainly indulged in'

p23340
aS' The main event, the prison carriage! The design of this is excellent'
p23341
aS' With the bionicle piece and the white horns, it looks very spooky'
p23342
aS' The Tower This part is one of my favorites'
p23343
aS' It uses white horns to give it a great creepy look'
p23344
aS' One problem is that there is barely enough room for the 2 skeletons'
p23345
aS' The Driver Here you can see the driver and his whip'
p23346
aS' You can also see the bionicle spine'
p23347
aS' A side view When you look from the side, you can see the great design of the prison'
p23348

p23356
aS' A huge amout of minifigs, combined with a great design and good playabilty makes the set a winner'
p23357
aS' I would certainly recommend this set to anyone that remotely likes LEGO sets'
p23358
aS' Thanks, and happy building!'
p23359
aS'Nice review, it seems that you really covered all aspects of this FANTASTIC set'
p23360
aS' My favorite part about it is probably the fact that you can give almost every included minifig a mount, except for one poor knight '
p23361
aS' However, another part I like is that the horse includes a plain saddle, which is a nice relief after the overabundance of the gold-plate barding, which is nice, but overused in the early sets'
p23362
aS' Also, the SW jokes are hilarious! I particularly the running gag with the walker, but I like this one too'
p23363
aS' Reason for Edit: I made a mistake due to a loss of internet and an accidental post'

aS' Edited by Francis Marion, 03 September 2008 - 03:32 AM'
p23365
aS"You're really rolling these reviews out, huh? I am not sure how I feel about this set"
p23366
aS" While it does include five figs, three are skeletons and are generally worth much less than say three trolls/orcs (I know they didn't exist at this point in time so this is understandable)"
p23367
aS" The amount of horses is nice, but I'm not a big LEGO horse fan"
p23368
aS' What this set does have is a great appearance and brings atmosphere to the table'
p23369
aS' $20 is an affordable amount for those of us who do not wish to splurge too much on a toy while being enough to actually get a large enough set to create something out of'
p23370
aS" Personally, I'd rate it in between average and above average"
p23371
aS" Like another Castle set (I can't remember which), I just feel this one also lacks something"
p23372
aS"I really like this set, and it's probably my next purchase from a store (if I can still find it)"
p23373
aS" There's alot of great pieces (I especially like the spiked thingy on the front), and it makes a great addition for any skeletal army"
p23374
aS' Above all, I just love the spine-chilling feeling of it'
p23375
aS" If I were a minifig in a Legoland, I'd be scared out of my pants-piece if I saw a carriage like that rolling towards me in a dark night"
p23376
aS'Well, indeed looks like a very nice set'
p23377
aS' Especially the scared knights are very nice ;)'
p23378
aS'one of the best sets from the new castle theme'
p23379
aS' we havent seen a carriage in a long long time'
p23380
aS' and it looks so spooky and sceary! lots of minifigs new skeleton horses (3!) this was the first set i got from the new castle theme!! outstanding!'
p23381
aS'Thats a nice review, though I do feel the price was a little high but as you said you get so much in it'
p23382
aS' Last year Argos in the UK reduced it to 7'
p23383
aS'99, which was a true bargain and sent me all over London looking for a store with more in stock'
p23384
aS' Again as with all the Lego castle sets I think what makes it work so well is that Lego are now providing a much larger number of minfigs and thats often what makes a set'
p23385
aS'This was one of the first sets I bought from the new Castle theme and I love it'
p23386
aS' So many figs and awesome skeleton horses in just one set'
p23387
aS' At the same time you get quite a few usefull black bricks for castle MOCs'
p23388

aS'I bought this set to have the scared minifig, but I found a lot of cool pieces and stuffs'
p23391
aS' I love this set ^^'
p23392
aS"That's a super review Erdbeereis1, as usual and as we can expect from one of the Academy teachers"
p23393
aS' I gave the set a 4 (above average) because I think there are quite some minifigs included for its price (which is, I think, not that expensive at all) I also like the parts that are included, like the sceleton horses and weapons, wheels,'
p23394
aS' IMHO this set is a great armybuilder ! BTW: In Belgium I have seen this set being sold for 15,99 Euros'
p23395
aS'What an amazing review! I actually have this set and I decided to take it apart'
p23396

p23402

p23415

p23416
aS"I'm a little late in the coming (okay, a lot ), but regardless, I'd applaud you for another fantastic and insightful review, Erdbeereis"
p23417
aS' Out of all the castle sets, this one remains one of my favorites'
p23418
aS" I got it for Christmas in 2007, before I intended to spend much money on the new Castle theme (that changed once I managed to get the King's Castle Siege for a very good price)"
p23419
aS" It's really a wonderful set all around - the design accomplishes the spooky undead feel very well, and it contains a good piece selection and a phenomenal amount of minifigs"
p23420
aS" Seriously, this set is almost unrivaled in modern lego in the final area - I'm still amazed at how many minifigures TLC put in the kit"
p23421
aS" I also appreciate that the carriage has a far more realistic horse arangement - after all the sillyness of the one-horse pulled siege engines in KK, it's good to finally see a carriage pulled by multiple horses again"
p23422
aS' All in all, an excellent set, and well worth $20 IMO'
p23423
aS'Great review! This is my 2nd favorite lego castle set (tied with Skeleton Tower) that I own'

aS"7040 Dwarves' Mine Defender Theme: Castle Released: 2008 Price: 10 USD Pieces: 73 (3 minifigures) Introduction: Here I am, with one of the newest Castle sets realeased in early 2008"
p23466
aS" It's a small battle wagon with blades on the front, probably to demolish rocks in mines"
p23467
aS' But in this case, our hero dwarf has to use his machine against the evil trolls who want to destroy his happy kingdom'
p23468
aS' There is only one small booklet for instructions, no alternate model: Parts come in two bags, one for small pieces and one for bigger ones: Apart from the lovely figures, the brown parts will be quite useful for any castle builder'
p23469
aS" Extra parts are not even worth mentioning, there are no stickers: Figures are detailed enough, dwarf is lovely with his beard but his legs won't move because he is short: Figures are the main attraction for adult players"
p23470
aS" We haven't seen castle army builder sets for a long while and this is closest we've got in recent years"
p23471
aS" The dwarf is a little taller than it should have been but it's not possible to do so without creating a completely new mould for figures and that would be expensive"
p23472
aS' Its beard is oversized as well but that gives him a Legoish look which I like a lot'
p23473
aS" The trolls - that's what everybody calls them but I say they are orcs - are obviously evil but they are friendly enough not to scare our munchkins"
p23474
aS' But I wish they had different torsos or at least different faces like crownies'
p23475
aS' There are not enough weapons to arm everyone but the flag pole is really nice: Unlike the Star Wars army builders, this set has very little weaponry'
p23476
aS" Only one sword and one pike creates scarcity for 3 figures - Star Wars sets had 4 figures for same price! So I hope our middle age warriors don't come across any stormtroopers :) Building in progress: When you pull the chain the catapult fires a round brick: The set has quite good playability, moving blades and firing catapult should be fun for little children"
p23477
aS" I wouldn't expect more functions for such a small sized model, it hardly covers my hand"
p23478
aS" The blades move with the front wheel on the right: There is only one little downside, there is too much friction for the wheel and blades won't move synchronized"
p23479
aS' You may come over this problem by adjusting the blade height and lining them with the wheels'
p23480
aS" Mow the little buggers! You can adjust the blade height: There isn't enough room for the dwarf: Folder when public: http://www"

p23509
aS"long sentence) Oh yeah and I'll rate this as above average"
p23510
aS' I think it needs at least one minifig more than there is'
p23511
aS'A great review of a very good set, I must echo KimT though (I seem to be doing it an awful lot) it would be improved by the addition of one more fig to the set, as its the same price band as last years catapult'

p23513
aS" It's a great army builder, but so are many of the new castle sets"

aS'Nice review! I just recently purchased it for our future son and had to break into to it to get a first hand account of the merchandise! I am not that big into the castle theme'

aS'INDEXED Going through the boards I was amazed to find out that no one ever attempted to review one of the best Lego classics, the 6399 Airport Shuttle'
p23520
aS' While I was studying for exams a few weeks back I decided to take a break, built the monorail and take some pictures of it'
p23521
aS' Resulting in the present review'
p23522
aS' Along with this I made my first ever poll'
p23523
aS" Here we go: First, some data: Setnumber: 6399 Setname: Airport Shuttle Released in: 1990 in Holland, though Bricklink says 1991 Number of parts: 731 Number of figs: 9 Price: unknown, prices on Bricklink vary from $261 up to $2300 (!) but this was an expensive set even in the nineties The box: Mine is a bit battered by the owner before me, but there's still plenty to see"
p23524
aS' This is one of the largest boxes I have (look at the minifig in the down-right corner for the comparision) and it is a really neat storing facility for many sets'
p23525
aS' The box shows the set, and in the background the silhouet of the set that is to accompany this one: the airport from 1990'
p23526
aS' I like the angle of the box, showing the two stations, track and train in one picture'
p23527
aS" The back of the box shows some really nice ideas for other setups, why oh why has Lego abandonned this kind of showing what's possible with one set"
p23528
aS'? Inside flap of the box, showing details of the set and the functions, Detail on the front of the box, displaying the dimensions, it really is a huge track layout for one set! The instructions: there is a nice little booklet showing the same picture as the box art with the figures lined up underneath'
p23529
aS' The last page nicely folds out to show the entire setup of the tracks, The figures: A brilliant selection of minifigs including airport people and a cook'
p23530
aS' All figures that are supposed to go on the shuttle carry a ticket and there are also some suitcases (tickets fit inside, of course) Station # 1: The set includes two stations'
p23531
aS' Here is the first, depicting the airport'
p23532
aS' There are lots of details: a phonebooth, two seats, some flowers, a map, luggagelockers and of course the streetlights'
p23533
aS' A detailed shot of the station showing the luggagelockers and ticket-validating machine, Part of the beauty of this set is the fact that it is so extremely detailed, just look at the signs to show where to go next (stickers), and the scenery opposite the street'
p23534
aS' The station has the same shape as the Airport Shuttle logo, how sweet is that? The station pictured as part of the layout'
p23535
aS' The stations ends are made with airplane wings to smoothen the arrival of the shuttle'
p23536
aS' Station # 2: Here is the second station, my personal favorite: An elevated stop with a little snackbar underneath and stairs leading to the platform'
p23537
aS' Some chairs and streetlights here as well plus two old fashioned trees, The part of the set that can be used in any layout: the snackbar with hamburger sign (sticker)'
p23538
aS' Yes, those hamburgers look tasty indeed! Also notice the lights hanging from the platform overhead and the ticket-validating machine at the bottom of the stairs'
p23539
aS' Here we have the platform with information panels and seats'
p23540
aS' Also notice the two trafficlights for the train'
p23541
aS" Here's how it works: the train will travel in the direction the arrow is pointing"
p23542
aS" When turning the knob the two grey blocks will move towards or away from the track-center, activating a button on the centerpiece of the train (the motor) which makes the train start it's journey around the track"
p23543
aS' There is only one speed and the train can only be put to a stop or change direction at stations'
p23544
aS' The station as part of the layout'
p23545
aS' The Shuttle: Now on with the train: There are two carrriages connected to a centered motor'
p23546
aS' the power is provided by means of a batterybox containing a 9v battery'
p23547
aS' The batterybox is in one of the carriages and displays: Airport Shuttle'
p23548
aS' A total of five passengers can be seated inside leaving room for their luggage and two drivers'
p23549
aS' The front carriage with the button for the batterybox showing'
p23550
aS' The underside showing the gearwheel (metal) that brings the power from the motor onto the geared track'
p23551
aS' The black pointy things alongside the gear-wheel react with the direction knobs at stations'
p23552
aS' This is how the shuttle negociates with height differences, everything hinges and rotates, making the shuttle capable of performing steep climbs'
p23553
aS' The motor is powerful enough to not slow down at such a climb! Detailed shot, showing the first set of covered wheels in hinged position'
p23554
aS' The shuttle on the layout'
p23555
aS' The full layout: This layout is quite huge, involving lots of track pieces, ramps, ten large stanchion-poles and the two stations'
p23556
aS' To show the movement of the shuttle I have made a 20 second movie, which can be seen in My Brickshelf gallery of this set'
p23557
aS' Conclusion: Well, to conclude the review, some final thoughts: This truly is one of the more detailed sets around (at least from the nineties) and one of the largest in dimensions'
p23558
aS' The monorail system is cleverly thought out and works excellent'
p23559
aS' Track extensions are hard to get however and very expensive nowdays (especially the switchpoints and long straight track pieces)'
p23560
aS' The tracks included with this set will provide you with hours of fun though, because there are a lot of them'
p23561
aS' It can be quite hard to incorporate the monorail in your town without having a clearly-based-on-the-monorail-alone town'
p23562
aS' I tried to incorporate it some years ago (link here), posing a real challenge'
p23563
aS' The Ratings: Price: 8/10: this is an expensive set, if you can get it for under $200 get it!), this set is rare in any condition'
p23564
aS' Parts: 10/10: lots of rare pieces, cool minifigs, 9v system, roadplates, lots of minifigseats en red trainwindows'
p23565
aS' Originality: 10/10: there are very few monorails released, this one being the only town set'
p23566
aS' Compatibility: 8/10: can be a bit hard to incorporate in a town, but hey: you got the monorail so no complaining here! Total: 36/40: I can only reccommend this set to anyone, It is my personal favorite set upto this present time! If there are any questions, ask them, all comments are welcome of course!'
p23567
aS'You chose the perfect set for your first poll, Simon! No question this set is one of the all-time-beauties'
p23568
aS' I rated outstanding of course'
p23569
aS' I never hat the chance to get a complete copy of this set, but I do own the engine and quite a bunch of monorail tracks'
p23570
aS' Your very detailed review made me think of getting the whole set some day'
p23571
aS' Thank you very much for this! I never realized there were so many details included to this set: The snackbar and the telephone cell and all the other nice things'
p23572
aS' Really strange for a nineties set which often lacked details'
p23573
aS' The only thing that comes to my mind right now is that the engine looks quite blocky'
p23574
aS' If the set was released today, TLC would use more of those parts which make a better design imo'
p23575
aS' And it would fit better to the curved walls of the stations as well'
p23576
aS' [wishful thinking]How much would I love to see the monorail system back again! [/wishful thinking] I had to lough when reading your comment on the minifig seats'
p23577
aS' Don?t you own many of those? I don?t know where to put mine'
p23578
aS"I got this set last month and I can definitely say that even if you think it is one of the best sets ever, you won't fully appreciate it until you build it yourself"
p23579
aS' The elevated city station is much more complex than it looks, and the whole set is extremely detailed'
p23580
aS" The good: - As stated in the review, there's a lot of track, roughly twice as much as the last monorail made, 6991"
p23581
aS" 5 long straights too! - the designers didn't need to put in the hamburger stand or the ticket readers, but they did and made it even better - Great figure selection; airport workers as well as civilians The bad (if you can call it that in such a great set): - Hard to incorporate into an existing town if using the default track layout"
p23582
aS' The center loop would be inaccessible to vehicles and the layout is very large'
p23583
aS' - The monorail needs nearly a full straight section on either side of the city station or it will impact the corner of the station and stall if a curve is too close'
p23584
aS" - As far as I know the only town set with road plates that doesn't have a wheeled vehicle"
p23585
aS' A car would have been nice, a bus would have been incredible'
p23586
aS' But these small things in no way diminish from the fact that this is one of the best sets ever'

aS" I traded him a Guarded Inn, a Black Falcon's Fortress, and a couple other small castle sets for it"
p23601
aS' No regrets on that trade'
p23602
aS' It is hard to incorporate a monorail into a town, especially if you have a bunch of trains too! I ended up making my entire monorail system elevated'
p23603
aS" There's just no easy way to make a monorail / road crossing"
p23604
aS' I also gave up on having it run in a loop'
p23605
aS' Instead, it runs back and forth between two endpoints'
p23606
aS'An excellent review of one of the jewels in the crown of the Lego town range, to answer one of your question I think the lack of people owning this set is one of the reasons that its yet to have a review'
p23607
aS' Personally Ive only seen this set in the flesh once in my life when I was a child just before it was withdrawn from sale'
p23608
aS' It is a lovely set, well made and well produced though I think there is a flaw and thats when the passages get of the other end of their train ride what picks them up, a bus set for the airport would have been a good addition'
p23609
aS' Apart from that I cant really fault it and that fact it comes with three female minifigs is just stellar'
p23610
aS' As for incorporation, keeping it elevated seems the most sensible suggestion'
p23611
aS' Ive always thought it I have it and wanted to integrate the set to a town to use it in the style of the DLR in London, but thats just a thought'
p23612
aS'Yes, this is one of the best town sets ever'
p23613
aS'Thanks for that splendid review, Simonwillems! I clicked on "outstanding," of course! I also like those little details, especially the ticket validating machines'
p23614
aS" You're very fortunate to own this wonderful set! I hope you have an airport to go with it"

p23631
aS' This set is a lot bigger than either of those though'
p23632
aS' I always liked the monorail system a bit better than the trains because you could easily incorporate height into the tracks and spread them out in all three dimensions'

p23634
aS" You're right; it was 1990"

aS' 4598 (Red Bracket 2 x 3 - 2 x 2), occurs only in this set and only one other set'
p23684
aS' This truck was introduced in the same year that LEGO came up with the garbage bins that of course also appear in this set'
p23685
aS' Have you ever wondered why most of the time the streets of LEGO City are so clean and neat? No litter, no garbage everywhere, no chewinggum on the streets'
p23686
aS' Even with so many different inhabitants, it seems to always stay that way'
p23687
aS' However, the older AFOLs amongst us, have experienced totally different situations: rubbish everywhere, smelly and dirty looking pavements, minifigs that were losing their standard grin'
p23688
aS' That is why LEGO came out with this magnificent truck back in 1987'
p23689
aS' Before that, people needed to put there garbage in bags or maybe barrels'
p23690
aS' From that year on, every miniman and miniwoman is happily using a trash bin'
p23691
aS' The minifig civil servants never seem to become tired and the Garbage truck comes every other day to collect the rubbish and keep the city clean'
p23692
aS" The secret behind the clean LEGO city and the always happy 'standard grin' of our minifolks are the anti-litter warriors that use their powerful machines and handy tools to just get the job done! So if you don't own a garbage truck, better try to get one, before your standard grins also fade and your streets become as dirty as Naples (where the garbage collectors recently had a strike for quite some time)"
p23693
aS' An overview of the set including instructions (actually one is included in the set)'
p23694
aS" Unfortunately I afraid we don't have any boxes of this set left"
p23695
aS' Another image of the LEGO items in the set'
p23696
aS' It shows the truck, two civil servants to perform the waste collection duties, two garbage bins and a broom and shovel'
p23697
aS' The two chaps that always seem to smile, even when the litter that they collect really stinks'
p23698
aS' The accessories that accompany the set'
p23699
aS' A broom and a shovel to help cleaning up in case a dustbin tips over'
p23700
aS' A very nice feature of the set is that the elevator at the back can be lifted in more or less the same way that real garbage trucks do'
p23701
aS" As you can see here, the dustbin is emptied through a red 'train window'"
p23702
aS" (It seems to be that the hinges of my version will need some 'revision'"
p23703
aS') Panels inside the back of the truck maximize waste capacity for this 4 stud wide truck'
p23704
aS' It is nice that the designers added this simple red round brick on a clip'
p23705
aS' Presumably it should depict cylinders to let the back compartment tip for emptying or otherwise it might be gastanks'
p23706
aS' Again the complete set'
p23707
aS' It is very complete set but some additions could make it even more playable: - garbage (e'
p23708
ag61
aS' a green flower bottom or some round plates 1 x 1) - a place for the second worker to position himself on, when the trucks needs to drive to the dumpsite or an other street and also vertical bars for that second worker to hold himself by'
p23709
aS' This is what the truck will look like when dumping the litter at the recycle plant or dump site, the whole back nicely tilts, so that all the litter will fall out of the truck'
p23710
aS' A view on the back of the truck'
p23711
aS' Quite a small but yet effective opening'
p23712
aS' The front of the truck'
p23713
aS' Only one seat for just the driver, but I personally prefer that to a 6 wide truck that fills the total width of the streets and has problems with corners'
p23714
aS' Of course set 7991 (The orange garbage truck of last year) is also nice, we also own some of those but we never put them in our LEGO Town since they take too much room and the color scheme of 6693 is also more preferable to us'
p23715
aS' The two panels with the printed recycling pattern are a bit worn so we might recreate the recycle logo and put it on a sticker some day'
p23716
aS" Playability: 8/10 (Like I mentioned it is too bad that the set doesn't have any litter [however LEGO also saw that and has put litter in the 6693 set]) Design: 9/10 (a really nice truck with two minifigs and very nice details) Price: -/10 (I was not able to get any price information, at bricklink one can still obtain a 2nd hand one for about 25$"
p23717
aS") Overall: 8/10 (a set that should be entitled a 'classic' in the same list as the pizza restaurants, the 7750 and the blacksmith shop) That was all the pictures I was allowed to take since it seems that those brave man still have quite some trash cans to empty"
p23718
aS' Thanks guys for doing the dirty work so our minifigs stay happy and our streets stay clean! Peeron Lugnet Brickset: Bricklink entries Additional notes on the review: My brother has always been keen on garbage trucks'
p23719
aS" However when he became aware of this truck it wasn't available in the stores anymore"
p23720
aS" Newer sets that had the 'recycling theme' we not that good"
p23721
aS" They didn't have the emptying mechanism"
p23722
aS' So after our dark ages, one of the first sets we bought, were some of those nice refuse collection trucks'
p23723
aS' Although the new orange truck has the desired mechanisms and thankfully is a decent garbage truck, we more like 4 wide trucks than 6 studs wide trucks, so for the years to come our LEGO town inhabitants will still be seeing this great truck to control their waste problems'
p23724
aS'It would be cool to see a review comparing this set with the newer orange garbage truck'
p23725
aS'Definitely the best garbage truck ever, the color scheme is great and the design is awesome'
p23726
aS' Outstanding, without a doubt'
p23727
aS' I must have it sometime'
p23728
aS"This truck is simply beautiful! It's on my brickset wanted list! I love the colour scheme"
p23729
aS' Red and yellow are the right choice for this vehicle! The back part of the truck can be opened, so it can discharge the rubbish like real garbage trucks'
p23730
aS" You've also mentioned that in your review, and I find it a wonderful detail! Thanks for the review, JopieK!"

p23732
aS' Well I might want to do that, but then in a different way as the railroad maintenance: I will then review the orange one and make comments on it compared to this one'
p23733
aS'Yeah its very nice along with all the older sets'
p23734
aS" I've got the Cement Mixer that was released around about the same time as this"
p23735
aS'Thanks for the review'
p23736
aS' Like many such town sets, I would characterise it as cute'
p23737
aS" Contrasting it to the new bin lorry, it's nice that this set has two minfigs (more realistic) and two bins"
p23738
aS' Those bins are a great addition to Lego, although wheelie bins would be nice now (need some kind of 2x2 container you can clip a plate onto as a hinging lid, and clip mini-wheels under the back two studs)'
p23739
aS' Having two minifigs is a superior point for this earlier Lego rendition of a bin lorry'
p23740
aS' In fact, even though our bins are now emptied by a private company rather than the local council (as was the case up till the mid 90s), and of course for the last two decades there have been wheelie-bins, bin lorries have three guys - the driver and two collectors'
p23741
aS" However, our bin collectors for sure don't use a broom or shovel! Indeed on occasion they've befouled the street themselves if something goes wrong with hoisting the bin on the mechanism! The shape of the lorry in the set is still quite accurate, pretty good for a four-wide vehicle (I must admit to preferring the newer vehicles)"
p23742
aS"Thanks so much for the great review, I love that truck! I hadn't realized there was a real 4-wide recycle truck out there"
p23743
aS' I must get it one day to replace this abomination currently doing garbage duty in my town: I think that truck has seven pieces total in it'
p23744
aS' I do like the blue color though '

aS' True, woold be good for the people that have few new City sets like me, and your review is good BTW! I own this set however, because it was really cool those days, nowadays all trucks nd cars can do neat things, but that wasnt so back then'
p23747
aS'Greetings! Just looking through the review index when I came across this one'
p23748
aS' I recently acquired this set through ebay which came with a practically perfect box and instructions'
p23749
aS' I would almost say that no one played with it much as all of the parts were brand new'
p23750
aS' Anyway, I just wanted to say that this is a great set that was worth the $14'
p23751
aS'99!'
p23752
aS"Great to find this review of a classic set and it's far better than any yuk set from 1997 OMG what were they thinking ! I prefer the six wide for trucks, but for the 80's it was perfect and even today still holds it's own !"
p23753
aS"Great review, and I love the soft yellow effect to the pics IMO, the most recent garbage truck should've used the same piece for lifting the cans into the big bin instead of the droid arms"

aS"99 EUR/ Theme: Star Wars: Episode VI Year Released: 2006 Brickset Folder Bricklink Catalog Welcome to my ninth review the boards, today's review is the long awaited TIE Interceptor"
p23759
aS" But does it live up to expectations? Well, let's find out"
p23760
aS' I believe this is the first and only time TLG made this set'
p23761
aS" So, let's begin the review"
p23762
aS" The box The box is standard for it's time, with silver font"
p23763
aS' The background on the front has some planets and the Death Star II, clarifying that this set is from episode VI'
p23764
aS' Overview This set comes with the Interceptor model and one fig'
p23765
aS' The Interceptor has a very sleek, futuristic design, with four wings and a ball-shaped cockpit'
p23766
aS' The TIE Interceptor is a stealthy, speedy vehicle in the Imperial fleet'
p23767
aS" It is used for scouting missions, and not meant for attacking due to it's weak structure and low arsenal"
p23768
aS' Front This version of the TIE group is very attractive and cool-looking'
p23769
aS' It has an aerodynamic shape, giving it looks and speed'
p23770
aS' While not accurate to the movie\'s grey and black colored TIEs, the blue in place of the grey is just fine, and does not alter the "coolness" of the design'
p23771
aS' Thankfully, there are no stickers in this set'
p23772
aS' Cockpit Here you can see the ball-shaped cockpit'
p23773
aS" Be very, very careful when opening it; it's very flimsy and breaks off almost every time"
p23774
aS' Fortunately, both the windshield and the dish on top are printed, and not stickers'
p23775
aS" Please don't mind the dust"
p23776
aS' Cockpit Interior This is the inside of the cockpit'
p23777
aS' It is very roomy, airtight, and one of the few cockpits in SW sets that are this good'
p23778
aS' It makes up for lack of detail by giving the pilot plenty of room, so you should have no trouble there'
p23779
aS' It is also very smooth in the back and where the windshield folds down'
p23780
aS' This is by far the best SW cockpit I have ever seen done by TLG, good job! The only bad thing is the two tan bricks that clash with the rest of the color'
p23781
aS' Wing attachment This is how the wings are attached to the cockpit on each side'
p23782
aS' Unfortunately, the design on this part is not so good, and sometimes the wings break off'
p23783
aS' Plus, this part is very blocky, and there is a big juniorized piece on the base of the wings'
p23784
aS' Wings Here is what each wing looks like'
p23785
aS' There are three parts on each wing: a middle and two fins'
p23786
aS' The wings are very aerodynamic, with a diamond-like design'
p23787
aS' Note the Imperial insignias and the blue tiles lining the wings'
p23788
aS" Wing attachments cont'd Here, again, you see how the middle wing part is attached to the base (juniorized piece), and the fins attached to the base by hinges"
p23789
aS' The hinges allow the fins to fold in and out a bit, but again, this is very fragile, and the fins often break off'
p23790
aS' Gun placements This is an example of four guns on the ship, one on the tip of each fin'
p23791
aS' The guns consist of a tile with a Tenic tunnel hole on the bottom attached to a Technic pin, which is attached to a black bar'
p23792
aS' A good design altogether'
p23793
aS' Back Here you see the rear of the cockpit'
p23794
aS' You can see why the opening mechanism is so flimsy: the whole top and front is connected to the body only by a weak hinge system, as seen in the picture'
p23795
aS' Also note the small, trans-blue dish and the four trans-red studs'
p23796
aS' Minifigure Finally, here is the single figure that comes in this set, a TIE Pilot'
p23797
aS' It is an all black figure, with a life support system decal on the front and a helmet with silver Imperial insignias'
p23798
aS' An overall good minifig, with a different helmet mold than the Stormtrooper or Shadowtrooper'
p23799
aS" Well, I suppose that's about all, let's get to the FINAL VERDICT: Build: 6/10, a little difficult due the flimsiness of the ship, but should only take the average builder no more than 30 minutes"
p23800
aS" Playability: 7/10, it's fun to fly around ( ), but has no real functions"
p23801
aS' Swooshability: 7/10, you can swoosh it around fairly well, just be careful not to accidentally break it'
p23802
aS' Minifigs: 8/10, a good fig, although having only one leaves something more to be desired'
p23803
aS' Design: 4/10, very, very flimsy with the wings, windshield, and fins, but good for display'
p23804
aS" Price: 7/10: I think it was actually 30 USD when I got it, but I'm not sure"
p23805
aS' Overall Score: 6'
p23806
aS'5, an average set'
p23807
aS' Very delicate, so much that you can hardly pick it up, but good for display'
p23808
aS' The minifig is okay, and having no stickers is good'
p23809
aS' I would recommend this to a hardcore OT fan'
p23810
aS" That wraps it all up, please vote your opinion on this set in the poll, and I'll see you next review! Edited by JimButcher, 15 September 2008 - 03:10 AM"

aS'Nice set, but nicer review! Looks like the set has quite some nice parts'
p23812
aS'A nice set, my brother used to have this'
p23813
aS" I wish the pilot's helmet had a little printing on it, looks messed up to me"
p23814
aS'The Interceptor is my favorite TIE ship so i wish i picked it up'
p23815

aS'50$ (which equals about EUR 19,26 and GBP 15,57) Introduction: One of the sets that especially my cousin likes is this one'
p23822
aS' One time at the Dutch LEGOWorld event we had three of those there with flashing lights and loud sirens trying to put out the fire that was caused by the crash of again some LEGO aircraft'
p23823
aS' We never had this set before our drak ages and the sets probably came from ebay or so'
p23824
aS' In my opinion the newest Airport rescue is nice too but in the conclusion I will make some additional remarks about that'
p23825
aS" Just imagine what it would be like for your LEGO town if the pilot of one of your smaller planes, just couldn't stop before the end of the runway"
p23826
aS' Here you see the disaster that happened some day in our town: Fortunately all passengers got out safely thanks to our brave fire fighters'
p23827
aS' This magnificent truck was used to help putting out the fierce fire caused by the aviation gas from the small plane'
p23828
aS' The set includes two firefighters in distinguishable airport uniforms'
p23829
aS' In order to be able to safe the passengers and go for a quick intervention, our brave firemen have an axe for each of them, airtanks and a portable fire extinguisher'
p23830
aS' Here you see the truck on the right side'
p23831
aS' The large spout on the roof really makes it a remarkable truck'
p23832
aS' As you can see, behind the red door, there is space for the airtank of our brave firemen, at the right there is also place for the small hand held extinguisher'
p23833
aS' The left side of the truck has a water hose instead'
p23834
aS' For a truck from 1991 there is quite some room inside'
p23835
aS' Actually both firemen fit inside'
p23836
aS' Unfortunately there is only one seat'
p23837
aS' At the back there are two clips for the axes'
p23838
aS' There you can also find the main switch for the light and sound system'
p23839
aS' As you can see, the red flashing lights, do their job quite well'
p23840
aS' The sirene is just behind the bar with the flashing lights'
p23841
aS' The main spout just seems to begin emitting water'
p23842
aS' The front of the truck'
p23843
aS' For some reason there are two hidden spouts there as well'
p23844
aS' What their purpose is seems unclear but they look nice'
p23845
aS' KimT suggests that it is for foaming the runway and that is a real option of course'
p23846
aS' This set can be found on: Peeron Lugnet Brickset Bricklink entries Playability: 8/10 (Very nice set, details that are movable and of course the light and sound) Design: 8/10 (nice sets with nice details, but could have even been better: seat for 2nd fireman missing, no oxigen masks and only one airtank) Price: 7/10 (For a light and sound set and two firefighters, the price is reasonable I would say'
p23847
aS') Overall: 8/10 (nice sets, some details could even be better, too bad that there is only a five to choose from a sticker when you have more than one truck) Last but not least an overview of the complete set including instructions'
p23848
aS' "Fire mastered" as the Dutch firefighters will say when they have completed their job'
p23849
aS' We have also bought the newer airport rescue truck (7891)'
p23850
aS' However we think this 6440 one is much better'
p23851
aS' The light and sound, all the nice features and the nice details are much better than the new truck'

aS"00 / GBP unknown / EUR 19,95 Aargh stupid tree! for more than fourty years this 'megabrick' has tormented our town! we need some help! Long before my dark ages LEGO released this relatively small set"
p23923
aS" since they didn't have a construction site like nowadays, they released these small road-works"
p23924
aS" I was only six years old and really into small sets since my ADHD didn't allow me to sit and build for long periods of time"
p23925
aS' So these smaller sets were ideal for me'
p23926
aS' The instruction booklet'
p23927
aS' The complete set'
p23928
aS' The set itself is not really a surprise to set up and play with'
p23929
aS" First you'll build the smaller parts of the set like the container and the small verhicle"
p23930
aS' No real surprises there, except for the smaller car that fits perfectly in the cargo container'
p23931
aS' Just pull off the seat and steering wheel, and the car just fits'
p23932
aS' The crane itself is just as easy to build as the smaller parts'
p23933
aS' just place bricks on top of eachother'
p23934
aS" Although you'll still have the wire to connect and pull through a diversity of bricks and plates"
p23935
aS' The carco container and small car'
p23936
aS' Being out of my dark ages really tunnelled my vision toward bigger sets and completing my town'
p23937
aS' This set really comes in handy if i need construction or traffic workers in my town, I can just MOC a few containers for tearing down trees, fixing traffic lights, and so on'
p23938
aS" Behold the mighty cargomaster crane! It's pretty easy to say that a set as simplistic as this one is not much fun to play with"
p23939
aS' However if you see the bigger potential in your town this one could be of great value to any city'
p23940
aS" Playability: 7/10 (with only one container it gets a bit boring) Design: 9/10 (it's small, and fits perfectly) Price: 7/10 (Average, but not really cheap"
p23941

aS'00 / GBP unknown / EUR unknown Bricklink search results Brickset Lugnet Introduction This week I got the flu'
p23948
aS' so since I have to stay home and get better, I might as well make a review'
p23949
aS" It's one of the most amazing older city sets, thus making it a really valuable review"
p23950
aS' This is the story about four handsome firemen living in one of the most amazing city structures out there'
p23951
aS' The 6389 Fire control center'
p23952
aS" The box I actually didn't remember the box to be that small"
p23953
aS" (Borrowed from Peeron) The four hunky firemen Oh jeah what women doesn't like a man in a uniform The manual Even the manual is aging"
p23954
aS" but then again it's 17 years old! Review As you all know a city must have some standard civil services, like a hospital and a police station"
p23955
aS' A fire house also is a must for any lego city'
p23956
aS' This particular fire house is one of the most amazing sets ever to be released'
p23957
aS" In this cool set you get 4 minifigs, all fire fighters, two verhicles, and a helicopter Firefighters have to move around The futuristic fire truck is definately my favourite! Chief's car The smallest verhicle of the set, it's a small all-terrain jeep for the fire chief"
p23958
aS' pretty much a standard car in those days'
p23959
aS' a real simple layout, and a trunk which holds a small fire hose'
p23960
aS" It's lucky to be in this set, because it complements the whole thing The car Luckily it's red and it has de cool signs on the side"
p23961
aS' Helicopter Another great addition to the whole set is the helicopter'
p23962
aS' Again in a basic setup for that kind of verhicle at the time'
p23963
aS' This one has the nice addition of two hoses to put out the fires raging in lego city'
p23964
aS" The chopper No, it doesn't really fly Really cool fire truck thingy This fire truck is definately the best of the verhicles in this set"
p23965
aS" It's actually a futuristic model of fire trucks"
p23966
aS" I haven't seen any other fire truck like this"
p23967
aS' I saw a police truck like it though'
p23968
aS" but we're talking fire fighters right? Actually the whole thing han open up to reveal a number of fire fighting appliances such as a hose, a computer, and a oxygen tank"
p23969
aS' The fire truck click for bigger version! The main building actually looks kinda empty when the trucks and chopper are gone'
p23970
aS' However, this still is realistic compared to a real fire house'
p23971
aS' Also the front has those amazing sliding doors, which make this thing really look cool and clean'
p23972
aS' Off to fight a fire Main structure, with the slinding doors pulled down Actually those sliding doors are also the hard part of the model'
p23973
aS' Since all the bricks must be perfectly aligned, or else the doors will stutter'
p23974
aS" But if you're a little familiar with lego then you don't need to worry"
p23975
aS" From the back Enough room to play with I'm going to give my perspectives on each of the sides On the left we have the garage for the bigger fire truck"
p23976
aS" The only real flaw about this set is that this garage isn't long enough for the fire truck"
p23977
aS' This could have been solved by making it two or three studs longer'
p23978
aS" Notice the cool sunroof! In the middle we have the chief's office"
p23979
aS' complete with coffee machine, a diversity of computers, and a tape recorder, most likely to tape any incoming calls'
p23980
aS' A lot of details are crammed up in there'
p23981
aS' just like in the rest of the set'
p23982
aS' To the right is the helicopter platform'
p23983
aS" I really like the grey-blue-yellow of the platform because it doesn't look so red anymore"
p23984
aS" Don't get me wrong, red is a cool color, but not too much red! And the helicopter actually fits, and stays in place during playtime"
p23985
aS' The baseplate filled up This picture says it all'
p23986
aS' Again the four lego hunks are greeting all the ladies The minifigs are from a classic series, this happens with more of my lego sets'
p23987
aS' Bottom line is that this set is one of the best fire houses lego created'
p23988
aS' Verdict The build is pretty easy but takes a while to really see where you are with your building'
p23989
aS" It's nice to have a hospital from the same era, this create a more uniform look to your city"
p23990
aS' once you completed the model your baseplate is pretty filled up but still has a lot of opportunities'
p23991
aS" Playability: 10/10 (cool trucks, a chopper, and sliding doors, nuff said!) Design: 9/10 (insanely good design) Price: 10/10 (couldn't get better than this) Overall: 9"
p23992
aS'6/10 with a score like that one can only say'
p23993
aS' get one'
p23994
aS' NOW! Time to go home The trucks and chopper back on their rightful spots'
p23995
aS'I have this one'
p23996
aS' The newer 6571 station is better in some ways, but I always liked the big airport-style fire engine in this and the windows covering the garages'
p23997
aS' One mod project I have in mind is to expand the base, adding a second room in the area beneath the control center'
p23998
aS' Interestingly, this set had two different box pictures'
p23999
aS' There was the original 1989 yellow Legoland box and a 1991 blue System box, and the blue box has the vehicles in different places'
p24000
aS' Quote Price: USD $85'
p24001
aS"00 / GBP unknown / EUR unknown If this is referring to the original price, it wasn't that much"
p24002
aS' $50 is more like it'
p24003
aS'This set looks real nice, but a Wall in the middle with a stair and a few desks/containers'
p24004
aS'I think the 6382 Fire Station is the better one from the 80ies'

p24006
aS" I agree, have that 6382 set for about 27 years now, but I have always like that one 'futuristic' truck when I was a child so I also still have some feelings for this set as well"
p24007
aS' @Crazydance: nice review after all!!!'
p24008
aS'Big Supie, on Sep 7 2008, 08:46 PM, said: I think the 6382 Fire Station is the better one from the 80ies'
p24009
aS' I have 6382 and agree that it is a great set'
p24010
aS" It doesn't have a chopper like this set and the fire engine is not as flash"
p24011
aS' It does have a downstairs in the building though (at least a door and a front wall anyway!)'
p24012
aS" It's nice to see a review of this set as it's one that I often looked at in the catalogue and thought of getting but never did"
p24013
aS" It's great to see the details that I otherwise would not have seen"
p24014
aS" I don't like the firemen with hair though! They should have helmets or caps IMHO! Thanks for the review! Cheers Rog"
p24015
aS'This looks like a great set, I like the futuristic fire truck'
p24016
aS" That might be what I do with my Imperial Shuttle's glass cockpit"
p24017
aS'From memory Argos sold it originally for about 21 GBP'
p24018
aS' I seem to remember this as I could not afford the airport released the same year as this was about 29'
p24019
aS'99! Seems such a small amount of money now, Now have 2 copies of this set, only 1 boxed :-)'
p24020
aS'Found this set on a flea Market in Munich, yesterday'
p24021
aS' Just 25 years after its release'
p24022
aS' The instructions for a total of five models, two of them printed, the other 3 are just photo instructions in the book'
p24023
aS' It still has the box in good shape, despite some wear from the age'
p24024
aS' Sadly five little pieces were missing, and 5 wrong pieces inside instead (2 complete wheels and a classic 80s-90s plane wing (dumped into my bricks)'
p24025
aS' But I was able to replace the missing Minifig torch and the 4 missing plates with identical pieces from my collection'
p24026
aS' The Box and Contents The set still has the original box'
p24027
aS' Inside the pieces, plastic insert, instructions and a 1987 Technic catalogue, imagine that set livespan today'
p24028
aS' Four years and the 8841 is still in the catalogue'
p24029
aS' Classic technic design from early 80s showing a function drawing of the Steering and the main model A small set, but with a flap shoeing the contents'
p24030
aS' All pieces in the inner box and the papers included'
p24031
aS' 5th Model: Soapbox Racer This is more or less a soapbox racer with working steering, but no engine'
p24032
aS" It's got a rather blocky design, but still looks sleek enough and is a simple build little over 100 pcs out of 180"
p24033
aS' The Soapbox at step 2 Just included the steering at step 6 Completed and ready to race downhill'
p24034
aS' Total: 7/10 Simple, but effective 4th Model: Simple Chassis very simple and boring alternate using just 1/3 of the 180 pieces in the set'
p24035
aS" It even hasn't got a seat construction"
p24036
aS" It's just a plain steering mechanism attached on wheels with a spartan chassis of just a few pieces"
p24037
aS" This is the whole model at step 5 Just attach the steering mechanism and wheels and you're done Total: The worst alternate model of the complete set"
p24038
aS' Just a boring 4/10 3rd Model: Balance Very original small model'
p24039
aS" It's a small model of a working classic Balance"
p24040
aS" And it works with small parts laid on the scales, altough they've got just a 4x4 Footprint"
p24041
aS" IT's a fast build"
p24042
aS" just 15 minutes and you've done it"
p24043
aS' The model as it looks at step 3 Finished'
p24044
aS' Easy build with just 63pcs out of 180 Total: Very original model, it actually works with small weights, but a very simple build'
p24045
aS' Still a 7/10 Alternate Model: Tractor with equipment This is the second model'
p24046
aS" It's a simple but boxy design featuring a harrow and a plough"
p24047
aS' The tractor has a similar design to the very first tractor set, but much smaller'
p24048
aS' The plough is about 24-wide and the harrow is completely SNOTTED even back in 1983'
p24049
aS' Has two functions: Working steering and the coupler for the equipment'
p24050
aS' Uses almost all pieces of the set'
p24051
aS" The tractor at step 8, the steering isn't completely attached now This is the completed tractor The complete harrow Finished alternate with the plough attached"
p24052
aS' Total: Nice, but quite ugly and boxy design for a tractor with 4 wheels of the same size'
p24053
aS' Takes me to a 6/10 Main Model: Desert Racer This is the main model, with a nice (for early 80s) but boxy design'
p24054
aS' It has two functions'
p24055
aS" Steering and a working 1-cylinder rear engine, which is of the old 2x2 piston type, since the small piston design wasn't invented back then"
p24056
aS' This is the only model of the set, which has piece callouts in the instructions'
p24057
aS" The printed alternate model has no callouts, they weren't invented on both models back in 1983"
p24058
aS' The three smaller photo instruction alternates have a piece callout at the beginning showing all needed pieces'
p24059
aS' The seat is a nice, but blocky design and use a primitive SNOT technique'
p24060
aS' This is the model at step five'
p24061
aS' The piston is already attached'
p24062
aS' Imagine this state on step 5 in modern sets'
p24063
aS' Back then LEGO had challenging instructions, not the step madness like today This is the engine just made of plates with a hole in the middle for the piston Step 9'
p24064
aS' The piston engine is completed'
p24065
aS' On step 12 the roll bar and the seat are installed'
p24066
aS" Only the steering isn't completed yet"
p24067
aS' Front view of the finished model'
p24068
aS' Just 15 steps needed back then'
p24069
aS" Bird's eye view of the whole set Displayed on the box Model Verdict: Nice design, especially the colorful seat in SNOT technique, but quite boxy especially the engine, since there were only the huge pistons"
p24070
aS' Still a 9/10 Set Verdict: Design and Models: 7/10, very boxy designs, due to the age'
p24071
aS' The chassis alternate sucks Build: 9/10 Classic 80s technic building'
p24072
aS' Quite challenging but fun Sturdyness: 7/10: rear section damaged after the table fall, but rather easily fixed Fun: 9/10 Blast from the past'

p24093
aS'00$ (which equals about EUR 50 and GBP 40) Introduction: Our most favorite theme is 12V trains'
p24094
aS' Actually I got my first 77-series back in 1981 (5th of December, I was 2,5 years old) just a week before my brother was born'
p24095
aS' Some years later I got the 7740'
p24096
aS' After our Dark ages we (my brother, cousin and myself) got all 12V trains at least once'
p24097
aS" This 7725 was gathering dust in my brothers' room"
p24098
aS' The train in all its splendor'
p24099
aS" As you can see it doesn't occur at the back of the 12V era train instructions although its larger brother the 7740 does"
p24100
aS" Some investigation learned that all the sets at the back of the instructions date from 1980 so the 7725 wasn't released yet"
p24101
aS' Here you can see the front of the 7725 with the driver in the cockpit'
p24102
aS' The driver is in fact the only minifig that was included in the set'
p24103
aS' As you can see, our version of the train has a different front than the one in the instructions'
p24104
aS' Apparently the former owner used 7861 (Lighting Set (12 V)) to upgrade the train with working back- and frontlights'
p24105
aS" I like the original lights but didn't notice that the train had those double lights until I did the review"
p24106
aS" Maybe we will give the train again it's original signs and put custom LEDs in it or so so that the train can drive into two directions with accurately working lights"
p24107
aS' Another thing about the lights that puzzle me are the Backlights'
p24108
aS" While typing this I realise that the former owner might have added those, so let's have a look at the instructions then"
p24109
aS' As it turns out, the lights are there also in the instructions'
p24110
aS" I recently learned that only the last car or coach of a train has it's red lights on"
p24111
aS' So unless the train drives with only the front car it will never use those red backlights'
p24112
aS' Here you can see the cockpit with the engineer'
p24113
aS" The cables don't look very pretty but well, the train at least has working light"
p24114
aS' Here you can take a look at the inside of the engine car'
p24115
aS" While the 7745 has a nice 'fake engine' there, just the weight bricks and the ugly cables, apart from the engineer and his cockpit, no other nice features here"
p24116
aS' B'
p24117

aS' LEGO always used tiles in such a trains to make it easier for kids to take off the roof and have access to the minifig passengers etc'
p24118
aS" Here the 'proof' that it is an electric train"
p24119
aS' The pantograph of the front car'
p24120
aS' It has the same kind of panthographs that the 7745 has'
p24121
aS' The middle car has 4 chairs'
p24122
aS' As you can see, some vandal must have nocked over this one'
p24123
aS' Hope they leave the cables alone'
p24124
aS' This early morning train seems to have one passenger: a workman'
p24125
aS' I like the small 2x3 windows from this car very much! They give this care a nice look'
p24126
aS' Also the door in the middle adds something special to the train'
p24127
aS' As far as I know, no other passenger train has the doors in the middle'
p24128
aS' Here you see the side of the train, just after the train has left Brickingham Station where the worker, probably from set 6647 (Highway Repair) that was also released in 1980'
p24129
aS" A closeup of the last car with steering stand to allow the train to travel back and forth without having to 'make head', in other words: putting the engine in front again"
p24130
aS' The train, shunted to an end track so it can be cleaned (I think it is apparent that it definitely needs cleaning very badly)'
p24131
aS' This set can be found on: Peeron Lugnet Brickset Bricklink entries Playability: 5/10 (The train is fine, but with only one minifig not very playable without other sets; also no accessories at all!) Design: 7/10 (Nice train, the inside could have been a lot better, but I really like to original front lights!) Price: 7/10 (the train came with motor so not a bad price, goes now for quite some money at eBay'

p24133
aS"5/10 (nice set but the 7745 is a better train I'm sure) Well that was it for today"
p24134
aS' I hope you have enjoyed this review and got tears in your eyes seeing how nice the 12V era was'
p24135
aS' It never comes back, but maybe LEGO rereleases some of this sets in the 2009+ train era (very likely that this is just wishful thinking)'

aS'A very nice review, JopieK! You know, I was wondering how LEGO could justify having two 12V-powered passenger trains at the same time, but after reading the review, and seeing the lack of figures and accessories, I guess I understand why (plus the train is rather compact)'
p24138
aS" Oh, and I can't help but think that the chairs in the middle carriage are somewhat oddly placed, because those placed next to the door are unusable because the door takes up room needed for figs' arms"

p24181
aS'The best 12v legotrain is for me the 7740'
p24182
aS' The 7725 is still a goodlooking train and the only one with short wagons in a electric version'
p24183
aS' Before I started to with bricklink, I started to build this train in blue'
p24184
aS" I've build 4 trains of it and sold 2 of them"

aS'Beach Cruisers Set #: 6445 Theme: Island Xtreme Stunts Year Released: 2002 Piece Count: 97 Minifigs: 2 List Price: $7 (USD) During a trip to Legoland California in 2002, their Big Store had a neat little display of some new sets and themes including Island Xtreme Stunts'
p24195
aS' The new theme offered great colors including orange, tan, and light blue; which immediately caught my eye'
p24196
aS' The theme focussed on island fun with some adventure, and included some great figs like the Brickster'
p24197
aS' I had to buy at least one set choosing Truck & Stunts Trike (review coming soon) at the time'
p24198
aS' The theme was short lived and many of the sets were on sale at discount toy stores not too long after their initial release'
p24199
aS' I picked up this set, 6445 Beach Cruisers for $3'
p24200
aS'33 (USD), which will be my first of three Island Xtreme Stunt reviews'
p24201
aS' Starting with the box, a race between the Street Surfer and Skate Boarder: The back shows some alternate models including a sail boat and jet ski: Same image on the instructions as the box: But the backside shows the Island Xtreme Stunts video game for different platforms: The set includes a small decal sheet for the skateboard: I love the two figs included within this set'
p24202
aS' One is a "hippie-type" with shades and leafed muscle short, and the other "Pizza Boy" skateboarder'
p24203
aS' Check out the "Pizza Boy" on his skateboard: Two green brackets are included for attaching each fig to the long grey bar'
p24204
aS' Using this piece, one can make the skateboarder do tricks and flips'
p24205
aS' The "street surfer" vehicle is pretty nice to: The sail is placed on a black bar and lance, then attached to the vehicle: Here\'s a picture of the vehicle'
p24206
aS' To me, it has that old "soap box derby" look to it - like something kids would create to race down a hill: The vehicle doesn\'t have a steering wheel, but rather two levers which I think work well in the cockpit: Here\'s the underside: The set has three neon orange wheels that attach to technic axle pins to attach to the vehicle: Lastly, the entire set with a few extra pieces: Final Thoughts While Island Xtreme Stunts is not the best City/Town sub-theme, esp'
p24207
aS' for the traditional Lego Classic Town fan, it does have some fun sets like this little beach cruiser'
p24208
aS' Good figs, a skateboard, and a very "rollable" (fun word equivalent to "swooshable" but for vehicles with wheels), vehicle'
p24209
aS' You can even blow on the sail to get it to roll across the floor'
p24210
aS' This set is a lot of FUN!'
p24211
aS"Great review! I would buy the sets, but sadly TLC doesn't sell them anymore"
p24212
aS" I have one question only: How can you be reviewing at this time at night!?! I would never dream of doing that! Well I can't wait to see the other reviews!"

aS' I did this review a few weeks ago and just now posted it'
p24215
aS' Remember also that we are on different time zones'
p24216
aS'I had never seen these sets before in my retail stores before'
p24217
aS' However, I do remember the existence of its video games'
p24218
aS' Look like an interesting set for great outdoor enterainment and fun for LEGO citizens whom is out for real thrill and excitement'
p24219
aS' This theme never really got me excited back then'
p24220
aS" After reading your review, it's quite useful for some new addition to your town features, such as including a skater boy, holding the pizza instead of using the pizza van"
p24221
aS' The high fuel cost must have caught up to them, to resort using skate board for delivery'
p24222
aS" As for the street surfer vehicle, it's a cool looking vehicle with unique construction"
p24223
aS' Pardon me, I have not seen such design before'
p24224
aS" I will actually tear off the wheels, cover up the sides and used it for wind surfing! That's the whole idea"
p24225
aS' After giving some thoughts and weighs its factors, I will have to give it a "3" for this set'
p24226
aS' I will probably get it if its on sales'
p24227
aS' Once again, Brickster this is a lovely review which has showed us a new perspective of Island Xtreme Stunts'
p24228
aS'Like WhiteFang I too only remember this line in computer game form'
p24229
aS' I used to love that game! I actually have never seen a review for an xtreme stunts set, so this was nice to see'
p24230
aS' As for the set, I think it looks pretty good'
p24231
aS' I really like the hippie guy'
p24232
aS' The windboard thing is nice as well, but looks a bit strange somehow'
p24233
aS' I give this set a solid 3 out of 5'
p24234

p24235
aS'Nice review'
p24236
aS' I got this set not long after my ending of the dark ages'
p24237
aS' It was even then already on slae for just 5 euro'
p24238
aS' I like the figs and the vehicles'
p24239
aS' It were some of my first orange pieces'
p24240
aS' The Hippie Guy is called " Snap Lockit" and the Pizza Guy is called " Pepper Roni"'
p24241
aS' I think the legodesigners had a cosy evening with much beer when they thought about the names'
p24242
aS' I think this line was the only line which was made first as computergame and after that as a real line instead of the other computergames based on already existing lines'

aS' Thanks for that bit of info'
p24246
aS" I'm not familiar with the computer game or the characters, although I may have heard the name Pepper Roni"
p24247
aS" Do you know the Island Girl's name (not included in this set though)?"
p24248
aS'Her name was Sky Lane'
p24249
aS' It\'s quite sad, though, to actually play the game--the "Xtreme Tower" is the only set that made it into the game itself, and it was a really watered down version of the Information Center from the first two games'
p24250
aS' But the island was, in the game, filled with incredible buildings that would have made really cool sets'
p24251
aS"Air Chase Woosh! The Brickster's seaplane flies over the beach quickly"
p24252
aS' Hippie Dude is in close pursuit on his hang glider'
p24253

p24254
aS' Can Hippie Dude catch him before he either gets away or crash lands in the water'
p24255
aS' You decide, with Island Xtreme Stunts Air Chase'
p24256
aS' Set #: 6735 Theme: Island Xtreme Stunts Year Released: 2002 Piece Count: 83 Minifigs: 2 List Price: $10 (USD) A nice addition to the Island Xtreme Stunts theme, Air Chase includes two air vehicles; a seaplane and hang glider'
p24257
aS' The set has nice Island colors inclusing white, light blue, and orange'
p24258
aS" Also includes in the set are some great chrome pieces for the Brickster's airplane wings"
p24259
aS' Starting with the box'
p24260
aS" You can see Hippie Dude in close pursuit: The back of the box depicts some nice alternate jet skis: Same front box picture on the instructions: And on the backside, pictures of the video game: Air Chase includes two nicely detailed figs, Hippie Dude (for lack of his official name), and the Brickster: Here's a picture of the orange hang-glider: And the underside: Unfortunately, the hang-glider is too heavy to be held up by a minigig"
p24261
aS' While I like the brick-built glider for the extra pieces, the plastic wing pieces from the Ninja theme would have worked effectively and be a lot lighter'
p24262
aS" I think the seaplane is the best part of the set: Here's a shot of the front end"
p24263
aS' I like the skeletal shark/fish design'
p24264
aS" What's great is none of the pieces use stickers"
p24265
aS' They are all printed: Including the tail end: Although the cockpit has no steering wheel or lever piece, it does have a very nice printed 1x2 tile: The wings of the airplane have hinges to allow them to fold inward slightly: Also notice the nice chrome/silver pieces'
p24266
aS' Here\'s a shot of the underside of the seaplane: And lastly, the complete set: Final Thoughts: Air Chase is another one of those "fun" Island sets'
p24267
aS' Two figs with two vehicles make a perfect combination for creating some dog-fights in the air'
p24268
aS" At the same time, the Brickster's plane can land in the water to explore other adventure play opportunities"
p24269
aS' This set is also a nice addition to the Island Xtreme Stunts Truck & Stunt Trikes (6739)'
p24270
aS' The seaplane can be hauled by the large semi-truck included within 6739'
p24271
aS' Hope you enjoy this review'

aS' Is that one minifig breaking out of prison? (Just wondering about his clothing'

aS"It is not very often that I rate a Legoset 'poor' (it's the first time actually), but in this case I had no other option"
p24299
aS" The idea of this set is good, and I like the mostly yellow minifig, but the design of both the airplane (weird 'window'-piece, a propellor that is way too small, minimal skies underneath and a strange colourscheme) and the hangglider (two handlebars on the wings, too many colours) makes the set mark the essence of LEGO's downfall during those years"
p24300
aS' I really appreciate the fact that you made a review of this set, Brickster, it made me look into the details of 6735, but I am just as sure today as I was back then: I will never buy this'
p24301
aS' Anyway, thanks for the review, the quality of the set may be a disapointment your review certainly is not'

aS'Hello all Eurobricks members and Town Lovers, Today, I will be doing up a review on Glade Runner set'
p24307
aS' This is a very small set which is slightly bigger than the current impulse set'
p24308
aS" It's part of the Race theme which involved in land and sea racers back in the early 1990s"
p24309
aS' I just love these orignal race themes which is produced back then'
p24310
aS' Name: Glade Runner Theme: LEGO System / Town / Race Year: 1993 Pieces: 29 Minifigs: 1 Price: USD$3'
p24311
aS'25 An image of a 6513, Glade Runner Swamp race shall begins This glade runner is pretty nice looking with its sleek sports look'
p24312
aS' Well, for a glade runner in the water, it certainly looks much impressive'
p24313
aS' Somehow, I felt that the 6513 is aligned with the 6514 Trail Ranger'
p24314
aS' I always had that perception that both vehicles are brothers and was released under the same year'
p24315
aS' In fact, Glade Runner was released in 1993 based on Peeron information'
p24316
aS' I always felt that this set is used for Investigators or Police to used for tracking or search purposes in the swamp areas instead of using it for a race'
p24317
aS" I will place this set in the jungle, somewhere like Brickster's jungle settings"
p24318
aS" Although it looks too bright for such serious agenda, but I think it's pretty useful to use it this way"
p24319
aS' They can rent it from the nearby shop and used it to search'
p24320
aS' It kind of reminded me of the movie, US Marshals which acted by Tommy Lee Jones and Wesley Snipes'
p24321
aS' Meet the ace Please pardon his trousers'

p24325
aS' This is my favourite design during that period'
p24326
aS' It comes with a yellow lifevest too'
p24327
aS" As for the 1x4 printed tile with 3 stars shining in front of the runner, it's a very nice printed tile that can be used for other racing purposes in other sets as well"
p24328
aS' Overall design The built is very simple and yet so realistic'
p24329
aS' Making use of the aeroplane tailhead to add as the holder for the rotor is smart'
p24330
aS' The white bricks acting as a platform for both sides to hold the driver to sit onto the centre with the steering wheel at the front'
p24331
aS' I am very happy with this design'
p24332
aS' Place the glade runner in front of the fan with a reasonable fan speed'
p24333
aS' You will see the rotor runs like a charm'
p24334
aS' Different angles of the vehicle Close encounter with the "Swamp Sharks" coined by Brickster! See you later To conclude, this is a very nice little set that can provide much fun'
p24335
aS" I don't really used it to race in the waters"
p24336
aS' Instead, I leave it to my imagination and used it for police investigation purposes such as air crash excerise, search and rescue operations and etc'
p24337
aS' I think it can provides quite a fun loving experience'
p24338
aS' Although, the set might not be very appealing to some people, but I find it very fun to play around and is one of my favourite sets in the 1990s where I placed it with my 6514 Trail Ranger together'

aS" And do you see what I see? Yes, that's right, the DSS is in a bag so it doesn't get bent! Why TLG doesn't do this more often is beyond me"
p24380
aS' Bag #1 The set comes with a very nice selection of pieces'
p24381
aS' A large number of these are orange'
p24382
aS' Manual Silly me, I forgot to take a picture of the front of the manual'
p24383
aS' The picture is the same as on the front of the box'
p24384
aS' The back shows some of the 2007 city sets in a nice little scene'
p24385
aS' And inside'
p24386
aS' Minifig Here is the friendly garbage/recycle man'
p24387
aS' He looks nice but with the same head as so many other city figs before him'
p24388
aS' Come on TLG! Give us some new heads! The Sticker Sheet The stickers actually are pretty decent as far as stickers go'
p24389
aS' I like the recycle sign'
p24390
aS' After Bag #1 This is where we stand after the first bag is built'
p24391
aS' Bag # 2 The parts contained in the second bag'
p24392

p24393
aS' Extra Parts Some nice 1x1 slopes and 1x1 round plates'
p24394
aS" Everything Built Now that everything is built, let's check it out! The design of the set is very nice and the color scheme looks great"
p24395
aS' When you see it, you immediately know what it is'
p24396
aS' The back has a droid arm that acts as a handle to dump the trash/recycling in the truck'
p24397
aS" It's simple, but works well"
p24398
aS' Here you can see the dumping mechanism'
p24399
aS" It works by a sliding technic beam with a stopper On top of the truck you can store the worker's cart"
p24400
aS' This works really well'
p24401
aS' I think though that the top of the truck overall looks a bit jumbled up with a few too many different colors'
p24402
aS' The bottom'
p24403
aS' Trash dumping time! This is a good feature of the set'
p24404
aS' A very well built SNOT front section'
p24405
aS' This looks fantastic with the grills and number plate sticker'
p24406
aS' Someone has left a big mess on the street'
p24407
aS' Brickshelf Folder Ratings! Price: 10/10 (For $15 this is a very good deal at 206 pieces) Parts: 9/10 (Lots of orange) Design 9/10 (A very well designed set'

p24409
aS' Summary This is a great small set for the price with fun features, nice colors and good design'
p24410
aS" I would certainly recommend this set, no matter what it's really called Thanks, and happy building!"
p24411
aS'This is one of those sets that make me really want to start building up a city'
p24412
aS" It's a great value, has a lot of useful pieces, and is just plain fun to play with"
p24413
aS' I do miss vehicles having doors though'
p24414
aS' Great review'
p24415
aS' I was a bit curious as to how the dumping mechanism worked'
p24416
aS' As well as the sticker count'
p24417
aS'Yeah, the name on this set is strange'
p24418
aS' I think all the boxes say Garbage Truck'
p24419
aS" I guess it's up to each builder to decide whether 1x1 round plates are recyclable material or not"
p24420
aS" It's a great model in any case"
p24421
aS" I love these highly detailed city trucks we've been getting during the last year or two"
p24422
aS' I used to have a preference for the late 80s/early 90s city line but some of these new sets have really surpassed them in detail and functionality'
p24423
aS'nice truck indeed, but the yellow one is better I think, at least if you put them on a roadplate it seems to me that those road plates are too small for that'
p24424
aS' Also it will not empty completely because of that panel'
p24425
aS' Well, for the rest it is a nice set and a fine review!'
p24426
aS"I own this set and I think it's a really nice truck, but there is two little details that I didn't like : 1/ a recycle truck really Needs 2 minifig, one to drive, one to put the garbage on the back"
p24427
aS' 2/ the big hole behind the driver seat, it was easy to fill it Like this : with hole POUF ! no more little hole! but this is really a great set anyway'
p24428
aS' 4/5 for me ( above average )'
p24429
aS'Nice review'
p24430
aS' This is a very nice vehicle, one of my favorite of the newer city ones'
p24431
aS' JopieK: There are two generations of road plate that are wide enough for six-wide vehicles like this'
p24432
aS' The current plates are dark grey with plain white printing, and look not great in my opinion'
p24433
aS' The previous ones are imo the best road plates of all time - green with dark grey road, white dotted line/zebras, drain covers and yellow verge markings (just like we really have here in Ireland)'
p24434
aS' For urban area I would still choose the green-edged plates and just cover up the green - the markings are so much better than the current plates'
p24435
aS'trop beau'
p24436

p24437
aS' Actually, it does'
p24438
aS" The back part of the truck with the panel hinges up, so that when you want the truck to dump, it doesn't get in the way"
p24439

p24441
aS" I should have taken a better look at the one my brother has ;) It still is a nice truck, much better than all the strange sets that were release those 'dark ages' before"
p24442
aS'A good set, with a nice color scheme'
p24443
aS' I still prefer the last one that had a removable bin'
p24444
aS'What a great set and a very nice review Erdbeereis'
p24445
aS' I think the only improvement to this set would have been the use of chrome exhaust pipes and front grill'
p24446
aS' I bought this set with a lot of excitement, but unfortunately have not put it together yet'
p24447
aS" What are your thoughts on these larger 6-stud wide detailed vehicles as opposed to 4-stud wide classics? Here's an image of 6668 Recycle Truck released in 1992: PS"
p24448
aS' I like the use of "taking out" Sponge Bob in your review'
p24449
aS"This looks like a great set, and I'm happy you were dumping spongebob, he deserves that"
p24450
aS' This set looks very nice, and if I see it I will probably pick it up'

aS" It's hard to say"
p24457
aS' I think if the older 4 wide cars and trucks were as well-designed as the new 6 wide ones, I might prefer those'
p24458
aS'Thanks for this review'
p24459
aS' I really love this set'
p24460
aS' It\'s perfect for my town, and brings a sense of "classic" when I see it'
p24461
aS"Thanks for the review! This is one of the few CITY sets that I own (despite loving the theme so much, most of my town is either custom or classic), and it's about as beautiful as a big garbage truck can ever be"
p24462
aS' Quote nice truck indeed, but the yellow one is better I think, at least if you put them on a roadplate it seems to me that those road plates are too small for that'
p24463
aS' Also it will not empty completely because of that panel'
p24464
aS" Well, for the rest it is a nice set and a fine review! Well, the truck BARELY fits onto the old roadplates (not on curves though), so if you put it in a display it probably won't look bad"
p24465
aS' I think from what I see, this and all the other 6 wide vehicles will fit much better on the newer roadplates, which are four studs wider than the old ones'
p24466
aS'Hi, I bought this set a while ago, and have since remodeled it into a larger 8 wide truck'
p24467
aS' Now it can hold a driver and passenger'
p24468
aS' Its kind of boxy, I may redesign it in the future'
p24469
aS"That's a really nice mod badsneaker! The added bulk serves it well"
p24470
aS'That looks like one of those big strange recycle trucks from new york city, i like it!'
p24471
aS"I like this set, but I can't give it a good grade for playability, as the rearmost hinging section is too stiffly hinged, so when you open it, it's likely to break if you hold it just over the shovel and broom"
p24472
aS' My truck thus has that function, and with it of course the whole container tipping, disabled'
p24473
aS' I also moved the cab a bit forward and the front axle rearward to give the cab the typical garbage truck look, as they are often very low slung'
p24474
aS' This also created space behind the cab for some equipment'

aS'Nice review I REALY need to pick up this set! and the Cement Truck too!'
p24477
aS'It would be cool if someone made a MOC in which hippies steal the truck and cover it with flowers and bright colors and stuff!'
